Financial Statements of the General Department    PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, 655 New York Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20001   T: (202) 414 1000, www.pwc.com/us       Report of Independent Auditors     To the  Board of Governors of the International Monetary Fund     Opinion     We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the General Department of the International  Monetary Fund (the “Department”), which comprise the  statements of financial position as of April 30,  2022 and 2021, and the related statements of income, of comprehensive income, of changes in reserves,  retained earnings, and resources, and of cash flows for the years then ended , including the related notes  (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”).     In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial  position of the Department as of April 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash  flows for the years then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued  by the International Accounting Standards Board.     Basis for Opinion     We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of  America (US GAAS) and in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our  responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibil ities for the Audit  of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of the International  Monetary Fund, and have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant  ethical requirements relatin g to our audit,  which include relevant ethical requirements in the United  States of America and the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for  Professional Accountants . We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and  appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.     Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial  Statements     Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the fina ncial statements in  accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting  Standards Board, and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the  preparation and fair presenta tion of financial statements that are free from material misstatement,  whether due to fraud or error.     In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Department’s ability to  continue as a going concern for at least, but not limited to, twelve months from the end of the reporting  period , disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of  accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Department or to cease operati ons, or has  no realistic alternative but to do so.           Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Department’s financial reporting  process.     Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements       Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are  free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that  includes our opinion . Reasonable assurance is a high l evel of assurance but is not absolute assurance and  therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with US GAAS and ISAs  will always  detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement result ing  from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional  omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material  if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment  made by a reasonable user based on the financial statements.     In performing an audit in accordance with US GAAS and ISAs we:    ● Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.   ● Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to  fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such  procedures include exam ining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in  the financial statements.   ● Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit  procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for  the purpose of expressing an  opinion on the effectiveness of the Department’s internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is  expressed.    ● Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant  accounting estimate s made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the  financial statements.   ● Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate,  that raise substantial doubt about the Department’s ability to c ontinue as a going concern for a  reasonable period of time.     We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the  planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal contr ol-related  matters that we identified during the audit.    Supplemental Information     Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the financial statements taken as a  whole. The accompanying supplemental schedules appearing on pages 40 to 48 as of April 30, 2022 and  for the years ended April 30, 2022 and 2021 (collectively referred to as the “supplemental schedules”) are  presented for purposes of additional analysis and are not a required part of the financial statements. The  supplemental s chedules are the responsibility of management and were derived from and relate directly to  the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the financial statements. The information  has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the au dit of the financial statements and certain  additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying  accounting and other records used to prepare the financial statements or to the financial statements     themselv es and other additional procedures, in accordance with US GAAS. We also subjected the  information to the applicable procedures required by ISAs. In our opinion, the supplemental schedules are  fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the fina ncial statements taken as a whole.         June 24, 2022       I.

Nature of operations  The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is an international  organization with 190 member countries. The IMF’s  fundamental mission is to en sure the stability of the  international monetary system. It does so in three ways:  surveillance of the global economy and the economies of  member countries; lending to  countries with balance of  payments difficulties; and giving practical help by providing technical assistance to members. It is headquartered in Washington, DC, USA.   The IMF conducts its operations and transactions through the  General Department. The General Department comprises three accounts: (i) the General  Resources Account (GRA);  (ii) the Investment Account (IA); and (iii) the Special Disbursement Account (SDA).  1.1  General Resources Account  The financial operations of the IMF with its members are  primarily conducted through the GRA. The assets and liabilities in the GRA reflect the payment of member quota  subscriptions, use and repayment of GRA credit, borrowings  and repayments to lenders, collection of charges from borrowers, payment of remuneration on creditor positions  and interest to lenders, and other operations.  A core responsibility of the IMF is to provide financial  assistance to member countries experiencing actual or  potential balance of payments pr oblems. Upon the request of  a member country, GRA resources are made available either  under a financing arrangement or in the form of outright  purchases (disbursements). An arrangement is a decision by  the IMF’s Executive Board (Executive Board) that gives a  member the assurance that the IMF stands ready to provide  resources to the member during a specified period and up to a specified amount, in accordance with the terms of the  relevant financing instrument.   The Stand-By Arrangement (SBA)  is designed for members  with balance of payments problems expected to be resolved  in the short to medium term. The Extended Fund Facility  (EFF) is a special facility in the GRA for members with longer-term balance of payments problems, the resolution of  which would require structural and more comprehensive  economic reforms. Resources under the SBA and the EFF are made available in phased installments as the member  implements economic policies and measures specified under the arrangement, subject to periodic reviews by the  Executive Board.  The Flexible Credit Line (FCL) is available for members with  very strong fundamentals, policies, and track records of  policy implementation and is intended for both crisis prevention and resolution. The Short-term Liquidity Line  (SLL) is designed to provide liquidity support and has several  innovative features, including revolving access. It has the  same qualification criteria as the FCL but is available only for  members facing potential moderate short-term balance of  payments needs arising due to capital account pressures.  The Precautionary and Liquidity Line (PLL) is available for  members with sound economic fundamentals but with some remaining vulnerabilities that pr eclude them from meeting the  qualification criteria for the FCL and the SLL.   The financing instrument for outright purchases is the Rapid  Financing Instrument (RFI), which is used by members facing  an urgent balance of payments need without the necessity or  capacity for a full-fledged program.  1.2  Investment Account  The IA holds resources transferred from the GRA, which are  invested to broaden the IMF’s income base. The Rules and Regulations of the IA adopted  by the Executive Board  provide the framework for the implementation of the expanded investment authorit y authorized under the Fifth  Amendment of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, which  became effective in February 2011. The IA comprises two  subaccounts: the Fixed-Income Subaccount and the Endowment Subaccount.   The Fixed-Income Subaccount holds resources transferred  from the GRA that are not relat ed to profits from gold sales.  With a view to generating income while protecting the IMF’s  balance sheet, the investment objective of the Fixed-Income  Subaccount is to produce returns in Special Drawing Rights  (SDRs) terms in excess of the th ree-month SDR interest rate  (see Notes 2.1 and 2.2) over time while minimizing the  frequency and extent of negative returns and  underperformance over an investment horizon of three to  four years. During financial year ended April 30, 2022, the  Executive Board concluded its 5- yearly review of the Fixed- Income Subaccount’s investment strategy and effective January 12, 2022, set the investment objective to achieve, over time, returns that exceed  the SDR interest rate by a  margin of 50 basis points. I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021    12 The Endowment Subaccount was credited with  SDR 4.4 billion in profits fr om gold sales during financial  years 2010 and 2011. The Endowment Subaccount’s investment objective is to achieve a real return of 3 percent in US dollar terms over the long term to contribute to covering  the IMF’s administrative expenditures, while preserving the  long-term real value of these assets.   1.3  Special Disbursement Account  The SDA is the vehicle used to receive profits from the sale of gold held by the IMF at  the time of the Second  Amendment of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement (April 1978).  SDA resources can be used for various purposes, as  specified in the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, including transfers to the GRA for immediate use in operations and  transactions, transfers to the IA, or operations and  transactions that are not authorize d by other provisions of the  IMF’s Articles of Agreement but are consis tent with the  mandate of the IMF, in particular to provide balance of payments assistance on special terms to low-income  member countries.  1.4  Other entities administered by the IMF  The IMF also administers the Special Drawing Rights  Department (SDR Department ), trusts (Concessional  Lending and Debt Relief Trusts), and special purpose accounts (Administered Accounts) established to fund financial and technical services consistent with the IMF’s  purposes. As the General Department does not have control  over these entities, their finan cial statements are presented  separately.  The resources of the SDR Department are held separately  from the assets of all t he other accounts owned or  administered by the IMF. As specified in the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, these resources may not be used to meet the liabilities, obligations, or losses incurred in the operations of  the General Department (or vice versa), except that  expenses of conducting the business of the SDR Department are paid by the General De partment and are then reimbursed  by the SDR Department.   The resources of the trusts and special purpose accounts are  contributed by members, by other  financial institutions, or by  the IMF through the SDA. The a ssets and liabilities of the  trusts and special purpose accounts are separate from the assets and liabilities of the General Department. The assets  of the trusts and special purpose accounts cannot be used to  meet the liabilities, obligations, or losses incurred in the  operations of the General  Department. The General  Department can be reimbursed for the expenses incurred in  conducting the business of certain trusts and accounts in  accordance with the IMF’s Articles of Agreement and  relevant decisions of the Executive Board. 1.5  Impact of geopolitical and global economic  developments  The COVID-19 pandemic has cr eated severe disruptions in  global economic activity. The IMF responded to the crisis  with unprecedented speed and  magnitude of financial  assistance, to help countries, notably to protect the most vulnerable and set the stage for economic recovery. A significant number of countri es benefited from emergency  financing through RFI purchases during the financial year ended April 30, 2021 (see Note 5.1). The IMF has also approved financial assistance under its lending arrangements  and augmented existing lending arrangements to  accommodate new needs arising from the impact of the pandemic during the financial years ended April 30, 2022,  and 2021 (see Schedule 3). As a result of this increased  financing activity, the General Department’s credit exposure has increased compared with the pre-pandemic level.  The evolution of the pandemic is  still subject to significant  uncertainty. Beyond April 30, 2022, slowing global growth  and elevated debt vulnerabilities could lead to further  demand for lending arrangements in the coming months. The war in Ukraine that started in February 2022 is expected to  have a significant negative effect on global growth through  commodity markets, trade, and, to a lesser extent, financial interlinkages. Economic and financial spillovers from the war  could also trigger additional demand for Fund financing.   The General Department continues to manage its risks in  accordance with its existing risk management framework  (see Note 4). As of the date of  these financial statements,  there had been no negative impact on the operational results of the General Department, in cluding from the impairment  analysis of its credit portfolio (see Note 5.1). See also Note  2.3 for the most significant estimates and judgements used in  the preparation of thes e financial statements.  The risk management practices described in Note 4.3 have  effectively mitigated the risk exposure of the effects of the  global developments on the investment portfolios. The  valuations of mark-to-market  financial instruments had fully  and rapidly recovered after a brief decline in value at the  onset of the pandemic. However,  in light of the war in  Ukraine, tightening monetary c onditions coupled with a sharp  increase in inflation and inflat ion expectations, the investment  portfolios remain subject to challenging market conditions  and high volatility. The effects of the global developments on  investments are also reflected in the value at risk (VaR) (see  Note 4.3.2.3). The valuation of  investments held at amortized  cost was not impacted. I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021     13 2.  Basis of preparation and measurement  The financial statements of t he General Department are  prepared in accordance with International Financial  Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International  Accounting Standards B oard (IASB). The financial  statements have been prepared under the historical cost  convention, except for the revalu ation of financial instruments  at fair value through profit or  loss. The financial statements  have also been prepared on t he basis that the General  Department will continue to op erate as a going concern.  2.1  Unit of account  The financial statements are presented in SDRs, which is the  IMF’s unit of account. The value of the SDR is determined  daily by the IMF by summing specific amounts of the basket  currencies in US dollar equivalents on the basis of market exchange rates. The IMF generally reviews the composition  of the SDR valuation basket at  five-year intervals. These  reviews cover the currencies to be included in the SDR valuation basket (along with the criteria for the selection of  currencies), determine the relative weights of those  currencies, and assess the fi nancial instruments that are  used to calculate the SDR interest rate. The current basket consists of five currencies. The weights and amounts of the  currencies in the basket, at April 30, 2022, and April 30,  2021, relative to 1 SDR, were as follows:  SDR basket curren cy Weight (in percent) Amount  Chinese renminbi 10.92 1.0174  Euro 30.93 0.38671  Japanese yen 8.33 11.900  Pound sterling 8.09 0.085946  US dollar  41.73 0.58252    At April 30, 2022, SDR 1 was equal to US$1.34430  (US$1.43599 at April 30, 2021).  The current SDR valuation basket was originally scheduled  to expire on September 30, 2021. However, the Executive  Board decided to extend it to July 31, 2022.  On May 11, 2022, the Exec utive Board concluded the  quinquennial review of the me thod of valuation of the SDR  and agreed to maintain the curr ent composition of the SDR  currency and interest rate baskets and approved their  updated weights. The updated basket implies slightly higher weights for the US dollar and the Chinese renminbi and,  accordingly, somewhat lower we ights for the British pound,  the euro, and the Japanese yen.   Effective August 1, 2022, t he SDR basket valuation basket  will be assigned the following weights:  SDR basket currency Weight (in percent)  Chinese renminbi 12.28  Euro 29.31  Japanese yen 7.59  Pound sterling 7.44  US dollar  43.38    The amounts of each of the five  currencies will be calculated  on July 29, 2022 (the transition date) in accordance with the  new weights. The next review of the method of valuation of  the SDR will take place in 2027, unless developments in the  interim justify an earlier review.   2.2  SDR interest rate  The SDR interest rate provides the basis for basic charges  levied on credit outstanding (see Note 17), interest on SDR  holdings (see Note 6), remuneration paid on members’  reserve tranche positions (see Note 18), and interest on  borrowings (see Note 14).   The SDR interest rate is determined weekly by reference to a  weighted average of yields or rates on short-term instruments  in the money markets of the members whose currencies are  included in the SDR valuation basket:   SDR basket currency Yield or rate  Chinese renminbi Three-month benchmark yield for China  Treasury bonds as published by the China  Central Depository and Clearing Co., Ltd.  Euro Three-month spot rate for euro area central  government bonds with a minimum rating of  AA published by the European Central  Bank  Japanese yen Three-month Treasury discount bills  Pound sterling Three-month Treasury bills  US dollar Three-month Treasury bills    The SDR interest rate is subject to a floor of 0.050 percent  and is rounded to three decimal places.   The average SDR interest rate was 0.107 percent per annum  and 0.077 percent per annum during the financial years  ended April 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively.  2.3  Use of estimates and judgement  The preparation of financ ial statements requires  management to make judgements, estimates, and assumptions that affect the app lication of accounting policies  and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.  Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an  ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021    14 recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised  and in any future periods affected.  The most significant estimates and judgements used in  applying accounting policies include expected credit losses measurement for credit outstanding and undrawn  commitments (see Notes 3.2.1.1 and 5.1), fair value  measurement of financial inst ruments (see Notes 3.10 and  8), and actuarial assumptions used in calculating the net assets/liabilities under retirement benefit plans (see Note 11.3).  3.  Summary of significant accounting policies  3.1  Financial instruments   Financial instruments include financial assets and financial liabilities described in Notes 3.2 and 3.7.  Measurement at initial recognition  Financial instruments are recognized when the General Department becomes a party to the contractual provisions of  the instrument. The General Department uses settlement  date accounting for all financial instruments except for  investments, which are accounted for using trade date  accounting (see Note 3.2.3). At initial recognition, a financial instrument is measured at it s fair value, which is best  evidenced by the transaction amount.   Derecognition Financial assets, or a portion thereof, are derecognized when  the contractual rights to rece ive the cash flows from the  assets have expired, or when they have been transferred and  either: (i) the General Department  transfers substantially all  the risks and rewards of owners hip; or (ii) the General  Department neither transfers nor retains substantially all the  risks and rewards of ownership but the General Department  has not retained control.   Financial liabilities are derecognized when they are  extinguished (i.e., when the obligation is discharged,  canceled, or expires).   Classification and subsequent measurement of  financial assets  A financial asset is classified on initial recognition based on two factors: the business model for managing the financial  asset and its contractual cash flow characteristics.   Financial assets that are held for collection of contractual  cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and intere st are measured at amortized  cost (AC). Interest income fr om these financial assets is  included in the statements of  income using the effective interest method. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is  recognized in the statements of income.   Financial assets that are held for collection of contractual  cash flows and for selling, where the assets’ cash flows  represent solely payments of principal and interest, would be  measured at fair value through other comprehensive income  (FVOCI). The General Departm ent did not have financial  assets at FVOCI during the financial years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021.  All other financial assets that do not meet the criteria to be  measured at AC or FVOCI are measured at fair value, with  changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss (FVPL).  Impairment  At each reporting date, the General Department assesses on  a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses (ECL)  associated with its financial assets at AC and with the  undrawn balances under its lending commitments. The  measurement of ECL reflects: (i) an unbiased and probability-weighted amou nt that is determined by evaluating  a range of possible outcomes; (ii) the time value of money; and (iii) reasonable and suppor table information that is  available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date about past events, current conditions, and forecasts of future economic conditions.   If the General Department neede d to recognize ECL, they  would be recorded as impairment allowances for assets at AC and as a liability provision for undrawn commitments.   Should any financial asset become credit-impaired, interest  income would be calculated for it by applying the effective interest rate to its amortized co st (i.e., net of the impairment  allowance).  Classification and subsequent measurement of  financial liabilities  Derivative financial liabilities are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss.   All other financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost. Interest expense from these financial liabilities is included in the statements of income using t he effective interest method.   3.2  Financial assets  3.2.1  Currencies  Currencies are financial assets that consist of members’  currencies held by the GRA with designated depositories, in  the form of account balances or non-interest-bearing  promissory notes that ar e encashable by the GRA on  demand. All currencies in the GRA are classified at AC. I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021     15  Usable currencies are currencies of members considered  to be in a sufficiently strong external position that they can  be used to finance GRA transactions with other members.    Currencies of members that are not considered to have a  sufficiently strong balance of payments and reserves  position to finance GRA transactions with other members are presented as other currencies.    Holdings of member currencies that represent purchases of usable currencies or SDRs in exchange for their own  currencies are presented as credit outstanding (see Note  3.2.1.1).   The currency balances in the statements of financial position include receivables and payables arising from currency  revaluations (see Note 5).  3.2.1.1  Credit outstanding and charges  Credit outstanding is a financial asset that represents  financing provided to members under the various GRA financing facilities (see Note 1.1). Members receive financing  in the GRA by purchasing SDRs or usable currencies in  exchange for their own currencies. GRA credit is repaid by  members by repurchasing holdings of their currencies in  exchange for SDRs or usable currencies.   Charges and fees  The GRA earns interest, referred to as basic charges, on  members’ use of GRA credit (see Note 17). Basic charges are recognized using the e ffective interest method.    In addition to basic charges, outstanding GRA credit is also subject to level-based and time-based surcharges (see Note 17). Surcharges are recognized when the relevant  level-based and time-based thresholds on credit outstanding  set by the Executive Board are reached.   Charges not received from members within the required  timeframe are recovered by the GRA under the burden- sharing mechanism, through adjustments to increase the rate  of charge for debtor member s and decrease the rate of  remuneration on members’ reserve tranche positions (see  Note 13.1).   A service charge is levied by the GRA on all purchases from  the GRA except reserve tranche purchases. Service charges are paid when the purchases are made and are recognized  as income upon payment.   A commitment fee is levied on the amount available for  financing under an arrangement for each 12-month period of  the arrangement. Except for SLL arrangements, commitment  fees are refunded as the member makes purchases under  the relevant arrangement. A prorated commitment fee is also  refunded for all arrangements in case of an arrangement’s cancellation. At the arrangement’s expiration or cancellation, any unrefunded amount is recognized as income. Pending refund or recognition as income, commitment fees are  recognized as part of other li abilities in the statements of  financial position. For SLL arrangements, the commitment  fee is nonrefundable upon purchases. Accordingly,  commitment fee income is recognized on a straight-line basis  over the duration of the SLL arrangement.  Impairment of credit outstanding The General Department’s assessment for impairment of its credit outstanding is grounded in  the context of the nature of  the IMF’s financing and its un ique institutional status:     The IMF has a unique relationship with its member countries, all of which are shar eholders in the institution.    IMF financing under arrangements is linked to regular reviews of performance under a program of economic  policies that the member commits to in order to overcome  balance of payments problems, return to external viability, and repay the IMF.    The IMF employs a comprehensive set of measures to mitigate credit risk (see Note 4.2.1).   The IMF also has de facto pref erred creditor status, which  has been recognized by the official community and generally accepted by private creditors.  Taken together, these factor s significantly reduce the  likelihood of the General Department incurring credit losses.   The General Department has not recognized any impairment  losses since inception. Also, unlik e large financial institutions  in the private sector, the General Department’s credit portfolio consists of a relatively small number of exposures to  its member countries, with eac h member’s circumstances  varying. Therefore, a stat istical approach to credit risk  assessment, such as probability of default (PD) and loss given default (LGD) modeling, as typically followed in the financial sector is neither feasible nor appropriate for the  General Department.   Similarly, the assessment of t he General Department’s credit  risk cannot rely on external credit risk ratings. Due to its  unique characteristics, the IMF’ s credit risk exposure is not  comparable to sovereign credit risk faced by commercial  financial entities and, as a cooperative member organization,  the IMF does not produce its own internal credit rating  grades. Accordingly, credit risk for the General Department is  assessed holistically based on  qualitative an d quantitative  considerations pertaining to each debtor member, such as  the status of the economic programs underlying IMF  financing, the member’s cooperation on policy  implementation and timely settlement of IMF financial obligations, and forward-looking assessment of the member’s  capacity to repay. I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021    16 The General Department has developed a model for ECL  estimation based on changes in credit quality since initial  recognition, where credit qualit y is referred to as Stage 1,  Stage 2, and Stage 3. Credit out standing for which credit risk  has increased significantly since initial recognition (Stage 2), or that is credit-impaired (S tage 3), has its ECL measured on  a lifetime basis. Credit outstan ding for which there has been  no significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition  (Stage 1) has its ECL measured as a portion of lifetime ECL  that result from default events possible within the next  12 months.  The key judgements and assumptions adopted by the  General Department in t he measurement of ECL are  discussed below :  (i) Definition of defaul t and credit-impaired   The General Department considers a member country to be  in default when it is six months or more overdue in settling its  financial obligations to the General Department. This rebuts the presumption that  default occurs no later than 90 days  past due, reflecting the nature of the IMF’s financing and its unique institutional status as well as consistency with the  threshold for internal risk management purposes. Credit outstanding is considered cred it-impaired when the obligation  has defaulted.   (ii) Significant increase in credit risk  The General Department assesses whether a significant increase in credit risk has occurred on a member-by-member  basis by comparing the risk of default at the reporting date  with the risk of default at t he date of the most recent  disbursement to the debtor member. The assessment is  performed on each reporting date and takes into account a  range of qualitative and quantitative criteria, including  overdue obligations to the IMF, signals of noncooperation by  the member, and forward-looking indicators of capacity to repay the IMF. The criteria used to identify significant  increases in credit risk are monitored and reviewed for  appropriateness at least annually.   The assessment does not rely on any single factor and may,  on the basis of other relevant considerations, rebut the  presumption that credit risk has increased significantly when contractual payments are mo re than 30 days past due.  During the financial years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021, the General Department did not have any member more than 30 days past due, except for one member in protracted  arrears at April 30, 2021, which were subsequently settled  (see Note 5.2).  (iii) Low credit risk   The General Department assumes that the credit risk of a member country has not increased significantly since initial recognition if the member is determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date, as defined below.   Credit risk related to the General Department’s exposure to a member country is considered low if: (i) it has a low risk of default; (ii) the member country  has a strong capacity to meet  its contractual cash flow obligations in the near term; and (iii) adverse changes in economic and business conditions in  the longer term may, but will not necessarily, reduce the  ability of the member country to fulfill its contractual cash flow  obligations.   (iv) Measuring ECL  ECL are determined by comparing expected cash flows with contractual cash flows and discounting the expected cash  shortfalls at the effective interest  rate, which is the basic rate  of charge. ECL are estima ted by assessing a range of  possible outcomes in light of expected future economic  conditions, weighted according to the assessed probability of  each outcome. This entails considerable judgement and uncertainty about the estimates.   For the purpose of ECL measurement, financial safeguards that are integral to the IMF’s financial structure and  operations are also considered, such as the burden-sharing  mechanism to compensa te the IMF for loss of income due to  overdue payments (see Note  13.1) and the Special  Contingent Account (SCA-1) to pr otect the IMF in case of the  ultimate failure of a member to repay its overdue obligations to the GRA (see Note 13.2).  Write-off  In the unlikely event that a member with credit outstanding (i) withdraws from the IMF; ( ii) repudiates its outstanding  obligations to the General Depar tment; and (iii) there are no  prospects of recovering amounts due to the General  Department in the foreseeable future, the IMF would  recognize the ultimate loss and the withdrawn member’s credit outstanding to the G eneral Department would be  written off.   3.2.2  SDR holdings   SDR holdings represent SDRs held by the GRA (see Note 6).  SDR holdings are measured at AC.  Interest on SDR holdings is recognized using the effective  interest method.   3.2.3  Investments   Investments are financial assets that include equity securities, real estate investment trusts (REITs), private  infrastructure debt, fixed-in come securities, short-term  investments, fixed-term deposits, and derivative assets. Derivative liabilities are disclosed as part of other liabilities in  the statements of fi nancial position.  I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021     17 Investments in each of the tw o subaccounts are managed in  accordance with their respective investment strategy (see  Note 7) and their performance is evaluated on a fair value  basis. The business model for the invested portfolios focuses on achieving fair value gains. Accordingly, these securities  are classified at FVPL. Funds pending suitable investment in  accordance with the investment  strategy may be kept in  fixed-term deposits, which are measured at amortized cost.  Purchases and sales of investments are recognized on the  trade date. The corresponding investment trades receivable  or payable are recognized in other assets and other liabilities,  respectively, pending settlement of a transaction.  Investment income compri ses interest income on  investments at AC, interest and dividend income, and  realized and unrealized gains and losses from FVPL investments, including currency valuation differences arising  from exchange rate movements against the SDR, net of all  trading-related fees.  Interest income from investments is recognized using the  effective interest method. Dividend income is recognized  based on the ex-dividend date.  3.3  Cash and cash equivalents   Usable currencies and SDR holdings are considered cash and cash equivalents in the statements of cash flows.  3.4  Gold holdings  Gold holdings (acquired prior to the Second Amendment of  the IMF’s Articles of Agreement in April 1978) are carried at  historical cost using the spec ific identification method. The  carrying value is determined by the restrictions on the use of  the IMF’s gold holdings and the di sposition of profits from the  sale of gold. In accordance with the provisions of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, whenever the IMF sells gold that was  held on the date of the e ffectiveness of the Second  Amendment of the IMF’s Articles  of Agreement, that portion  of the proceeds equal to the hist orical cost must be placed in  the GRA. Any proceeds in excess of the historical cost will be held in the SDA or transferred to the Endowment Subaccount  of the IA (see Note 9). The IMF may also sell such gold  holdings to those members that were members on August 1, 1975, in exchange for their currencies and at a price equal to  the historical cost.  3.5  Property, plant and equipment and intangible  assets  Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are  measured at historical cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization. Property, plant and equipment and intangible  assets are capitalized and depreciated or amortized over the  estimated remaining useful lives using the straight-line method. Buildings are deprecia ted over 30 years and other  property, plant and equipment over 3 to 20 years. Leasehold  improvements are depreciated ov er the term of the lease  agreement. Software is amortized over three to five years.  3.6  Post-employment benefits  The IMF sponsors various post-employment benefit plans for its employees, which include defined benefit and other  post-employment benefits such as medical and life insurance  benefits (see Note 11).  The net asset/liability under each retirement benefits plan  recognized in the statements of financial position is the  present value of the defined ben efit obligation less the fair  value of the plan assets. Changes resulting from remeasurements are reported in other comprehensive  income. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined using the projecte d unit credit method by  discounting the estimated future cash outflows using market  yields on high-quality corporate bonds.   Net periodic pension cost includes service cost and net  interest cost on the net asse ts/liabilities under retirement  benefit plans.  3.7  Financial liabilities  3.7.1  Special Contingent Account The SCA-1 was used by the General Department to  accumulate precautionary balances under the burden- sharing mechanism (see Note 13.2) against possible credit  default. Balances in the SCA-1 are akin to refundable non-interest-bearing deposits.   3.7.2  Borrowings   Borrowings are financial liabilities that represent financing  received under the various borrowing arrangements  (see Note 14).  Interest expense on borrowings is calculated by applying the  effective interest method.   3.7.3  Quota subscriptions   Members’ quota subscriptions are financial liabilities that  represent subscription payments by members, including  payments as a result of quota increases (see Note 15.1). An increase in quota subscription for an existing member  becomes effective when the member both consents to the  quota increase and makes the actual payment (provided that any other requirements for the effectiveness of the specific  quota increase are met), and the increase is recorded in the financial statements on the payment  date. Typically, about a  quarter of a member’s quota subscription (reserve asset portion) is paid either in SDRs or in the currencies of other members specified by the IMF, or in any combination of I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021    18 SDRs and such currencies; and the remainder is paid in the  member’s own currency.   Quota subscriptions are cla ssified as liabilities in the  statements of financial position, as they embody an  unconditional repayment obligation in the case of a member’s  withdrawal from the IMF.  3.7.3.1  Reserve tranche positions and remuneration  A member acquires a reserve tranche position in the GRA in  exchange for the reserve asset portion of its quota subscription payment, and from the use of the member’s  currency in the GRA’s transactions or operations (see  Note 15.2).   The GRA pays interest, referr ed to as remuneration, on a  remunerated portion of t he member’s reserve tranche  position (see Note 18). Remuneration expense is recognized  on an accrual basis.   3.8  Provisions  Provisions are recognized when the IMF has a current legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is  probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made. Provisions are measured at  the present value of the amoun ts that are expected to be  paid to settle the obligations.  3.9  Foreign currency translation  Transactions denominated in currencies and not in SDRs are  recorded at the rate of exchange on the date of the  transaction. Assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies are reported using the SDR exchange rate on the  date of the financial statements. Exchange differences  arising from the settlement of transactions at rates different  from those at the originating date of the transactions are  included in the determination of net income.  3.10  Fair value measurement  Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between  market participants at the m easurement date. A fair value  measurement is based on th e presumption that the  transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either in the principal market for the asset or liability or, in the absence of a principal market, in the most  advantageous market.  A three-level fair value hierarchy is used to determine fair  value under which financial instruments are categorized  based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique. The fair value hierarchy has the following levels:  When the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset  or liability fall within multiple le vels of the hierarchy, the level  within which the fair value me asurement is categorized is  based on the lowest-level input t hat is significant to the fair  value measurement of the instrument in its entirety. Thus, a  Level 3 fair value measurement may include inputs that are  both observable and unobservable. Transfers in and out of  the fair value hierarchy levels  are recognized at the end of  the reporting period.  The valuation techniques used to determine fair value are  described in Note 8.  3.11  Amendments to existing standards that became  effective in the financial year ended April 30, 2022  Amendments to IFRS 9, “Financial Instruments”, and IFRS 7,  “Financial Instruments: Disclosures” were issued in August 2020 to address financial reporting issues related to the  reform of an interest rate benchmark, including its  replacement with alternative benchmark rates. The  amendments are effective for annual periods starting on or  after January 1, 2021, and were adopted by the General  Department on May 1, 2021. The amendments had no  material effect on the General Department’s financial  statements.  3.12  Amendments to existing standards effective in  future years  The following amendments to existing standards issued by  the IASB will become effective in  future financial years.   Amendments to IFRS 9, “Financial Instruments” were issued in May 2020 to clarify certain aspects of derecognition of financial liabilities. The amendm ents are effective for annual  periods starting on or after January 1, 2022. The amendments will be adopted by t he General Department for  the financial year ending Ap ril 30, 2023, and are not  expected to have a material effect on the General Department’s financial statements.  Amendments to IAS 1, “Pre sentation of Financial  Statements” and IFRS Prac tice Statement 2, “Making  Materiality Judgements” were issued in February 2021 to  help entities apply materiality judgements to accounting  policy disclosures. The amendments are effective for annual Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical  assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the  measurement date;   Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly  (i.e., derived from prices);  Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021     19 periods starting on or after January 1, 2023. The  amendments will be adopted by t he General Department for  the financial year ending Ap ril 30, 2024, and are not  expected to have a material effect on the General Department’s financial statements.  Amendments to IAS 8, “Accounting Policies, Changes in  Accounting Estimates and Errors” were issued in February  2021 to clarify the definition of accounting estimate. The  amendments are effective for annual periods starting on or  after January 1, 2023. The amendments will be adopted by  the General Department for the financial year ending  April 30, 2024, and are not expected to have a material effect on the General Department’ s financial statements.  4.  Financial risk management   The General Department is exposed to various types of  operational and financial risks, including credit, market, and  liquidity risks.  4.1  Risk management framework  By virtue of its role establishe d through the IMF’s Articles of  Agreement, the IMF faces a range of financial and nonfinancial risks. The Executive Board has approved a risk  acceptance statement guiding risk acceptance and  assessment across the IMF’s activities. The IMF has adopted the three lines of defense model for risk management.   Risks inherent in day-to-day o perations are mitigated by  establishing and main taining a system of internal controls.   A risk management function is responsible for developing  and maintaining the risk management framework, fostering the development of  risk management tools, and  reporting on the General Depart ment’s overall risk profile,  highlighting areas where additional mitigation efforts are needed.    An internal audit function is responsible for providing an independent assessment of  the effectiveness of  governance and internal control processes.    Oversight is provided by committees established to monitor  and make decisions in specific risk areas, which supports the  cycle of risk assessment, ownership, and mitigation vis-à-vis risk acceptance.   4.2  Financial assets and liabilities other than  investments  Financial assets and liabilities other than investments are  exposed to credit, market, and liquidity risks. 4.2.1  Credit risk on financial assets and liabilities other than  investments  Credit risk is the risk of suffering financial losses, should any  of the IMF’s members fail to fulfill their financial obligations to the GRA. Credit risk arises on credit outstanding and  undrawn committed amounts under approved financing  commitments.  Credit risk is inherent in the IMF’s unique role in the  international monetary system  because the IMF has limited  ability to diversify its credit portfolio and generally provides  financing when other sources of credit are not available to a  member. In addition, the IMF’s credit concentration is generally high due to the nature of the financial assistance  provided to its member countries.  Measures to help mitigate the IMF’s credit risk in financing  arrangements include program design and conditionality,  which serve to help member countries solve their balance of  payments problems within the period of an IMF-supported program and to provide the ne eded assurances that the  member will be able to repay the IMF. Other risk mitigating policies include access limits, post financing assessments,  surcharge policies, preventive and remedial measures for  dealing with overdue financial obligations, and the burden- sharing mechanism (see Note 13).   The IMF has established limits on overall access to  resources in the GRA, except for the FCL arrangements that are not subject to any access limits (for limits applicable to  SLL arrangements, see below). The annual limit is normally  set at 145 percent of a member ’s quota, with a cumulative  limit of 435 percent of a mem ber’s quota (net of scheduled  repurchases). In response to the COVID-19 crisis, the annual  limit was temporarily increased to 245 percent of quota  annually for the period from July 13, 2020, through  December 31, 2021.   Access in excess of these limits can be granted in  exceptional circumstances. Except for PLL arrangements,  there is no prespecified maximum on exceptional access to IMF resources, which is assessed on a case-by-case basis in  accordance with the policy framework on exceptional access.  The IMF assesses factors such as the size of balance of  payments needs, the member’s debt sustainability and its  ability to regain access to financing from other sources, the  member’s capacity to repay the Fund, and the strength of  policies to be adopted.   PLL arrangements have a cumulative access limit of  500 percent of quota (net of scheduled repurchases). Access  under a six-month PLL arrangement is subject to a limit of  125 percent of quota. In exceptional circumstances where a member is experiencing or has the potential to experience  larger short-term balance of payments needs due to the I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021    20 impact of exogenous shocks, including heightened regional  or global stress conditions, access under a six-month PLL  arrangement is subject to a higher limit of 250 percent of  quota.  SLL arrangements have revolving access, and multiple  purchases and repurchases may take place during the  course of the arrangement, subj ect to a limit of 145 percent  of quota on the total credit outstanding at any given date under current or any prior SLL arrangements.   Further, in September 2020, the IMF established policy  safeguards when a member requests financing with  combined access to GRA and Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRG Trust) resources in excess of specified  thresholds. These thresholds are set at the same levels that  trigger application of the GRA exceptional access framework.  The safeguards are also broadly aligned with the criteria and  procedures applied in the GRA exceptional access  framework described above. There were no limits on combined access to GRA and PRG Trust resources prior to  September 2020.  The annual limit for RFI purchases is normally set at 50  percent of a member’s quota, with a cumulative limit of 100  percent of a member’s quota ( net of scheduled repurchases).  These limits were temporarily increased to 100 percent of  quota annually and 150 percent of  quota cumulatively (net of  scheduled repurchases) for the period from April 6, 2020,  through June 30, 2023.  Purchases under SBA and EFF arrangements are made in  tranches and are subject to conditionality in the form of performance criteria, indicative targets, structural  benchmarks, and prior actions, as well as regular reviews by  the Executive Board.   In addition, the IMF has adopted a safeguards policy to  mitigate the risk of misuse of resources and a misreporting policy to deal with incorrect reporting of data or performance  against any conditions under an IMF-supported program.  Safeguards assessments of member central banks are undertaken to provide the IMF with reasonable assurance  that the central bank’s legal structure, governance, control,  reporting, and auditing systems are adequate to maintain the integrity of its operations and to manage resources, including  IMF disbursements. When IMF resources are provided as  direct budget financing to the government, the safeguards policy also requires that IMF disbursements be deposited at  the central bank, and that an appropriate framework  agreement between the central bank and the government be  in place to ensure timely servicing of the member’s financial  obligations to the IMF. Further, a fiscal safeguards review of the state treasury is requir ed for cases where a member requests exceptional access, and at least 25 percent of IMF funds are expected to be used fo r direct budget financing.   The maximum credit risk exposure is the carrying value of the IMF’s credit outstanding a nd undrawn commitments.   4.2.1.1  Credit outstanding  Credit outstanding comprised SDR 93,031 million and  SDR 89,788 million at April 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively  (see Note 5). The concentration of GRA outstanding credit by  region was as follows:     The use of credit in the GRA by the largest users was as  follows:    The five largest users of GRA credit at April 30, 2022, and 2021, in descending order, were Argentina, Egypt, Ukraine,  Pakistan, and Ecuador. Credit outstanding by member is  presented in Schedule 1.  In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant number  of countries have benefited from emergency financial  assistance under the RFI (see Note 5.1), including 21  countries with a total disbursed amount of SDR 9,480 million  that did not have credit outst anding from the IMF at March  31, 2020. There is no ex-post program-based conditionality or reviews under the RFI, with overall conditionality limited.  4.2.1.2  Undrawn commitments  Undrawn commitments under GRA arrangements amounted  to SDR 102,614 million and SDR 93,457 million at April 30,  2022, and 2021, respectively. Commitments and undrawn balances under current arrangements are presented in  Schedule 3.   April 30, 2022  April 30, 2021  (in millions of SDRs and as a percentage  of total GRA credit outstanding)   Africa 12,305 13.2% 10,438 11.6%  Asia and Pacific 1,833 2.0% 1,886 2.1%  Europe  8,675 9.3% 9,914 11.0%  Middle East and Central  Asia 24,864 26.7% 24,490 27.3%  Western Hemisphere  45,354 48.8% 43,060 48.0%  Total 93,031 100.0% 89,788 100.0%   April 30, 2022  April 30, 2021   (in millions of SDRs and as a percentage of  total GRA credit outstanding)   Largest user of credit  33,221 35.7% 31,914 35.5%  Three largest users of  credit  54,708 58.8% 52,294 58.2%  Five largest users   of credit  65,001 69.9% 62,067 69.1%  I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021     21 No purchases under RFIs had been approved by the  Executive Board, but not yet disbursed at April 30, 2022  (SDR 630 million at April 30, 2021).   The undrawn commitments under GRA arrangements have  also increased as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic (see  Note 1.5) as the IMF has approved new financial assistance under its lending arrangements (including to four countries  that had not had a lending arrangement with, or credit  outstanding to the IMF at Ma rch 31, 2020) and augmented  existing lending arrangements to accommodate urgent new  needs arising from the impact of the pandemic.  4.2.2  Market risk on financial assets and liabilities other than  investments Market risk is the risk that the fa ir value or future cash flows  of financial instruments will fl uctuate because of changes in  market prices. Market risk for financial assets and liabilities other than investments includes interest rate risk and  exchange rate risk.  4.2.2.1  Interest rate risk  Interest rate risk is the risk t hat future net cash flows will  fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. All interest-bearing financial instru ments other than investments  of the General Department accr ue interest either at the SDR  interest rate or at a rate that is linked to the SDR interest rate  (see Note 2.2). Interest rate risk is primarily managed by  linking the rate of charge directly, by means of a fixed margin, to the cost of financing (which is equal to the SDR  interest rate).   4.2.2.2  Exchange rate risk  Exchange rate risk is the risk that the General Department’s  financial position and cash flows will be affected by  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.    The General Department has no exchange rate risk  exposure on its holdings of members’ currencies in the GRA because members maintain the value of such  holdings in SDR terms (see Note 5).    The General Department has other assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than SDRs and makes  administrative payments largely in US dollars, but the exchange rate risk exposure associated with these  activities is limited.    The General Department has no exchange rate exposure  from its current borrowing arrangements because all  drawings are denominated in SDRs.  4.2.3  Liquidity risk on financial assets and liabilities other than investments  Liquidity risk is the risk to the General Department of  nonavailability of resources to meet the financing needs of  members and its own obligations. The IMF must have usable resources available to meet members’ demand for IMF  financing. While the IMF’s resources are largely of a  revolving nature, uncertainties in the timing and amount of  credit extended to members during financial crises expose the IMF to liquidity risk. Moreover, the IMF must also stand  ready to provide resources for unexpected needs, for  example, to: (i) meet, upon a member’s representation of  need, potential demands for a drawing on the member’s  reserve tranche; and (ii) authorize drawings to meet demands for encashment of creditor claims under the New  Arrangements to Borrow (NAB) or the bilateral borrowing  agreements (see Note 14).  The IMF manages its liquidity risk by closely scrutinizing  developments in its liquidity position. The IMF’s main liquidity  measure—Forward Commitment Capacity -represents the  IMF’s capacity to make new GRA resources available to its  members over the following 12 months (see Schedule 2).   Long-term liquidity needs are addressed by reviewing the  adequacy of quota-based resources. General reviews of  members’ quotas are conducted at regular intervals to  evaluate the adequacy of quot a-based resources to meet  members’ demand for IMF financing. The IMF may also borrow to supplement its quota resources (see Note 14).  Short-term liquidity needs for financing activities are reviewed  and approved by the Executive Board on a periodic basis  through a financial transactions plan for quota resources and  the resource mobilization plan for borrowed resources.   4.2.3.1  Maturity profile of fi nancial assets and liabilities other  than investments  Depending on the type of financing instrument, repurchase  periods for GRA credit vary from 3¼ to 10 years. Scheduled  and overdue repurchases of outstanding GRA credit are  summarized below:      Repayments of outstanding borrowings are determined  according to the schedule of repurchases of credit that was  financed by borrowed resources. They also take into account  the maximum maturity of outstanding borrowings, which was  April 30, 2022  April 30, 2021   Financial year (in millions of SDRs )  2022 —  8,961  2023 19,198  19,777  2024 23,252  24,006  2025  18,497  18,183  2026 9,494  7,842  2027 6,446  3,692  2028 and beyond 16,144  7,185  Overdue —  142  Total 93,031  89,788  I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021    22 equal to 10 years for all outstanding borrowings. Scheduled  repayments of outstanding borrowings are summarized  below:    Repurchases during the financial years ended April 30, 2022,  and 2021, included advance repurchases of SDR 3,797 million and SDR 3,677 million, respectively.  These advance repurchases resulted in earlier than  scheduled repayments of outstanding borrowings of SDR 1,134 million and SDR 2,094 million, respectively.  Future interest payments on borrowings calculated at the  SDR interest rate at April 30, 2022, represent SDR 10 million for the financial year ending April 30, 2023. Thereafter, a total  of SDR 3 million will be paid th rough the last repayment date.  Usable and other currencies, SDR holdings, and quota subscriptions do not have maturity dates.  4.3  Investments  Investments are exposed to credit, market, and liquidity risks.  4.3.1  Credit risk on investments  Credit risk on investments repr esents the potential loss if  issuers and counterparties were to default on their  contractual obligations.   Credit risk in the IA is minimized by limiting fixed-income  investments to financial instrum ents with a credit rating at the  time of acquisition:   For the Fixed-Income Subaccount, effective January 12,  2022 the minimum credit rating is set at the equivalent of  BBB– (based on Standard & Poor’s long-term rating scale)  for corporate bonds and BBB+ for all other assets (at least A for all assets before January 12, 2022).    For the Endowment Subaccount, the minimum credit rating is set at BBB+ for so vereign bonds and BBB– for  corporate bonds and private infrastructure debt. Limited holdings in the Endowment Subaccount of corporate  bonds and private infrastructure debt rated below BBB–  are permitted under the Rules and Regulations of the  Investment Account.   Exempt from the credit rating requirement are instruments  issued by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS),  which does not have a credit ra ting, central bank deposits,  and short-term instruments.  The carrying amount of the fixed-income instruments represents the maximum exposure to credit risk. The credit  risk exposure for fixed-income instruments in the IA, at the  end of the respective reporting periods, was as follows:   Fixed-Income Subaccount    April 30, 2022 April 30, 2021  (as a percentage of total investments in  fixed-income instruments)   Not rated (BIS) — 0.0% 2,557 15.6%  AAA  5,422 29.3% 5,918 36.2%  AA+ to AA–  7,075 38.3% 3,435 21.0%  A+ to A  5,741 31.1% 4,305 26.4%  BBB+ 240 1.3% 125 0.8%  Total  18,478 100.0% 16,340 100.0%      Counterparty risk for derivative instruments is mitigated by strict exposure limits, cr edit rating requirements, and  collateral requirements. The ma ximum exposure to credit risk  for derivative instruments is the amount of any unrealized  gains on such contracts.   The credit risk exposure for derivative instruments in the  Fixed-Income Subaccount amounted to SDR 106 million and  SDR 38 million at April 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The  credit risk exposure for derivative instruments in the Endowment Subaccount amounted to SDR 58 million and  SDR 5 million at April 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively.  4.3.2  Market risk on investments  Market risk is the risk that the fa ir value or future cash flows  of financial instruments will fl uctuate because of changes in  market prices. Market risk for investments incl udes interest  rate risk, exchange rate risk, and other price risks.  The investment objectives of the Fixed-Income and  Endowment Subaccounts differ, and the investment  strategies, including asset allocation and risk tolerance, are  tailored for each of the subacc ounts, thereby exposing them  to different types of market risk.

General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021     23 4.3.2.1  Fixed-Income Subaccount  The Fixed-Income Subaccount holds debt obligations of a  broad range of issuers within limits defined by the Rules and  Regulations of the IA (see Note 7.1 for the eligible investments). Market risk is mitigated through asset class  diversification and within asset classes through broad security selection.   The Fixed-Income Subaccount authorizes the use of  derivative instruments for managing interest rate risk, currency hedging, or reducing co sts in the context of portfolio  balancing, benchmark replication, and market access. Safeguards are in place against short selling and financial leverage.  Exchange rate risk is mitigated by hedging investments  denominated in non-SDR currencies into SDR basket currencies with the objective of preserving the Fixed-Income  Subaccount’s SDR basket composition.  4.3.2.2  Endowment Subaccount   Investments are divided into eight categories, which are  subject to varying market risks and benefits from  diversification properties (see  Note 7.2 for the eligible  investments). Market risk is mitigated through asset class  diversification and within asset classes through broad security selection.   Effective January 12, 2022, except for the allocation to  emerging market equities, which may be managed actively, all Endowment Subaccount assets shall be managed  passively (prior to January 12, 2022, the Endowment  Subaccount was split into the passively-managed portfolio managed in accordance with the strategic asset allocation  and the actively-managed portfolio, which could comprise up  to 10 percent of the Endowment assets, invested in the same  asset categories with target  shares for fixed-income  instruments and equities with out specific allocation  requirements within those shares).   The Endowment Subaccount authorizes the use of derivative  instruments for managing interest rate risk, currency hedging, or reducing costs in the cont ext of portfolio balancing,  benchmark replication, and market access.   Because the IMF’s administrative expenditures are largely in  US dollars and the Endowment Subaccount’s general  objective is to contribute to  covering such expenditures (see  Note 1.2), the performance of the Endowment Subaccount is  measured in US dollars as the base currency but translated into SDRs for financial reporting. The Rules and Regulations  of the IA provide for hedging against the exchange rate risk  for fixed-income instruments denominated in developed  market currencies vis-à-vis the US dollar. The valuation changes from exchange rate fluctuations are included in the determination of investment income.   4.3.2.3  Value at risk  Exposures to market risk, including interest rate, exchange rate, and other price risks, are measured using VaR, which  considers known market risks in each of the asset categories  and the effect of asset class diversification. VaR estimates  reported below represent the maximum potential loss in  value of the assets over the ne xt year due to adverse market  movements with a 95 percent c onfidence level. There is a  1 in 20 chance that annual losses on investment assets are equal to or exceed the reported VaR. Losses in a single year could exceed the reported VaR by a significant amount.  The VaR model is based on historical simulations with a  three-year look back period and monthly overlapping risk factor returns for each individual instrument in the portfolios  to produce plausible future scenarios based on these  simulations. In each simulation scenario, risk factor data on the valuation date is shocked according to past observations  and each instrument is repriced, resulting in a hypothetical  empirical distribution of re turns. There is no standard  methodology for estimating VaR, and the modeling of the market risk characteristics of the investments involves many  assumptions and some limited pr oxy or substitutes. Different  assumptions or methodologies would produce significantly different VaR estimates.   The VaR for the Fixed-Income Subaccount portfolio was as  follows:   April 30, 2022 April 30, 2021   (in millions of SDRs )  Tranche 1 (see Note 7) 169 65  Tranche 2 (see Note 7) 107 58  Diversification effects (26) (47)  Total Fixed-Income Subaccount 250 76   I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021    24 The VaR for the Endowment Subaccount portfolio was as  follows:   April 30, 2022 April 30, 2021   (in millions of SDRs )  Passively managed portfolio:   Developed market equities 397 493  Emerging market equities 182 203  Global Sovereign bonds 66 —  Developed market sovereign bonds n/a1 65  Developed market corporate bonds 60 51  Emerging market bonds n/a1 17  US Treasury Inflation-Protected        Securities 68 52  Real estate investment trusts 175 97  Private infrastructure debt 17 5  Infrastructure equities 55 —  Diversification effects (296) (236)  Total for passively managed  portfolio 724 747  Actively managed portfolio:    Fixed-income securities — 10  Equity securities — 39  Diversification effects — (11)  Total for actively managed portfolio — 38  1 Following the changes to the investment  strategy approved by the Executive  Board on January 12, 2022, the investment categories of developed market  sovereign bonds and emerging market bonds were restructured into the global sovereign bonds category.     4.3.3  Liquidity risk on investments  Liquidity risk on investments refers to the risk that an investment will not have an active buyer or seller when  traded, which could negatively affect the price of the  investment.  The IA’s liquidity needs are low and the liquidity risk is  minimal because both subaccounts hold the majority of their resources in readily marketable short-term investments. 4.3.3.1  Maturity profile of investments The maturities of the fixed-income securities and derivatives  in the Fixed-Income Subaccount were as follows:     April 30, 2022 April 30, 2021  Financial year  (in millions of SDRs)   2022  — 6,909  2023 5,659 3,131  2024 5,294 2,179  2025  3,346 1,554  2026 2,110 1,254  2027 1,535 425  2028 and beyond 891 1,154  Total 18,835 16,606   The maturities of the fixed-income securities and derivatives  in the Endowment Subaccount were as follows:   April 30, 2022 April 30, 2021  Financial year  (in millions of SDRs)   2022  — 392  2023 496 376  2024 344 396  2025  388 455  2026 390 461  2027 361 303  2028 and beyond 1,331 1,346  Total 3,310 3,729    Investments in both subaccounts largely represent liquid  investments, which could be sold earlier than their maturity,  whenever necessary.  4.4  Post-employment benefit plans  The General Department is exposed to investment, liquidity, and longevity risks associated wit h post-employment benefit  plans (the Plans). These risks are balanced a gainst the need  to meet the financial obligations of each plan. The Plans have adopted general guidelines on permissible investments and plan assets are invested a ccording to a strategic asset  allocation, which is expected to generate a rate of return at or in excess of the rate of growth in the Plans’ liabilities. The strategic asset allocation is reviewed periodically by the  Investment Committee. The strategic asset allocation is  designed to minimize the level of portfolio market risk  (volatility) for the targeted rate of return, while better aligning  portfolio volatility with the potential volatility of the Plans’  liabilities. Through a global, multiple-asset-class investment  approach, the portfolio risk is r educed for any targeted rate of  return, because asset class returns are not perfectly  correlated as regional and global economic, financial, and political events unfold. The Pl ans do not utilize specific,  targeted asset-liability matching  instruments or strategies I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021     25 such as annuities, longevity swaps, cash flow matching, or  duration matching.  The primary objective with respect to liquidity is to have  sufficient liquid resources available to pay benefits when due. This risk is monitored to ensure that payments due to the  participants and beneficiaries can be met from the holdings  of cash and highly liquid investments of the Plans.  4.5  Precautionary balances  Precautionary balances consist of the GRA reserves (excluding that portion repres enting the profits from the  2009–10 gold sales that have been earmarked for the  Endowment Subaccount), and t he balance in the SCA-1.  They are a key element of the Fund’s multilayered risk  management framework as they provide a buffer to protect  the Fund against unexpected losses resulting from credit,  income, and other financial risks. The Executive Board conducted an interim review of the adequacy of  precautionary balances in December 2021, ahead of the  standard two-year cycle given the need for close monitoring  due to the heightened uncertainty in the global economy  linked to the pandemic and the path and timing of the recovery. In concluding the interim review, the Executive  Board kept the medium-term indicative target and minimum  floor for precautionary balances at SDR 25 billion and SDR 15 billion, respectively (the medium-term indicative  target had been raised from SDR 20 billion to SDR 25 billion  during the previous review of the precautionary balances in November 2020).  During the December 2021 interim review, the Executive  Board approved a new approach for the treatment of retirement benefit plans in th e computation of precautionary  balances. This approach better reflects the role of precautionary balances as a long-term buffer for economic  and financial risks. Under the new approach, referred to as  the ‘economic basis’, the defined benefit liability of the plans  is measured using a discount rate that reflects the  expected  long-term return on plan assets. Any net liability measured under the economic basis is used in calculating precautionary balances in place of the net asset/liability  calculated under IAS 19 (see Note 11). However, any net  asset measured under the economic basis would not be used in calculating precautionary bala nces. The change took effect  from May 1, 2021. A one-time increase of SDR 205 million was made to precautionary ba lances as at that date,  reflecting the accumulated net loss to date, to align with the new measurement methodology.   At April 30, 2022, and 2021, precautionary balances  amounted to SDR 20.9 billion and SDR 20.0 billion,  respectively, and were calculated as follows:   April 30, 2022  April 30, 2021   (in millions of SDRs)  Special Reserve (Note 16)  13,692 11,347  General Reserve (Note 16) 12,832 12,003  Excluding profits from gold sales (4,403) (4,403)  Adjustment for net assets/liabilities under  retirement benefit plans under  IAS 19 (Note 11.2) (1,248) n/a  Adjustment for net liabilities  under retirement benefit plans  under the economic basis —1 n/a   SCA-1 (Note 13.2)   — 1,066  Total precautionary balances 20,873 20,013  1 The measurement of the retirement benefit plans under the economic basis  resulted in a net pension asset at April 30, 2022. As such, further adjustments to  precautionary balances were not required after excluding the net assets/liabilities determined under IAS 19.  5.  Currencies, including credit outstanding  Under the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, members are  required to maintain the value of the GRA’s holdings of their  currencies in terms of the SDR. Any depreciation or  appreciation in a member’s currency vis-à-vis the SDR gives  rise to a currency valuation adjustment receivable or payable that must be settled by the mem ber promptly after the end of  the financial year or at other times as requested by the IMF  or the member. Currency holdi ngs of SDR 454,718 million at  April 30, 2022, included receivables and payables arising  from those valuation adjustm ents of SDR 19,796 million and  SDR 13,073 million, respectively (currency holdings of  SDR 458,656 million at April 30, 2021, included receivables  and payables of SDR 25,618 million and SDR 10,182 million,  respectively).  All holdings of members’ currencies are typically revalued at  the IMF’s financial year-end.   5.1  Credit outstanding  At April 30, 2022, and 2021, members’ use of GRA credit  was represented by currency holdings of SDR 93,031 million  and SDR 89,788 million, respectively. I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021    26 Changes in credit outstanding under the various facilities of  the GRA were as follows:  1 Other facilities include legacy credit under Enlarged Access and Supplementary  Financing Facility.    1 Other facilities include legacy credit under Enlarged Access and Supplementary  Financing Facility.    5.1.1  Emergency financial assistance  The tables above reflect emergency financing under the RFI  that was provided by the General Department to members  facing urgent balance of payment s needs as a result of the  economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Credit  outstanding by member is presented in Schedule 1.  Following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the access  limits for RFI purchases were temporarily increased (see  Note 4.2.1).  5.1.2  Impairment analysis  The General Department has performed an impairment  analysis of credit outstanding  in accordance with its ECL  model (see Note 3.2.1.1). Based on this analysis, no loss  allowance was deemed to be necessary at April 30, 2022,  and 2021. As described in Note 3.2.1.1, the impairment analysis of the General Depa rtment’s credit outstanding  takes into account the unique  nature of the IMF’s financing  and its institutional status, and is performed holistically for  each debtor member based on  qualitative an d quantitative  considerations and taking into account relevant current developments, including the geopolitical and global economic developments as described in Note 1.5. In this context, the  results of the impairment ana lysis at April 30, 2022, and  2021, are not materially sensitive to reasonable changes in  input parameters of the ECL calculation.  5.2  Overdue obligations  At April 30, 2022, no member was six months or more overdue in settling its financial obligations to the General  Department (one member—Sudan—was six months or more  overdue in settling its financial obligations to the General Department at April 30, 2021).   On June 29, 2021, Sudan settled all of its overdue  obligations to the General Department, including GRA credit outstanding and overdue char ges of SDR 142 million and  SDR 738 million, respectively . Settlement of the overdue  charges generated burden-sharing refunds to members totaling SDR 611 million that had been previously collected  through burden-sharing adjustments to charges and  remuneration (see Notes 13.1, 13.2, 17, and 18).   6.  SDR holdings  The General Department can receive SDRs from members in  the settlement of their financia l obligations to the GRA and  quota subscription payments. In  addition, the GRA may use  or receive SDRs in transactions and operations with members, including the provision of financial assistance to  members, the receipt of charges and fees, and the payment of remuneration on reserve tranche positions or interest on  borrowings to member countries and lenders.  At April 30, 2022, and 2021, the SDR holdings of the General  Department amounted to SDR 22,270 million and  SDR 22,203 million, respectively.  The GRA earns interest on its SDR holdings at the same rate  as other holders of SDRs. Interest on SDR holdings during  the financial years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021, amounted to SDR 25 million and SDR 17 million,  respectively.  7.

General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021     27 During the financial year ended April 30, 2022,  SDR 2,393 million was transferred from the GRA to the IA, as  approved by the Executiv e Board (SDR 319 million  transferred from the IA to the GRA during the financial year  ended April 30, 2021).  On January 12, 2022, the Executive Board reviewed the  strategy of the Investm ent Account and approved  refinements to the investment strategies of the Fixed-Income Subaccount and the Endowment Subaccount, as reflected in Notes 1.2, 4.3.1, 4. 3.2, 7.1, and 7.2. Im plementation of these  changes has been initiated, but will be completed during the year ending April 30, 2023.  7.1  Fixed-Income Subaccount   The Fixed-Income Subaccount comprises two tranches, a  shorter-duration Tranche 1 and a longer-duration Tranche 2.  Effective January 12, 2022, the average duration of the  Fixed-Income Subaccount should not exceed three years  (prior to January 12, 2022, the Fixed-Income Subaccount  had an average duration limit of two and a half years with  Tranche 1 managed against a zero- to three-year  government bond benchmark index and Tranche 2 against a zero- to five-year government bond benchmark index).  Tranche 1 is managed actively, while Tranche 2 is managed  according to a buy-and-hold investment approach, which in limited circumstances allows for the sale of investments in  accordance with the overall in vestment strategy prior to  maturity. Tranche 2 was phased in over a five-year period, which concluded in 2021. Prior to completion, assets pending  investment in Tranche 2 were placed in fixed term deposits.  Both tranches can be invested in debt obligations issued by  national governments of member s, their central banks and  official agencies, international financial institutions, and obligations of the BIS, denomi nated in SDRs or currencies  included in the SDR basket, referred to as Group 1 assets for investment management purposes . Eligible investments in  Tranche 1 also include fixed-income securities issued by  subnational governments, corporate bonds,  mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, and cash instruments with maturities  of one year or less, referred  to as Group 2 assets for investment management purposes. Assets are being invested by external managers, except for investments with the BIS and short-term investments  (residual cash balances). Effective January 12, 2022, Group 2 assets should not exceed 40 percent of the Fixed-Income  Subaccount portfolio (35 percent before January 12, 2022).

General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021    28 Fair values of derivative assets and liabilities in the  Fixed-Income Subaccount at April 30, 2022, were  SDR 106 million and SDR 77 million, respectively  (SDR 38 million and SDR 40 million for derivative assets and liabilities, respectively, at April 30, 2021). Notional values of  derivative instruments were as follows:  7.2  Endowment Subaccount   The assets of the Endowment Subaccount are invested in a  globally diversified portfolio consisting of fixed-income and equity instruments (including REITs), and private  infrastructure debt. Assets are invested by external  managers, except for short-term investments (residual cash balances).   The Endowment Subaccount is invested in accordance with  the strategic asset allocation in  select investment categories  approved by the Executive Board.  Each investment category  is invested to achieve exposure to broad characteristics of the specific asset class.   The refinements to the investm ent strategy approved by the  Executive Board on January 12, 2022, modified the strategic  asset allocation by reorganizing some investment categories  and shifting the allocations between the categories including:  (i) a reduction in the allocation to government bonds; (ii) a reduction in inflation-linked bonds; (iii) a dedicated allocation  to infrastructure equities; and (iv) an increase in REITS.  The strategic asset allocation includes a 5 percent allocation  to private infrastructure debt. The IMF invests in this asset  class through commingled funds and its commitments are  drawn down over time based on notices from the respective  investment managers. At Apr il 30, 2022 and April 30, 2021,  total original commitments amounted to SDR 171 million.  During the financial year ended April 30, 2022, total capital  calls under the commitments totaled SDR 96 million and  distributions amounting to SDR 1 million were paid back to the General Department (SDR 14 million and SDR 1 million  for capital calls and distributions, respectively, during the financial year ended April 30, 2021). Investments in the Endowment Subaccount, all of which are classified as FVPL, consisted of the following investment  categories:   April 30, 2022 April 30, 2021   (in millions of SDRs)   Passively managed portfolio:    Developed market sovereign bonds n/a1 894  Developed market corporate bonds 927 1,005  Emerging market bonds n/a1 274  Global sovereign bonds 971 —  US Treasury Inflation-Protected        Securities 969 1,214  Developed market equities 1,614 1,565  Emerging market equities 643 639  Infrastructure equities 340 —  Real estate investment trusts 676 347  Private infrastructure debt 97 12  Short-term investments 288 184  Total passively managed portfolio  6,525 6,134  Actively managed portfolio:    Fixed-income securities — 143  Equity securities — 134  Short-term investments — 10  Total actively managed portfolio — 287  Derivative assets  58 5  Total 6,583 6,426  1 Following the changes to the investment  strategy approved by the Executive  Board on January 12, 2022, the investment categories of developed market  sovereign bonds and emerging market bonds were restructured into the global sovereign bonds category.     Investment categories comprise funds managed to achieve  exposure to broad characteristics of the specific asset class.  Funds may include holdings in other asset classes. Market  exposure may be achieved throug h derivative instruments,  where necessary and as determined under the IA’s Rules  and Regulations.  Fair values of derivative assets and liabilities in the  Endowment Subaccount at April 30, 2022, were SDR 58 million and SDR 15 million, respectively  (SDR 5 million and SDR 16 million for derivative assets and liabilities, respectively, at April 30, 2021).

Fair value measurement   Valuation techniques used to value financial instruments  include the following:  Level 1  The fair value of publicly tr aded investments is based on  quoted market prices in an active market for identical assets  without any adjustments (clo sing price for equities and  derivative instruments and bi d price for fixed-income  securities). These investments are included within Level 1 of  the fair value hierarchy.   Level 2 The fair value of equity and fixed-income securities not actively traded is determined on the basis of a compilation of  significant observable market information, such  as recently  executed trades in securities of the issuer or comparable  issuers and yield curves. The assessment also takes into  account the inherent risk and terms and conditions of each security. Given that the significant inputs are observable,  these securities are included wit hin Level 2 of the fair value  hierarchy.   The fair value of over-the-c ounter derivative instruments  (foreign exchange forwards, curr ency/interest rate swaps) not  actively traded is determined using a pricing model that  incorporates foreign exchange spot and forward rates and interest rate curves. Given that  the significant inputs into the  pricing models are market obser vable, these instruments are  included within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.  Level 3  The private infrastructure debt assets classified within Level  3 have significant unobserva ble inputs, as they trade  infrequently or do not trade at all. As observable prices are  not available for these assets, the mark-to-model valuation  technique is used to derive the fair value. Different assumptions or approximations could produce significantly  different valuation estimates.   8.1  Investments   The following tables present the fair value hierarchy used to  determine the fair value of investments in the IA:   April 30, 2022   Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total  (in millions of SDRs)   Recurring fair value measurements    Fixed-Income Subaccount 133 18,702 — 18,835  Endowment Subaccount 3,270 3,216 97 6,583  Total 3,403 21,918 97 25,418     April 30, 2021   Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total  (in millions of SDRs)   Recurring fair value measurements    Fixed-Income Subaccount 194 15,661 — 15,855  Endowment Subaccount 2,707 3,707 12 6,426  Total 2,901 19,368 12 22,281    During the financial year ended April 30, 2022, investments totaling SDR 11 million in the Endowment Subaccount were transferred from Level 1 to Level 2 (there were no transfers  from Level 1 to Level 2 in the Fixed-Income Subaccount).  These investments relate to equity securities where trading was either inactive or quoted prices in the applicable market  were not observable as at April 30, 2022. Quoted prices for  similar securities directly observable in an alternative market  were used for fair value measurement of these securities as  at April 30, 2022. During the financial year ended April 30, 2021, there were no transfers from level 1 to level 2 in both  the Fixed-Income and Endowment Subaccounts.    There were no transfers between levels 2 and 3 of fair value  hierarchy in both the Fixed-Income and Endowment  Subaccounts during the financial years ended April 30, 2022,  and 2021. I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021    30 Fixed-term deposits in the IA are generally of a short-term  nature and are carried at amorti zed cost, which approximates  fair value.  Derivative liabilities at April 30, 2022 comprised  SDR 16 million valued based on quoted market prices  (Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy) and SDR 76 million  valued based on observable market data (Level 2 in the fair  value hierarchy) (SDR 8 million and SDR 48 million for  Level 1 and Level 2, respectively, at April 30, 2021).  8.2  Credit outstanding   The IMF plays a unique role in providing balance of  payments support to member countries. IMF financing  features policy conditions that  require member countries to  implement macroeconomic and structural policies and are an  integral part of IMF financing. These measures aim to help  countries resolve their balanc e of payments problems while  safeguarding IMF resources. The fair value of IMF credit  outstanding cannot be deter mined due to its unique  characteristics, including the debtor’s membership relationship with the IMF, and the absence of a principal or  most advantageous market for IMF credit.   8.3  Other financial assets and liabilities   The carrying value of other financial assets and liabilities that  are classified at AC represents a reasonable estimate of their  fair value at April 30, 2022, and 2021.  9.  Gold holdings   The IMF acquired its gold holdings from quota subscriptions and financial transactions prior to the entry into force of the  Second Amendment of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement  (April 1, 1978). At April 30,  2022, and 2021, the IMF held  gold of 2,814 metric tons, equal to 90.474 million fine troy ounces, at designated depositories. Gold holdings were valued at a historical cost of SDR 3,167 million at April 30,  2022, and 2021, based on a cost of SDR 35 per fine troy ounce.  At April 30, 2022, the market value of the IMF’s holdings of  gold was SDR 128.6 billion (SDR 111.4 billion at  April 30, 2021).   10.  Property, plant and equipment and intangible  assets  Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, net of  depreciation and amortization, amounted to SDR 551 million and SDR 555 million at April 30, 2022, and 2021,  respectively, and consisted of land, buildings, equipment,  furniture, and software.   Land Buildings Other Total   (in millions of SDRs)   Financial year ended April 30, 2022:    Cost          Beginning of the year 95 437 420 952          Additions — 2 46 48          Disposals — — (16) (16)      End of the year 95 439 450 984  Accumulated depreciation and amortization:      Beginning of the year — 175 222 397        Depreciation and amortization — 12 40 52        Disposals — — (16) (16)      End of the year — 187 246 433  Net book value at April 30, 2022 95 252 204 551      Depreciation and amortization expenses of SDR 52 million  and SDR 49 million are included in administrative expenses  for the financial years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively.  11.  Employee benefits  11.1  Overview of the Plans  The IMF has a defined benefit Staff Retirement Plan (SRP) that covers all eligible staff and a Supplemental Retirement  Benefits Plan (SRBP) for a subset of participants of the SRP.  The SRBP provides for the payment of benefits that  otherwise would have been payable had the US qualified  plan benefits and compensation limits not applied. Participants in the SRP and SRBP (the pension plans) are  entitled to unreduced annual pensions beginning at the  normal retirement age of 62 or earlier if certain conditions of  age and service are met. The mandatory retirement age is  Land Buildings Other Total   (in millions of SDRs)  Financial year ended April 30, 2021:    Cost          Beginning of the year 95 436 401 932        Additions — 1 46 47        Disposals — — (27) (27)      End of the year 95 437 420 952  Accumulated depreciation and amortization:      Beginning of the year — 163 212 375        Depreciation and amortization — 12 37 49        Disposals — — (27) (27)      End of the year — 175 222 397  Net book value at April 30, 2021 95 262 198 555 I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021     31 65. The pension plans also provide an option for eligible staff  to receive reduced pension be nefits beginning at the age of  50. The level of pension benefits depends on the participants’ length of service and highest three-year average pensionable gross compensation. Participants may also elect upon  retirement to commute a portion of the lifetime pension  benefits into a lump-sum payment.  On June 3, 2021, the Executiv e Board approved changes to  the SRP and SRBP with an effect ive date of May 1, 2022, to  update the formula for the co mputation of the pensionable  gross compensation. The amount of past service cost  resulting from these changes recognized in the statement of income for the year ended April 30, 2022, amounted to  negative SDR 57 million.   The IMF provides other non-pension long-term benefits,  including medical insurance, life insurance, separation and  repatriation benefits, accrued annual leave, and associated  tax allowances. The IMF has established a separate account, the Retired Staff Benefits Investment Account (RSBIA), to  hold and invest resources set asid e to fund the cost of certain  post-retirement benefits.   In May 2020, the Executive Board approved changes to  separation and repatriation benef its with an effective date of  October 1, 2020. The past servic e cost resulting from these  changes recognized in the stat ement of income for the year  ended April 30, 2021, amounted to SDR 6 million. In April 2022, the Executive Board ap proved changes to medical  benefits covered by the RSBI A with an effective date of  January 1, 2023. The past service cost resulting from these changes recognized in the stat ement of income for the year  ended April 30, 2022 was a gain of SDR 112 million.  The assets in the SRP, SRBP, and RSBIA (collectively, the  Plans) are held separately from  the assets of all other  accounts of the IMF. Also, the net asset position in one of the  Plans cannot be netted with the net liability position in  another Plan. In the event the IMF were to exercise its right  to terminate the Plans, the assets of these plans would be used to satisfy liabilities to par ticipants, retired participants,  and their beneficiaries and other liabilities of the pension plans. Any remaining assets would be returned to the GRA. The GRA meets the costs of administering the Plans, and the  SRP and RSBIA reimburse the GRA for investment-related  costs.   The Executive Board and t he Pension Committee are  responsible for the governance of the Plans. The Executive  Board approves the funding framework and amendments to  the Plans. The Pension Committ ee, consisting of members of  the Executive Board a nd senior staff, super vises and controls  the overall administration of  the SRP and the SRBP. The  Pension Committee also undert akes periodic valuations of the assets and liabilities related to the Plans and advises the  Executive Board on the appropri ate funding framework. It is  supported by an Investment Committee to oversee the investments of the Plans.  11.2  Net assets/liabilities and benefit costs under  retirement benefit plans  The amounts recognized in the statements of financial  position were as follows:   April 30, 2022 April 30,  2021   Pension  benefits Other  employee  benefits Total   Total    (in millions of SDRs)   Defined benefit  obligation (8,610) (1,856) (10,466) (11,425)  Plan assets 9,404 2,310 11,714 11,220  Net assets 794 581 1,375 —  Net liabilities  — (127) (127) (205)    The amounts recognized in the statements of income and  statements of comprehensive income were as follows:   2022 2021   Pension  benefits Other  employee  benefits Total Total    (in millions of SDRs)   Service cost (262) (105) (367) (407)  Past service cost 57 112 169 (6)  Interest expense related to  defined benefit obligation (280) (71) (351) (335)  Interest income related to plan assets 271 65 336 244  Net periodic pension cost  recognized in the statements of income (214) 1 (213) (504)  Remeasurement of defined benefit obligation 1,405 630 2,035 457  Net return on plan assets excluding amounts included in interest income (393) (94) (487) 2,532  Exchange differences (19) (14) (33) 166  Amounts recognized in other comprehensive income 993 522 1,515 3,155  Total gain recognized in  statements of  comprehensive income 779 523 1,302 2,651   I.

The actuarially  determined employer contributions to the pension plans  during the financial year ended April 30, 2022 amounted to 10.66 percent of pensionable gross compensation  (13.06 percent of pensionable gross compensation during the  financial year ended April 30, 2021). Under the IMF’s funding  framework, the budgetary allocations for payments to the  pension plans have been set at 14 percent of pensionable gross compensation. The IMF expects to contribute  SDR 150 million to the Plans during the financial year ending  April 30, 2023.  The expected pension and benefits payments to be paid out  by the Plans over the next five years were as follows at  April 30, 2022:  Financial year  Pension  benefits  Other  employee  benefits Total  (in millions of SDRs)  2023 332 85 417  2024 348 70 418  2025 368 74 442  2026 385 76 461  2027 401 79 480  11.3  Principal actuarial assumptions  The IMF conducts a comprehensive analysis of the principal actuarial assumptions used in calculating the net assets/liabilities under retirement benefit plans every five  years and reviews their applicability on an annual basis. The  most recent five-year analysis was completed in April 2021.   The principal actuarial assumptions used in the actuarial  valuation were as follows:   April 30, 2022  April 30, 2021   (in percent)   Discount rate/expected return on  plan assets 4.18 3.02  Rate of salary increases (average)  3.50  Health care cost trend rate  4.00–6.50 4.00–6.75  Inflation  2.00  Life expectancy: (in years)  Male  89.6 89.5  Female  93.0 92.9    The assumed retirement rate ranges from 5 percent at age  50 to 100 percent at age 65, and the assumed participation  rate for medical benefits upon retirement is 85 percent.

Burden-sharing and the Special Contingent  Account  13.1  Burden-sharing for deferred charges   The IMF has adopted a burden-sharing mechanism to  address the financial consequences of member countries’  failure to settle financial obligations to the GRA on time.  Under the burden-sharing mechanism, resources are generated by increasing the rate of charge paid by borrowers  and reducing the rate of remuneration paid to creditor  members to cover shortfalls in the GRA’s income due to the  nonpayment of charges.   Members that participated in  burden-sharing for overdue  charges receive refunds to the extent that t hese charges are  subsequently settled by the defaulting member. During the financial year ended April 30, 2022, the General  Department refunded the full amount of remaining burden- sharing adjustments amounting to SDR 611 million resulting  from the settlement of all outstanding overdue GRA charges  previously deferred (see Note 5.2). There were no deferred charges at April 30, 2022.  There were no burden-sharing refunds during the financial  year ended April 30, 2021. Overdue charges that resulted in  adjustments to charges and remuneration for the year ended  April 30, 2021, amounted to SDR 2 million (see Note 17). Cumulative overdue charges that resulted in adjustments to  charges and remuneration since May 1, 1986 (the date the  burden-sharing mechanism was adopted) amounted to SDR 2,051 million at April 30, 2021. The cumulative refunds  for the same period, resulting from the settlements of  overdue charges for which burden-sharing adjustments had  been made, amounted to SDR 1,440 million at  April 30, 2021.   13.2  Burden-sharing for the SCA-1  The burden-sharing mechanism has also financed additions  to the SCA-1, which offers protection against the risk of loss  resulting from the ultimate failure of a member to repay its overdue obligations to the GRA.   Contributions to the SCA-1 are to be returned when there are  no outstanding overdue repurchases and charges, or at such earlier time as the Executive Board may decide.  During the financial year ended April 30, 2022, in connection  with the clearance of Sudan’ s arrears to the IMF, the  Executive Board decided to make a distribution of the remaining SDR 1,066 million in the SCA-1 to contributing members. The distribution took place on June 29, 2021, and  the SCA-1 balance amounted to zero at April 30, 2022  (SDR 1,066 million at April 30, 2021). I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021    34 Effective November 1, 2006, t he Executive Board decided to  suspend, for the time being, further additions to the SCA-1.  Accordingly, no additions have been made to the SCA-1  during the financial years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021.   14.  Borrowings  The GRA can borrow to temporarily supplement its quota  resources. The Executive Boar d has established guidelines  on borrowing by the GRA to ensur e that the financing of the  GRA is managed in a prudent and systemic manner.   The GRA’s main standing borrowing arrangement is the  NAB. The GRA may also borrow under bilateral agreements, in particular loan and note purchase agreements (bilateral  borrowing agreements). At April 30, 2022, the NAB credit  arrangements amounted to SDR 360.8 billion and the bilateral borrowing agreements amounted to  SDR 138.1 billion; see Schedules 4 and 5, respectively.  14.1  New Arrangements to Borrow   The NAB is a standing set of credit arrangements with 40 participants, of which 38 ag reements were effective at  April 30, 2022, and 2021. The NAB provides supplementary  resources to the GRA as a second line of defense to IMF  quotas.   NAB periods are renewed periodically. In January 2020, the  Executive Board approved a NAB reform that doubled NAB  commitments and set a new NAB period through end 2025.  NAB participants have since provided the necessary consents and this reform took effect as targeted on January  1, 2021. Following the effect iveness of the reform, the  effective NAB commitments amounted to 360.8 billion at April 30, 2022, and 2021.  NAB resources can be activated when the Fund’s resources  need to be supplemented in order to forestall or cope with an  impairment of the internat ional monetary system. The  activation requires the consent of participants representing  85 percent of total NAB credit  arrangements of participants  eligible to vote and the approval  of the Executive Board. The  NAB was not activated at April 30, 2022, and 2021.  Drawings under the NAB can be made to finance purchases  by borrowing members for outright purchases and under  arrangements that were approved during the period when the NAB was activated. Claims under the NAB are encashable  on demand by participants, subject to certain conditions.  14.2  Bilateral Borrowing Agreements   Bilateral borrowing agreements are intended to serve as a third line of defense to IMF quotas and NAB resources. The  current round of bilateral borrowing agreements, which have been in effect since January 1, 2021, were signed under a framework established by the Executive Board in 2020. They  have an initial term through end-December 2023, which may  be extended by one more year, subject to creditor consent.   At April 30, 2022, lenders’  commitments under effective  borrowing agreements totaled US$185.6 billion, equivalent to  SDR 138.1 billion (US$193.9 billion equivalent to  SDR 135.0 billion at April 30, 2021).   Resources under bilateral borrowing agreements can be  activated only if the amount  of IMF resources otherwise  available for financing has fallen below a threshold of SDR 100 billion and either the NAB is activated or there are no available uncommitted NAB resources. Activation requires  approval by bilateral creditors r epresenting 85 percent of the  total credit amount committed.   Drawings under the borrowing agreements may be made to  finance purchases by borrowing members for outright  purchases and under arrangements that were approved during the period when the borrowing agreements were  activated. Claims under the bilateral borrowing agreements  are encashable on demand by lenders, subject to certain conditions.  14.3  Outstanding borrowings  Outstanding borrowings represent  drawings under the NAB,  are denominated in SDRs, and carry the SDR interest rate. There were no outstanding borrowings under bilateral  borrowing agreements at April 30, 2022, and 2021.  There were no drawings under the NAB or bilateral  borrowings during the financial years ended April 30, 2022,  and 2021. Repayments under the NAB during the same periods amounted to SDR 2,523 million and  SDR 3,765 million, respectively. Total outstanding NAB  borrowings at April 30, 2022, and 2021, were SDR 2,615  million and SDR 5,138 million, respectively (see Schedule 4).   The average interest rate on outstanding borrowings was  0.107 percent per annum and 0.077 percent per annum for  the financial years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021,  respectively.  The interest expense on outstanding borrowings  during the same periods was SDR 4 million and  SDR 6 million, respectively.  15.  Quota subscriptions and reserve tranche  positions  15.1  Quota subscriptions  The IMF’s resources are primarily provided by its members  through the payment of quota subscriptions, which broadly I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021     35 reflect each member’s relative position in the global  economy. Quotas also determine each member’s relative  voting power, its share in SDR allocations, and its access to  IMF resources.   The IMF conducts a general review of members’ quotas at  intervals of not more than five years. The review allows the  IMF to assess the adequacy of quota resources to meet its  needs and to allow for adjustments to members’ quotas to  reflect their relative positions in the world economy.   The Fourteenth General Review of Quotas became effective  in January 2016. At April 30, 2022, 187 members had  consented and paid in full their quota increases, amounting to SDR 238 billion (184 members at April 30, 2021,  amounting to SDR 238 billion) . This amount represents over  99 percent of the total quota increases that members were  eligible for at January 26, 2016 (SDR 239 billion). Quota subscription payments under the Fourteenth General Review  of Quotas during the years e nded April 30, 2022, and 2021,  amounted to SDR 0.5 billion and SDR 2 million, respectively.  The Fifteenth General Review of  Quotas was concluded in  February 2020 with no increase in IMF quotas. The Sixteenth  Review is planned to be concluded no later than  December 15, 2023.  On October 16, 2020, the Princi pality of Andorra became the  190 th member of the IMF wit h an initial quota of  SDR 83 million, which was paid in full during the financial  year ended April 30, 2021.  15.2  Reserve tranche positions  The reserve tranche is determined as the difference between the member’s quota subscription and the GRA’s holdings of its currency, excluding holdings that reflect the member’s use  of GRA credit and administrative balances. A member’s  reserve tranche is also considered a part of its international  reserves and a liquid claim against the GRA that can be  encashed by the member at any time upon the representation of a balance of payments need.    Members’ reserve tranche positions were as follows:    April 30, 2022 April 30, 2021   (in millions of SDRs )  Quota subscriptions 476,272 475,808  Total currency holdings 454,718 458,656  Less: GRA credit outstanding (93,031) (89,788)  Less: administrative balances (161) (167)   361,526 368,701  Reserve tranche positions 114,746 107,107  16.  Reserves of the General Resources Account  16.1  Reserves of the General Resources Account  The GRA reserves consist of the Special Reserve and the  General Reserve. The General Reserve may be used inter  alia to meet capital losses and operational deficits or for  distribution to IMF members. The Special Reserve can be  used for the same purposes except distribution to members. At April 30, 2022, the balanc es of Special and General  Reserves amounted to SDR 13,692 million and SDR 12,832 million, respectively (SDR 11,347 million and SDR 12,003 million, respectively, at April 30, 2021).   16.2  Income disposition  The Executive Board determines annually what part of the GRA net income (as described below) will be placed to the General Reserve and/or the Special Reserve, and what part,  if any, will be distributed. Net losses are charged against the  Special Reserve in accordance with an Executive Board  decision.   The GRA net income/losses for the purpose of the income  disposition includes: (i) total income of the GRA; (ii) transfer  from the IA as approved by the Executive Board; and (iii) the  remeasurement of net assets/ liabilities under retirement  benefit plans. For the financia l years ended April 30, 2022,  and 2021, the Executive Board decided to place income to/charge losses against reserves as follows:   Special Reserve  General Reserve    Income Remea- surement Total Income Remea- suremen tTotal    (in millions of SDRs)  Balance at      April 30, 2021 10,842 505 11,347 10, 983 1,020 12,003  Income of the  GRA 830 — 830 829 — 829  Transfer from the IA — — — — — —  Remeasurement of net assets/liabilities  under retirement  benefit plans — 1,515 1,515 — — —  Balance at    April 30, 2022 11,672 2,020 13,692 11,812 1,020 12,832   I.

Charges and fees   The average credit outstanding subject to charges amounted  to SDR 90,522 million and SDR 86,700 million for the financial years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively.   The rate of charge levied on outstanding credit is equal to the  basic rate of charge adjusted for burden-sharing (see  Note 13). The basic rate of charge is the SDR interest rate  plus a fixed margin as determined by the Executive Board, which for the years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021,  amounted to 100 basis points. The average rate of charge  (adjusted for burden-sharing) was 1.107 percent per annum  and 1.077 percent per annum for the financial years ended  April 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively.  Credit outstanding in excess of 187.5 percent of quota  resulting from purchases in the credit tranches and under the  EFF and the SLL is subject to a level-based surcharge of  200 basis points per annum above the basic rate of charge.  An additional time-based surcharge of 100 basis points per  annum applies to such credit outstanding for more than three years, except for purchases under the EFF, for which the  additional surcharge of 100 basis points applies after 51 months. Purchases under the SLL are not subject to time-based surcharges given the short maturity of repurchase  obligations.  Charges income consisted of the following:    During the year ended April 30, 2022, the IMF did not have  overdue charges to defer. The deferred charges during the  year ended April 30, 2021, amounted to SDR 2 million (see  Note 13.1) and were fully recovered through the proceeds from burden-sharing adjustments to charges and  remuneration of SDR 1 million each (see also Note 18).   Other charges and fees cons isted of the following:   2022  2021   (in millions of SDRs)  Service charges  71 115  Commitment fee 283 70  Special charges 88 —  Total charges  442 185    A service charge of 50 basis points is levied by the GRA on  all purchases from the GRA, except for purchases under SLL arrangements, which are subject to a service charge of  21 basis points, and reserve tranche purchases, which are  not subject to service charges.   A commitment fee is levied on the amount available for  financing under an arrangement for each 12-month period  and refunded as the member makes purchases under the  arrangement. Except for SLL arrangements, the commitment  fee amounts to 15 basis points per annum for access up to 115 percent of quota, 30 basis points for access between  115 and 575 percent of quota, and 60 basis points for access  in excess of 575 percent of quota. For SLL arrangements,  the commitment fee amounts to 8 basis points and is not  refundable when the member makes purchases under the  arrangement. At the expiration or cancellation of a GRA arrangement any unrefunded amount is recognized as  income, except for SLL arrangements for which commitment  fee income is recognized on a straight-line basis during the  duration of the arrangement.  The GRA levies special charges on overdue repurchases  and charges of less than six mont hs’ duration. Currently, the  special rate of charge on overdue repurchases is set at zero and for overdue charges it is equal to the SDR interest rate. Such charges are deferred when not paid and recognized as  2022  2021   (in millions of SDRs)  Basic charges before burden-sharing adjustment  1,043 930  Deferred basic charges recovered through:    Burden-sharing adjustment to charges — 1  Burden-sharing adjustment to remuneration  — 1  Surcharges  1,234 931  Total charges  2,277 1,863",6

Financial Statements of the General Department    PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, 655 New York Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20001   T: (202) 414 1000, www.pwc.com/us       Report of Independent Auditors     To the  Board of Governors of the International Monetary Fund     Opinion     We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the General Department of the International  Monetary Fund (the “Department”), which comprise the  statements of financial position as of April 30,  2022 and 2021, and the related statements of income, of comprehensive income, of changes in reserves,  retained earnings, and resources, and of cash flows for the years then ended , including the related notes  (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”).     In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial  position of the Department as of April 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash  flows for the years then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued  by the International Accounting Standards Board.     Basis for Opinion     We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of  America (US GAAS) and in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our  responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibil ities for the Audit  of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of the International  Monetary Fund, and have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant  ethical requirements relatin g to our audit,  which include relevant ethical requirements in the United  States of America and the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for  Professional Accountants . We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and  appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.     Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial  Statements     Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the fina ncial statements in  accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting  Standards Board, and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the  preparation and fair presenta tion of financial statements that are free from material misstatement,  whether due to fraud or error.     In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Department’s ability to  continue as a going concern for at least, but not limited to, twelve months from the end of the reporting  period , disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of  accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Department or to cease operati ons, or has  no realistic alternative but to do so.           Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Department’s financial reporting  process.     Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements       Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are  free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that  includes our opinion . Reasonable assurance is a high l evel of assurance but is not absolute assurance and  therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with US GAAS and ISAs  will always  detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement result ing  from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional  omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material  if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment  made by a reasonable user based on the financial statements.     In performing an audit in accordance with US GAAS and ISAs we:    ● Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.   ● Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to  fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such  procedures include exam ining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in  the financial statements.   ● Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit  procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for  the purpose of expressing an  opinion on the effectiveness of the Department’s internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is  expressed.    ● Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant  accounting estimate s made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the  financial statements.   ● Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate,  that raise substantial doubt about the Department’s ability to c ontinue as a going concern for a  reasonable period of time.     We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the  planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal contr ol-related  matters that we identified during the audit.    Supplemental Information     Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the financial statements taken as a  whole. The accompanying supplemental schedules appearing on pages 40 to 48 as of April 30, 2022 and  for the years ended April 30, 2022 and 2021 (collectively referred to as the “supplemental schedules”) are  presented for purposes of additional analysis and are not a required part of the financial statements. The  supplemental s chedules are the responsibility of management and were derived from and relate directly to  the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the financial statements. The information  has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the au dit of the financial statements and certain  additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying  accounting and other records used to prepare the financial statements or to the financial statements     themselv es and other additional procedures, in accordance with US GAAS. We also subjected the  information to the applicable procedures required by ISAs. In our opinion, the supplemental schedules are  fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the fina ncial statements taken as a whole.         June 24, 2022       I.

General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021    11 Notes to the Financial Statement s for the Financial Years Ended  April 30, 2022, and 2021        1.  Nature of operations  The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is an international  organization with 190 member countries. The IMF’s  fundamental mission is to en sure the stability of the  international monetary system. It does so in three ways:  surveillance of the global economy and the economies of  member countries; lending to  countries with balance of  payments difficulties; and giving practical help by providing technical assistance to members. It is headquartered in Washington, DC, USA.   The IMF conducts its operations and transactions through the  General Department. The General Department comprises three accounts: (i) the General  Resources Account (GRA);  (ii) the Investment Account (IA); and (iii) the Special Disbursement Account (SDA).  1.1  General Resources Account  The financial operations of the IMF with its members are  primarily conducted through the GRA. The assets and liabilities in the GRA reflect the payment of member quota  subscriptions, use and repayment of GRA credit, borrowings  and repayments to lenders, collection of charges from borrowers, payment of remuneration on creditor positions  and interest to lenders, and other operations.  A core responsibility of the IMF is to provide financial  assistance to member countries experiencing actual or  potential balance of payments pr oblems. Upon the request of  a member country, GRA resources are made available either  under a financing arrangement or in the form of outright  purchases (disbursements). An arrangement is a decision by  the IMF’s Executive Board (Executive Board) that gives a  member the assurance that the IMF stands ready to provide  resources to the member during a specified period and up to a specified amount, in accordance with the terms of the  relevant financing instrument.   The Stand-By Arrangement (SBA)  is designed for members  with balance of payments problems expected to be resolved  in the short to medium term. The Extended Fund Facility  (EFF) is a special facility in the GRA for members with longer-term balance of payments problems, the resolution of  which would require structural and more comprehensive  economic reforms. Resources under the SBA and the EFF are made available in phased installments as the member  implements economic policies and measures specified under the arrangement, subject to periodic reviews by the  Executive Board.  The Flexible Credit Line (FCL) is available for members with  very strong fundamentals, policies, and track records of  policy implementation and is intended for both crisis prevention and resolution. The Short-term Liquidity Line  (SLL) is designed to provide liquidity support and has several  innovative features, including revolving access. It has the  same qualification criteria as the FCL but is available only for  members facing potential moderate short-term balance of  payments needs arising due to capital account pressures.  The Precautionary and Liquidity Line (PLL) is available for  members with sound economic fundamentals but with some remaining vulnerabilities that pr eclude them from meeting the  qualification criteria for the FCL and the SLL.   The financing instrument for outright purchases is the Rapid  Financing Instrument (RFI), which is used by members facing  an urgent balance of payments need without the necessity or  capacity for a full-fledged program.  1.2  Investment Account  The IA holds resources transferred from the GRA, which are  invested to broaden the IMF’s income base. The Rules and Regulations of the IA adopted  by the Executive Board  provide the framework for the implementation of the expanded investment authorit y authorized under the Fifth  Amendment of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, which  became effective in February 2011. The IA comprises two  subaccounts: the Fixed-Income Subaccount and the Endowment Subaccount.   The Fixed-Income Subaccount holds resources transferred  from the GRA that are not relat ed to profits from gold sales.  With a view to generating income while protecting the IMF’s  balance sheet, the investment objective of the Fixed-Income  Subaccount is to produce returns in Special Drawing Rights  (SDRs) terms in excess of the th ree-month SDR interest rate  (see Notes 2.1 and 2.2) over time while minimizing the  frequency and extent of negative returns and  underperformance over an investment horizon of three to  four years. During financial year ended April 30, 2022, the  Executive Board concluded its 5- yearly review of the Fixed- Income Subaccount’s investment strategy and effective January 12, 2022, set the investment objective to achieve, over time, returns that exceed  the SDR interest rate by a  margin of 50 basis points. I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021    12 The Endowment Subaccount was credited with  SDR 4.4 billion in profits fr om gold sales during financial  years 2010 and 2011. The Endowment Subaccount’s investment objective is to achieve a real return of 3 percent in US dollar terms over the long term to contribute to covering  the IMF’s administrative expenditures, while preserving the  long-term real value of these assets.   1.3  Special Disbursement Account  The SDA is the vehicle used to receive profits from the sale of gold held by the IMF at  the time of the Second  Amendment of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement (April 1978).  SDA resources can be used for various purposes, as  specified in the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, including transfers to the GRA for immediate use in operations and  transactions, transfers to the IA, or operations and  transactions that are not authorize d by other provisions of the  IMF’s Articles of Agreement but are consis tent with the  mandate of the IMF, in particular to provide balance of payments assistance on special terms to low-income  member countries.  1.4  Other entities administered by the IMF  The IMF also administers the Special Drawing Rights  Department (SDR Department ), trusts (Concessional  Lending and Debt Relief Trusts), and special purpose accounts (Administered Accounts) established to fund financial and technical services consistent with the IMF’s  purposes. As the General Department does not have control  over these entities, their finan cial statements are presented  separately.  The resources of the SDR Department are held separately  from the assets of all t he other accounts owned or  administered by the IMF. As specified in the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, these resources may not be used to meet the liabilities, obligations, or losses incurred in the operations of  the General Department (or vice versa), except that  expenses of conducting the business of the SDR Department are paid by the General De partment and are then reimbursed  by the SDR Department.   The resources of the trusts and special purpose accounts are  contributed by members, by other  financial institutions, or by  the IMF through the SDA. The a ssets and liabilities of the  trusts and special purpose accounts are separate from the assets and liabilities of the General Department. The assets  of the trusts and special purpose accounts cannot be used to  meet the liabilities, obligations, or losses incurred in the  operations of the General  Department. The General  Department can be reimbursed for the expenses incurred in  conducting the business of certain trusts and accounts in  accordance with the IMF’s Articles of Agreement and  relevant decisions of the Executive Board. 1.5  Impact of geopolitical and global economic  developments  The COVID-19 pandemic has cr eated severe disruptions in  global economic activity. The IMF responded to the crisis  with unprecedented speed and  magnitude of financial  assistance, to help countries, notably to protect the most vulnerable and set the stage for economic recovery. A significant number of countri es benefited from emergency  financing through RFI purchases during the financial year ended April 30, 2021 (see Note 5.1). The IMF has also approved financial assistance under its lending arrangements  and augmented existing lending arrangements to  accommodate new needs arising from the impact of the pandemic during the financial years ended April 30, 2022,  and 2021 (see Schedule 3). As a result of this increased  financing activity, the General Department’s credit exposure has increased compared with the pre-pandemic level.  The evolution of the pandemic is  still subject to significant  uncertainty. Beyond April 30, 2022, slowing global growth  and elevated debt vulnerabilities could lead to further  demand for lending arrangements in the coming months. The war in Ukraine that started in February 2022 is expected to  have a significant negative effect on global growth through  commodity markets, trade, and, to a lesser extent, financial interlinkages. Economic and financial spillovers from the war  could also trigger additional demand for Fund financing.   The General Department continues to manage its risks in  accordance with its existing risk management framework  (see Note 4). As of the date of  these financial statements,  there had been no negative impact on the operational results of the General Department, in cluding from the impairment  analysis of its credit portfolio (see Note 5.1). See also Note  2.3 for the most significant estimates and judgements used in  the preparation of thes e financial statements.  The risk management practices described in Note 4.3 have  effectively mitigated the risk exposure of the effects of the  global developments on the investment portfolios. The  valuations of mark-to-market  financial instruments had fully  and rapidly recovered after a brief decline in value at the  onset of the pandemic. However,  in light of the war in  Ukraine, tightening monetary c onditions coupled with a sharp  increase in inflation and inflat ion expectations, the investment  portfolios remain subject to challenging market conditions  and high volatility. The effects of the global developments on  investments are also reflected in the value at risk (VaR) (see  Note 4.3.2.3). The valuation of  investments held at amortized  cost was not impacted. I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021     13 2.  Basis of preparation and measurement  The financial statements of t he General Department are  prepared in accordance with International Financial  Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International  Accounting Standards B oard (IASB). The financial  statements have been prepared under the historical cost  convention, except for the revalu ation of financial instruments  at fair value through profit or  loss. The financial statements  have also been prepared on t he basis that the General  Department will continue to op erate as a going concern.  2.1  Unit of account  The financial statements are presented in SDRs, which is the  IMF’s unit of account. The value of the SDR is determined  daily by the IMF by summing specific amounts of the basket  currencies in US dollar equivalents on the basis of market exchange rates. The IMF generally reviews the composition  of the SDR valuation basket at  five-year intervals. These  reviews cover the currencies to be included in the SDR valuation basket (along with the criteria for the selection of  currencies), determine the relative weights of those  currencies, and assess the fi nancial instruments that are  used to calculate the SDR interest rate. The current basket consists of five currencies. The weights and amounts of the  currencies in the basket, at April 30, 2022, and April 30,  2021, relative to 1 SDR, were as follows:  SDR basket curren cy Weight (in percent) Amount  Chinese renminbi 10.92 1.0174  Euro 30.93 0.38671  Japanese yen 8.33 11.900  Pound sterling 8.09 0.085946  US dollar  41.73 0.58252    At April 30, 2022, SDR 1 was equal to US$1.34430  (US$1.43599 at April 30, 2021).  The current SDR valuation basket was originally scheduled  to expire on September 30, 2021. However, the Executive  Board decided to extend it to July 31, 2022.  On May 11, 2022, the Exec utive Board concluded the  quinquennial review of the me thod of valuation of the SDR  and agreed to maintain the curr ent composition of the SDR  currency and interest rate baskets and approved their  updated weights. The updated basket implies slightly higher weights for the US dollar and the Chinese renminbi and,  accordingly, somewhat lower we ights for the British pound,  the euro, and the Japanese yen.   Effective August 1, 2022, t he SDR basket valuation basket  will be assigned the following weights:  SDR basket currency Weight (in percent)  Chinese renminbi 12.28  Euro 29.31  Japanese yen 7.59  Pound sterling 7.44  US dollar  43.38    The amounts of each of the five  currencies will be calculated  on July 29, 2022 (the transition date) in accordance with the  new weights. The next review of the method of valuation of  the SDR will take place in 2027, unless developments in the  interim justify an earlier review.   2.2  SDR interest rate  The SDR interest rate provides the basis for basic charges  levied on credit outstanding (see Note 17), interest on SDR  holdings (see Note 6), remuneration paid on members’  reserve tranche positions (see Note 18), and interest on  borrowings (see Note 14).   The SDR interest rate is determined weekly by reference to a  weighted average of yields or rates on short-term instruments  in the money markets of the members whose currencies are  included in the SDR valuation basket:   SDR basket currency Yield or rate  Chinese renminbi Three-month benchmark yield for China  Treasury bonds as published by the China  Central Depository and Clearing Co., Ltd.  Euro Three-month spot rate for euro area central  government bonds with a minimum rating of  AA published by the European Central  Bank  Japanese yen Three-month Treasury discount bills  Pound sterling Three-month Treasury bills  US dollar Three-month Treasury bills    The SDR interest rate is subject to a floor of 0.050 percent  and is rounded to three decimal places.   The average SDR interest rate was 0.107 percent per annum  and 0.077 percent per annum during the financial years  ended April 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively.  2.3  Use of estimates and judgement  The preparation of financ ial statements requires  management to make judgements, estimates, and assumptions that affect the app lication of accounting policies  and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.  Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an  ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021    14 recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised  and in any future periods affected.  The most significant estimates and judgements used in  applying accounting policies include expected credit losses measurement for credit outstanding and undrawn  commitments (see Notes 3.2.1.1 and 5.1), fair value  measurement of financial inst ruments (see Notes 3.10 and  8), and actuarial assumptions used in calculating the net assets/liabilities under retirement benefit plans (see Note 11.3).  3.  Summary of significant accounting policies  3.1  Financial instruments   Financial instruments include financial assets and financial liabilities described in Notes 3.2 and 3.7.  Measurement at initial recognition  Financial instruments are recognized when the General Department becomes a party to the contractual provisions of  the instrument. The General Department uses settlement  date accounting for all financial instruments except for  investments, which are accounted for using trade date  accounting (see Note 3.2.3). At initial recognition, a financial instrument is measured at it s fair value, which is best  evidenced by the transaction amount.   Derecognition Financial assets, or a portion thereof, are derecognized when  the contractual rights to rece ive the cash flows from the  assets have expired, or when they have been transferred and  either: (i) the General Department  transfers substantially all  the risks and rewards of owners hip; or (ii) the General  Department neither transfers nor retains substantially all the  risks and rewards of ownership but the General Department  has not retained control.   Financial liabilities are derecognized when they are  extinguished (i.e., when the obligation is discharged,  canceled, or expires).   Classification and subsequent measurement of  financial assets  A financial asset is classified on initial recognition based on two factors: the business model for managing the financial  asset and its contractual cash flow characteristics.   Financial assets that are held for collection of contractual  cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and intere st are measured at amortized  cost (AC). Interest income fr om these financial assets is  included in the statements of  income using the effective interest method. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is  recognized in the statements of income.   Financial assets that are held for collection of contractual  cash flows and for selling, where the assets’ cash flows  represent solely payments of principal and interest, would be  measured at fair value through other comprehensive income  (FVOCI). The General Departm ent did not have financial  assets at FVOCI during the financial years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021.  All other financial assets that do not meet the criteria to be  measured at AC or FVOCI are measured at fair value, with  changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss (FVPL).  Impairment  At each reporting date, the General Department assesses on  a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses (ECL)  associated with its financial assets at AC and with the  undrawn balances under its lending commitments. The  measurement of ECL reflects: (i) an unbiased and probability-weighted amou nt that is determined by evaluating  a range of possible outcomes; (ii) the time value of money; and (iii) reasonable and suppor table information that is  available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date about past events, current conditions, and forecasts of future economic conditions.   If the General Department neede d to recognize ECL, they  would be recorded as impairment allowances for assets at AC and as a liability provision for undrawn commitments.   Should any financial asset become credit-impaired, interest  income would be calculated for it by applying the effective interest rate to its amortized co st (i.e., net of the impairment  allowance).  Classification and subsequent measurement of  financial liabilities  Derivative financial liabilities are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss.   All other financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost. Interest expense from these financial liabilities is included in the statements of income using t he effective interest method.   3.2  Financial assets  3.2.1  Currencies  Currencies are financial assets that consist of members’  currencies held by the GRA with designated depositories, in  the form of account balances or non-interest-bearing  promissory notes that ar e encashable by the GRA on  demand. All currencies in the GRA are classified at AC. I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021     15  Usable currencies are currencies of members considered  to be in a sufficiently strong external position that they can  be used to finance GRA transactions with other members.    Currencies of members that are not considered to have a  sufficiently strong balance of payments and reserves  position to finance GRA transactions with other members are presented as other currencies.    Holdings of member currencies that represent purchases of usable currencies or SDRs in exchange for their own  currencies are presented as credit outstanding (see Note  3.2.1.1).   The currency balances in the statements of financial position include receivables and payables arising from currency  revaluations (see Note 5).  3.2.1.1  Credit outstanding and charges  Credit outstanding is a financial asset that represents  financing provided to members under the various GRA financing facilities (see Note 1.1). Members receive financing  in the GRA by purchasing SDRs or usable currencies in  exchange for their own currencies. GRA credit is repaid by  members by repurchasing holdings of their currencies in  exchange for SDRs or usable currencies.   Charges and fees  The GRA earns interest, referred to as basic charges, on  members’ use of GRA credit (see Note 17). Basic charges are recognized using the e ffective interest method.    In addition to basic charges, outstanding GRA credit is also subject to level-based and time-based surcharges (see Note 17). Surcharges are recognized when the relevant  level-based and time-based thresholds on credit outstanding  set by the Executive Board are reached.   Charges not received from members within the required  timeframe are recovered by the GRA under the burden- sharing mechanism, through adjustments to increase the rate  of charge for debtor member s and decrease the rate of  remuneration on members’ reserve tranche positions (see  Note 13.1).   A service charge is levied by the GRA on all purchases from  the GRA except reserve tranche purchases. Service charges are paid when the purchases are made and are recognized  as income upon payment.   A commitment fee is levied on the amount available for  financing under an arrangement for each 12-month period of  the arrangement. Except for SLL arrangements, commitment  fees are refunded as the member makes purchases under  the relevant arrangement. A prorated commitment fee is also  refunded for all arrangements in case of an arrangement’s cancellation. At the arrangement’s expiration or cancellation, any unrefunded amount is recognized as income. Pending refund or recognition as income, commitment fees are  recognized as part of other li abilities in the statements of  financial position. For SLL arrangements, the commitment  fee is nonrefundable upon purchases. Accordingly,  commitment fee income is recognized on a straight-line basis  over the duration of the SLL arrangement.  Impairment of credit outstanding The General Department’s assessment for impairment of its credit outstanding is grounded in  the context of the nature of  the IMF’s financing and its un ique institutional status:     The IMF has a unique relationship with its member countries, all of which are shar eholders in the institution.    IMF financing under arrangements is linked to regular reviews of performance under a program of economic  policies that the member commits to in order to overcome  balance of payments problems, return to external viability, and repay the IMF.    The IMF employs a comprehensive set of measures to mitigate credit risk (see Note 4.2.1).   The IMF also has de facto pref erred creditor status, which  has been recognized by the official community and generally accepted by private creditors.  Taken together, these factor s significantly reduce the  likelihood of the General Department incurring credit losses.   The General Department has not recognized any impairment  losses since inception. Also, unlik e large financial institutions  in the private sector, the General Department’s credit portfolio consists of a relatively small number of exposures to  its member countries, with eac h member’s circumstances  varying. Therefore, a stat istical approach to credit risk  assessment, such as probability of default (PD) and loss given default (LGD) modeling, as typically followed in the financial sector is neither feasible nor appropriate for the  General Department.   Similarly, the assessment of t he General Department’s credit  risk cannot rely on external credit risk ratings. Due to its  unique characteristics, the IMF’ s credit risk exposure is not  comparable to sovereign credit risk faced by commercial  financial entities and, as a cooperative member organization,  the IMF does not produce its own internal credit rating  grades. Accordingly, credit risk for the General Department is  assessed holistically based on  qualitative an d quantitative  considerations pertaining to each debtor member, such as  the status of the economic programs underlying IMF  financing, the member’s cooperation on policy  implementation and timely settlement of IMF financial obligations, and forward-looking assessment of the member’s  capacity to repay. I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021    16 The General Department has developed a model for ECL  estimation based on changes in credit quality since initial  recognition, where credit qualit y is referred to as Stage 1,  Stage 2, and Stage 3. Credit out standing for which credit risk  has increased significantly since initial recognition (Stage 2), or that is credit-impaired (S tage 3), has its ECL measured on  a lifetime basis. Credit outstan ding for which there has been  no significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition  (Stage 1) has its ECL measured as a portion of lifetime ECL  that result from default events possible within the next  12 months.  The key judgements and assumptions adopted by the  General Department in t he measurement of ECL are  discussed below :  (i) Definition of defaul t and credit-impaired   The General Department considers a member country to be  in default when it is six months or more overdue in settling its  financial obligations to the General Department. This rebuts the presumption that  default occurs no later than 90 days  past due, reflecting the nature of the IMF’s financing and its unique institutional status as well as consistency with the  threshold for internal risk management purposes. Credit outstanding is considered cred it-impaired when the obligation  has defaulted.   (ii) Significant increase in credit risk  The General Department assesses whether a significant increase in credit risk has occurred on a member-by-member  basis by comparing the risk of default at the reporting date  with the risk of default at t he date of the most recent  disbursement to the debtor member. The assessment is  performed on each reporting date and takes into account a  range of qualitative and quantitative criteria, including  overdue obligations to the IMF, signals of noncooperation by  the member, and forward-looking indicators of capacity to repay the IMF. The criteria used to identify significant  increases in credit risk are monitored and reviewed for  appropriateness at least annually.   The assessment does not rely on any single factor and may,  on the basis of other relevant considerations, rebut the  presumption that credit risk has increased significantly when contractual payments are mo re than 30 days past due.  During the financial years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021, the General Department did not have any member more than 30 days past due, except for one member in protracted  arrears at April 30, 2021, which were subsequently settled  (see Note 5.2).  (iii) Low credit risk   The General Department assumes that the credit risk of a member country has not increased significantly since initial recognition if the member is determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date, as defined below.   Credit risk related to the General Department’s exposure to a member country is considered low if: (i) it has a low risk of default; (ii) the member country  has a strong capacity to meet  its contractual cash flow obligations in the near term; and (iii) adverse changes in economic and business conditions in  the longer term may, but will not necessarily, reduce the  ability of the member country to fulfill its contractual cash flow  obligations.   (iv) Measuring ECL  ECL are determined by comparing expected cash flows with contractual cash flows and discounting the expected cash  shortfalls at the effective interest  rate, which is the basic rate  of charge. ECL are estima ted by assessing a range of  possible outcomes in light of expected future economic  conditions, weighted according to the assessed probability of  each outcome. This entails considerable judgement and uncertainty about the estimates.   For the purpose of ECL measurement, financial safeguards that are integral to the IMF’s financial structure and  operations are also considered, such as the burden-sharing  mechanism to compensa te the IMF for loss of income due to  overdue payments (see Note  13.1) and the Special  Contingent Account (SCA-1) to pr otect the IMF in case of the  ultimate failure of a member to repay its overdue obligations to the GRA (see Note 13.2).  Write-off  In the unlikely event that a member with credit outstanding (i) withdraws from the IMF; ( ii) repudiates its outstanding  obligations to the General Depar tment; and (iii) there are no  prospects of recovering amounts due to the General  Department in the foreseeable future, the IMF would  recognize the ultimate loss and the withdrawn member’s credit outstanding to the G eneral Department would be  written off.   3.2.2  SDR holdings   SDR holdings represent SDRs held by the GRA (see Note 6).  SDR holdings are measured at AC.  Interest on SDR holdings is recognized using the effective  interest method.   3.2.3  Investments   Investments are financial assets that include equity securities, real estate investment trusts (REITs), private  infrastructure debt, fixed-in come securities, short-term  investments, fixed-term deposits, and derivative assets. Derivative liabilities are disclosed as part of other liabilities in  the statements of fi nancial position.  I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021     17 Investments in each of the tw o subaccounts are managed in  accordance with their respective investment strategy (see  Note 7) and their performance is evaluated on a fair value  basis. The business model for the invested portfolios focuses on achieving fair value gains. Accordingly, these securities  are classified at FVPL. Funds pending suitable investment in  accordance with the investment  strategy may be kept in  fixed-term deposits, which are measured at amortized cost.  Purchases and sales of investments are recognized on the  trade date. The corresponding investment trades receivable  or payable are recognized in other assets and other liabilities,  respectively, pending settlement of a transaction.  Investment income compri ses interest income on  investments at AC, interest and dividend income, and  realized and unrealized gains and losses from FVPL investments, including currency valuation differences arising  from exchange rate movements against the SDR, net of all  trading-related fees.  Interest income from investments is recognized using the  effective interest method. Dividend income is recognized  based on the ex-dividend date.  3.3  Cash and cash equivalents   Usable currencies and SDR holdings are considered cash and cash equivalents in the statements of cash flows.  3.4  Gold holdings  Gold holdings (acquired prior to the Second Amendment of  the IMF’s Articles of Agreement in April 1978) are carried at  historical cost using the spec ific identification method. The  carrying value is determined by the restrictions on the use of  the IMF’s gold holdings and the di sposition of profits from the  sale of gold. In accordance with the provisions of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, whenever the IMF sells gold that was  held on the date of the e ffectiveness of the Second  Amendment of the IMF’s Articles  of Agreement, that portion  of the proceeds equal to the hist orical cost must be placed in  the GRA. Any proceeds in excess of the historical cost will be held in the SDA or transferred to the Endowment Subaccount  of the IA (see Note 9). The IMF may also sell such gold  holdings to those members that were members on August 1, 1975, in exchange for their currencies and at a price equal to  the historical cost.  3.5  Property, plant and equipment and intangible  assets  Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are  measured at historical cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization. Property, plant and equipment and intangible  assets are capitalized and depreciated or amortized over the  estimated remaining useful lives using the straight-line method. Buildings are deprecia ted over 30 years and other  property, plant and equipment over 3 to 20 years. Leasehold  improvements are depreciated ov er the term of the lease  agreement. Software is amortized over three to five years.  3.6  Post-employment benefits  The IMF sponsors various post-employment benefit plans for its employees, which include defined benefit and other  post-employment benefits such as medical and life insurance  benefits (see Note 11).  The net asset/liability under each retirement benefits plan  recognized in the statements of financial position is the  present value of the defined ben efit obligation less the fair  value of the plan assets. Changes resulting from remeasurements are reported in other comprehensive  income. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined using the projecte d unit credit method by  discounting the estimated future cash outflows using market  yields on high-quality corporate bonds.   Net periodic pension cost includes service cost and net  interest cost on the net asse ts/liabilities under retirement  benefit plans.  3.7  Financial liabilities  3.7.1  Special Contingent Account The SCA-1 was used by the General Department to  accumulate precautionary balances under the burden- sharing mechanism (see Note 13.2) against possible credit  default. Balances in the SCA-1 are akin to refundable non-interest-bearing deposits.   3.7.2  Borrowings   Borrowings are financial liabilities that represent financing  received under the various borrowing arrangements  (see Note 14).  Interest expense on borrowings is calculated by applying the  effective interest method.   3.7.3  Quota subscriptions   Members’ quota subscriptions are financial liabilities that  represent subscription payments by members, including  payments as a result of quota increases (see Note 15.1). An increase in quota subscription for an existing member  becomes effective when the member both consents to the  quota increase and makes the actual payment (provided that any other requirements for the effectiveness of the specific  quota increase are met), and the increase is recorded in the financial statements on the payment  date. Typically, about a  quarter of a member’s quota subscription (reserve asset portion) is paid either in SDRs or in the currencies of other members specified by the IMF, or in any combination of I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021    18 SDRs and such currencies; and the remainder is paid in the  member’s own currency.   Quota subscriptions are cla ssified as liabilities in the  statements of financial position, as they embody an  unconditional repayment obligation in the case of a member’s  withdrawal from the IMF.  3.7.3.1  Reserve tranche positions and remuneration  A member acquires a reserve tranche position in the GRA in  exchange for the reserve asset portion of its quota subscription payment, and from the use of the member’s  currency in the GRA’s transactions or operations (see  Note 15.2).   The GRA pays interest, referr ed to as remuneration, on a  remunerated portion of t he member’s reserve tranche  position (see Note 18). Remuneration expense is recognized  on an accrual basis.   3.8  Provisions  Provisions are recognized when the IMF has a current legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is  probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made. Provisions are measured at  the present value of the amoun ts that are expected to be  paid to settle the obligations.  3.9  Foreign currency translation  Transactions denominated in currencies and not in SDRs are  recorded at the rate of exchange on the date of the  transaction. Assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies are reported using the SDR exchange rate on the  date of the financial statements. Exchange differences  arising from the settlement of transactions at rates different  from those at the originating date of the transactions are  included in the determination of net income.  3.10  Fair value measurement  Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between  market participants at the m easurement date. A fair value  measurement is based on th e presumption that the  transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either in the principal market for the asset or liability or, in the absence of a principal market, in the most  advantageous market.  A three-level fair value hierarchy is used to determine fair  value under which financial instruments are categorized  based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique. The fair value hierarchy has the following levels:  When the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset  or liability fall within multiple le vels of the hierarchy, the level  within which the fair value me asurement is categorized is  based on the lowest-level input t hat is significant to the fair  value measurement of the instrument in its entirety. Thus, a  Level 3 fair value measurement may include inputs that are  both observable and unobservable. Transfers in and out of  the fair value hierarchy levels  are recognized at the end of  the reporting period.  The valuation techniques used to determine fair value are  described in Note 8.  3.11  Amendments to existing standards that became  effective in the financial year ended April 30, 2022  Amendments to IFRS 9, “Financial Instruments”, and IFRS 7,  “Financial Instruments: Disclosures” were issued in August 2020 to address financial reporting issues related to the  reform of an interest rate benchmark, including its  replacement with alternative benchmark rates. The  amendments are effective for annual periods starting on or  after January 1, 2021, and were adopted by the General  Department on May 1, 2021. The amendments had no  material effect on the General Department’s financial  statements.  3.12  Amendments to existing standards effective in  future years  The following amendments to existing standards issued by  the IASB will become effective in  future financial years.   Amendments to IFRS 9, “Financial Instruments” were issued in May 2020 to clarify certain aspects of derecognition of financial liabilities. The amendm ents are effective for annual  periods starting on or after January 1, 2022. The amendments will be adopted by t he General Department for  the financial year ending Ap ril 30, 2023, and are not  expected to have a material effect on the General Department’s financial statements.  Amendments to IAS 1, “Pre sentation of Financial  Statements” and IFRS Prac tice Statement 2, “Making  Materiality Judgements” were issued in February 2021 to  help entities apply materiality judgements to accounting  policy disclosures. The amendments are effective for annual Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical  assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the  measurement date;   Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly  (i.e., derived from prices);  Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021     19 periods starting on or after January 1, 2023. The  amendments will be adopted by t he General Department for  the financial year ending Ap ril 30, 2024, and are not  expected to have a material effect on the General Department’s financial statements.  Amendments to IAS 8, “Accounting Policies, Changes in  Accounting Estimates and Errors” were issued in February  2021 to clarify the definition of accounting estimate. The  amendments are effective for annual periods starting on or  after January 1, 2023. The amendments will be adopted by  the General Department for the financial year ending  April 30, 2024, and are not expected to have a material effect on the General Department’ s financial statements.  4.  Financial risk management   The General Department is exposed to various types of  operational and financial risks, including credit, market, and  liquidity risks.  4.1  Risk management framework  By virtue of its role establishe d through the IMF’s Articles of  Agreement, the IMF faces a range of financial and nonfinancial risks. The Executive Board has approved a risk  acceptance statement guiding risk acceptance and  assessment across the IMF’s activities. The IMF has adopted the three lines of defense model for risk management.   Risks inherent in day-to-day o perations are mitigated by  establishing and main taining a system of internal controls.   A risk management function is responsible for developing  and maintaining the risk management framework, fostering the development of  risk management tools, and  reporting on the General Depart ment’s overall risk profile,  highlighting areas where additional mitigation efforts are needed.    An internal audit function is responsible for providing an independent assessment of  the effectiveness of  governance and internal control processes.    Oversight is provided by committees established to monitor  and make decisions in specific risk areas, which supports the  cycle of risk assessment, ownership, and mitigation vis-à-vis risk acceptance.   4.2  Financial assets and liabilities other than  investments  Financial assets and liabilities other than investments are  exposed to credit, market, and liquidity risks. 4.2.1  Credit risk on financial assets and liabilities other than  investments  Credit risk is the risk of suffering financial losses, should any  of the IMF’s members fail to fulfill their financial obligations to the GRA. Credit risk arises on credit outstanding and  undrawn committed amounts under approved financing  commitments.  Credit risk is inherent in the IMF’s unique role in the  international monetary system  because the IMF has limited  ability to diversify its credit portfolio and generally provides  financing when other sources of credit are not available to a  member. In addition, the IMF’s credit concentration is generally high due to the nature of the financial assistance  provided to its member countries.  Measures to help mitigate the IMF’s credit risk in financing  arrangements include program design and conditionality,  which serve to help member countries solve their balance of  payments problems within the period of an IMF-supported program and to provide the ne eded assurances that the  member will be able to repay the IMF. Other risk mitigating policies include access limits, post financing assessments,  surcharge policies, preventive and remedial measures for  dealing with overdue financial obligations, and the burden- sharing mechanism (see Note 13).   The IMF has established limits on overall access to  resources in the GRA, except for the FCL arrangements that are not subject to any access limits (for limits applicable to  SLL arrangements, see below). The annual limit is normally  set at 145 percent of a member ’s quota, with a cumulative  limit of 435 percent of a mem ber’s quota (net of scheduled  repurchases). In response to the COVID-19 crisis, the annual  limit was temporarily increased to 245 percent of quota  annually for the period from July 13, 2020, through  December 31, 2021.   Access in excess of these limits can be granted in  exceptional circumstances. Except for PLL arrangements,  there is no prespecified maximum on exceptional access to IMF resources, which is assessed on a case-by-case basis in  accordance with the policy framework on exceptional access.  The IMF assesses factors such as the size of balance of  payments needs, the member’s debt sustainability and its  ability to regain access to financing from other sources, the  member’s capacity to repay the Fund, and the strength of  policies to be adopted.   PLL arrangements have a cumulative access limit of  500 percent of quota (net of scheduled repurchases). Access  under a six-month PLL arrangement is subject to a limit of  125 percent of quota. In exceptional circumstances where a member is experiencing or has the potential to experience  larger short-term balance of payments needs due to the I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021    20 impact of exogenous shocks, including heightened regional  or global stress conditions, access under a six-month PLL  arrangement is subject to a higher limit of 250 percent of  quota.  SLL arrangements have revolving access, and multiple  purchases and repurchases may take place during the  course of the arrangement, subj ect to a limit of 145 percent  of quota on the total credit outstanding at any given date under current or any prior SLL arrangements.   Further, in September 2020, the IMF established policy  safeguards when a member requests financing with  combined access to GRA and Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRG Trust) resources in excess of specified  thresholds. These thresholds are set at the same levels that  trigger application of the GRA exceptional access framework.  The safeguards are also broadly aligned with the criteria and  procedures applied in the GRA exceptional access  framework described above. There were no limits on combined access to GRA and PRG Trust resources prior to  September 2020.  The annual limit for RFI purchases is normally set at 50  percent of a member’s quota, with a cumulative limit of 100  percent of a member’s quota ( net of scheduled repurchases).  These limits were temporarily increased to 100 percent of  quota annually and 150 percent of  quota cumulatively (net of  scheduled repurchases) for the period from April 6, 2020,  through June 30, 2023.  Purchases under SBA and EFF arrangements are made in  tranches and are subject to conditionality in the form of performance criteria, indicative targets, structural  benchmarks, and prior actions, as well as regular reviews by  the Executive Board.   In addition, the IMF has adopted a safeguards policy to  mitigate the risk of misuse of resources and a misreporting policy to deal with incorrect reporting of data or performance  against any conditions under an IMF-supported program.  Safeguards assessments of member central banks are undertaken to provide the IMF with reasonable assurance  that the central bank’s legal structure, governance, control,  reporting, and auditing systems are adequate to maintain the integrity of its operations and to manage resources, including  IMF disbursements. When IMF resources are provided as  direct budget financing to the government, the safeguards policy also requires that IMF disbursements be deposited at  the central bank, and that an appropriate framework  agreement between the central bank and the government be  in place to ensure timely servicing of the member’s financial  obligations to the IMF. Further, a fiscal safeguards review of the state treasury is requir ed for cases where a member requests exceptional access, and at least 25 percent of IMF funds are expected to be used fo r direct budget financing.   The maximum credit risk exposure is the carrying value of the IMF’s credit outstanding a nd undrawn commitments.   4.2.1.1  Credit outstanding  Credit outstanding comprised SDR 93,031 million and  SDR 89,788 million at April 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively  (see Note 5). The concentration of GRA outstanding credit by  region was as follows:     The use of credit in the GRA by the largest users was as  follows:    The five largest users of GRA credit at April 30, 2022, and 2021, in descending order, were Argentina, Egypt, Ukraine,  Pakistan, and Ecuador. Credit outstanding by member is  presented in Schedule 1.  In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant number  of countries have benefited from emergency financial  assistance under the RFI (see Note 5.1), including 21  countries with a total disbursed amount of SDR 9,480 million  that did not have credit outst anding from the IMF at March  31, 2020. There is no ex-post program-based conditionality or reviews under the RFI, with overall conditionality limited.  4.2.1.2  Undrawn commitments  Undrawn commitments under GRA arrangements amounted  to SDR 102,614 million and SDR 93,457 million at April 30,  2022, and 2021, respectively. Commitments and undrawn balances under current arrangements are presented in  Schedule 3.   April 30, 2022  April 30, 2021  (in millions of SDRs and as a percentage  of total GRA credit outstanding)   Africa 12,305 13.2% 10,438 11.6%  Asia and Pacific 1,833 2.0% 1,886 2.1%  Europe  8,675 9.3% 9,914 11.0%  Middle East and Central  Asia 24,864 26.7% 24,490 27.3%  Western Hemisphere  45,354 48.8% 43,060 48.0%  Total 93,031 100.0% 89,788 100.0%   April 30, 2022  April 30, 2021   (in millions of SDRs and as a percentage of  total GRA credit outstanding)   Largest user of credit  33,221 35.7% 31,914 35.5%  Three largest users of  credit  54,708 58.8% 52,294 58.2%  Five largest users   of credit  65,001 69.9% 62,067 69.1%  I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021     21 No purchases under RFIs had been approved by the  Executive Board, but not yet disbursed at April 30, 2022  (SDR 630 million at April 30, 2021).   The undrawn commitments under GRA arrangements have  also increased as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic (see  Note 1.5) as the IMF has approved new financial assistance under its lending arrangements (including to four countries  that had not had a lending arrangement with, or credit  outstanding to the IMF at Ma rch 31, 2020) and augmented  existing lending arrangements to accommodate urgent new  needs arising from the impact of the pandemic.  4.2.2  Market risk on financial assets and liabilities other than  investments Market risk is the risk that the fa ir value or future cash flows  of financial instruments will fl uctuate because of changes in  market prices. Market risk for financial assets and liabilities other than investments includes interest rate risk and  exchange rate risk.  4.2.2.1  Interest rate risk  Interest rate risk is the risk t hat future net cash flows will  fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. All interest-bearing financial instru ments other than investments  of the General Department accr ue interest either at the SDR  interest rate or at a rate that is linked to the SDR interest rate  (see Note 2.2). Interest rate risk is primarily managed by  linking the rate of charge directly, by means of a fixed margin, to the cost of financing (which is equal to the SDR  interest rate).   4.2.2.2  Exchange rate risk  Exchange rate risk is the risk that the General Department’s  financial position and cash flows will be affected by  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.    The General Department has no exchange rate risk  exposure on its holdings of members’ currencies in the GRA because members maintain the value of such  holdings in SDR terms (see Note 5).    The General Department has other assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than SDRs and makes  administrative payments largely in US dollars, but the exchange rate risk exposure associated with these  activities is limited.    The General Department has no exchange rate exposure  from its current borrowing arrangements because all  drawings are denominated in SDRs.  4.2.3  Liquidity risk on financial assets and liabilities other than investments  Liquidity risk is the risk to the General Department of  nonavailability of resources to meet the financing needs of  members and its own obligations. The IMF must have usable resources available to meet members’ demand for IMF  financing. While the IMF’s resources are largely of a  revolving nature, uncertainties in the timing and amount of  credit extended to members during financial crises expose the IMF to liquidity risk. Moreover, the IMF must also stand  ready to provide resources for unexpected needs, for  example, to: (i) meet, upon a member’s representation of  need, potential demands for a drawing on the member’s  reserve tranche; and (ii) authorize drawings to meet demands for encashment of creditor claims under the New  Arrangements to Borrow (NAB) or the bilateral borrowing  agreements (see Note 14).  The IMF manages its liquidity risk by closely scrutinizing  developments in its liquidity position. The IMF’s main liquidity  measure—Forward Commitment Capacity -represents the  IMF’s capacity to make new GRA resources available to its  members over the following 12 months (see Schedule 2).   Long-term liquidity needs are addressed by reviewing the  adequacy of quota-based resources. General reviews of  members’ quotas are conducted at regular intervals to  evaluate the adequacy of quot a-based resources to meet  members’ demand for IMF financing. The IMF may also borrow to supplement its quota resources (see Note 14).  Short-term liquidity needs for financing activities are reviewed  and approved by the Executive Board on a periodic basis  through a financial transactions plan for quota resources and  the resource mobilization plan for borrowed resources.   4.2.3.1  Maturity profile of fi nancial assets and liabilities other  than investments  Depending on the type of financing instrument, repurchase  periods for GRA credit vary from 3¼ to 10 years. Scheduled  and overdue repurchases of outstanding GRA credit are  summarized below:      Repayments of outstanding borrowings are determined  according to the schedule of repurchases of credit that was  financed by borrowed resources. They also take into account  the maximum maturity of outstanding borrowings, which was  April 30, 2022  April 30, 2021   Financial year (in millions of SDRs )  2022 —  8,961  2023 19,198  19,777  2024 23,252  24,006  2025  18,497  18,183  2026 9,494  7,842  2027 6,446  3,692  2028 and beyond 16,144  7,185  Overdue —  142  Total 93,031  89,788  I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021    22 equal to 10 years for all outstanding borrowings. Scheduled  repayments of outstanding borrowings are summarized  below:    Repurchases during the financial years ended April 30, 2022,  and 2021, included advance repurchases of SDR 3,797 million and SDR 3,677 million, respectively.  These advance repurchases resulted in earlier than  scheduled repayments of outstanding borrowings of SDR 1,134 million and SDR 2,094 million, respectively.  Future interest payments on borrowings calculated at the  SDR interest rate at April 30, 2022, represent SDR 10 million for the financial year ending April 30, 2023. Thereafter, a total  of SDR 3 million will be paid th rough the last repayment date.  Usable and other currencies, SDR holdings, and quota subscriptions do not have maturity dates.  4.3  Investments  Investments are exposed to credit, market, and liquidity risks.  4.3.1  Credit risk on investments  Credit risk on investments repr esents the potential loss if  issuers and counterparties were to default on their  contractual obligations.   Credit risk in the IA is minimized by limiting fixed-income  investments to financial instrum ents with a credit rating at the  time of acquisition:   For the Fixed-Income Subaccount, effective January 12,  2022 the minimum credit rating is set at the equivalent of  BBB– (based on Standard & Poor’s long-term rating scale)  for corporate bonds and BBB+ for all other assets (at least A for all assets before January 12, 2022).    For the Endowment Subaccount, the minimum credit rating is set at BBB+ for so vereign bonds and BBB– for  corporate bonds and private infrastructure debt. Limited holdings in the Endowment Subaccount of corporate  bonds and private infrastructure debt rated below BBB–  are permitted under the Rules and Regulations of the  Investment Account.   Exempt from the credit rating requirement are instruments  issued by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS),  which does not have a credit ra ting, central bank deposits,  and short-term instruments.  The carrying amount of the fixed-income instruments represents the maximum exposure to credit risk. The credit  risk exposure for fixed-income instruments in the IA, at the  end of the respective reporting periods, was as follows:   Fixed-Income Subaccount    April 30, 2022 April 30, 2021  (as a percentage of total investments in  fixed-income instruments)   Not rated (BIS) — 0.0% 2,557 15.6%  AAA  5,422 29.3% 5,918 36.2%  AA+ to AA–  7,075 38.3% 3,435 21.0%  A+ to A  5,741 31.1% 4,305 26.4%  BBB+ 240 1.3% 125 0.8%  Total  18,478 100.0% 16,340 100.0%      Counterparty risk for derivative instruments is mitigated by strict exposure limits, cr edit rating requirements, and  collateral requirements. The ma ximum exposure to credit risk  for derivative instruments is the amount of any unrealized  gains on such contracts.   The credit risk exposure for derivative instruments in the  Fixed-Income Subaccount amounted to SDR 106 million and  SDR 38 million at April 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The  credit risk exposure for derivative instruments in the Endowment Subaccount amounted to SDR 58 million and  SDR 5 million at April 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively.  4.3.2  Market risk on investments  Market risk is the risk that the fa ir value or future cash flows  of financial instruments will fl uctuate because of changes in  market prices. Market risk for investments incl udes interest  rate risk, exchange rate risk, and other price risks.  The investment objectives of the Fixed-Income and  Endowment Subaccounts differ, and the investment  strategies, including asset allocation and risk tolerance, are  tailored for each of the subacc ounts, thereby exposing them  to different types of market risk.

General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021     23 4.3.2.1  Fixed-Income Subaccount  The Fixed-Income Subaccount holds debt obligations of a  broad range of issuers within limits defined by the Rules and  Regulations of the IA (see Note 7.1 for the eligible investments). Market risk is mitigated through asset class  diversification and within asset classes through broad security selection.   The Fixed-Income Subaccount authorizes the use of  derivative instruments for managing interest rate risk, currency hedging, or reducing co sts in the context of portfolio  balancing, benchmark replication, and market access. Safeguards are in place against short selling and financial leverage.  Exchange rate risk is mitigated by hedging investments  denominated in non-SDR currencies into SDR basket currencies with the objective of preserving the Fixed-Income  Subaccount’s SDR basket composition.  4.3.2.2  Endowment Subaccount   Investments are divided into eight categories, which are  subject to varying market risks and benefits from  diversification properties (see  Note 7.2 for the eligible  investments). Market risk is mitigated through asset class  diversification and within asset classes through broad security selection.   Effective January 12, 2022, except for the allocation to  emerging market equities, which may be managed actively, all Endowment Subaccount assets shall be managed  passively (prior to January 12, 2022, the Endowment  Subaccount was split into the passively-managed portfolio managed in accordance with the strategic asset allocation  and the actively-managed portfolio, which could comprise up  to 10 percent of the Endowment assets, invested in the same  asset categories with target  shares for fixed-income  instruments and equities with out specific allocation  requirements within those shares).   The Endowment Subaccount authorizes the use of derivative  instruments for managing interest rate risk, currency hedging, or reducing costs in the cont ext of portfolio balancing,  benchmark replication, and market access.   Because the IMF’s administrative expenditures are largely in  US dollars and the Endowment Subaccount’s general  objective is to contribute to  covering such expenditures (see  Note 1.2), the performance of the Endowment Subaccount is  measured in US dollars as the base currency but translated into SDRs for financial reporting. The Rules and Regulations  of the IA provide for hedging against the exchange rate risk  for fixed-income instruments denominated in developed  market currencies vis-à-vis the US dollar. The valuation changes from exchange rate fluctuations are included in the determination of investment income.   4.3.2.3  Value at risk  Exposures to market risk, including interest rate, exchange rate, and other price risks, are measured using VaR, which  considers known market risks in each of the asset categories  and the effect of asset class diversification. VaR estimates  reported below represent the maximum potential loss in  value of the assets over the ne xt year due to adverse market  movements with a 95 percent c onfidence level. There is a  1 in 20 chance that annual losses on investment assets are equal to or exceed the reported VaR. Losses in a single year could exceed the reported VaR by a significant amount.  The VaR model is based on historical simulations with a  three-year look back period and monthly overlapping risk factor returns for each individual instrument in the portfolios  to produce plausible future scenarios based on these  simulations. In each simulation scenario, risk factor data on the valuation date is shocked according to past observations  and each instrument is repriced, resulting in a hypothetical  empirical distribution of re turns. There is no standard  methodology for estimating VaR, and the modeling of the market risk characteristics of the investments involves many  assumptions and some limited pr oxy or substitutes. Different  assumptions or methodologies would produce significantly different VaR estimates.   The VaR for the Fixed-Income Subaccount portfolio was as  follows:   April 30, 2022 April 30, 2021   (in millions of SDRs )  Tranche 1 (see Note 7) 169 65  Tranche 2 (see Note 7) 107 58  Diversification effects (26) (47)  Total Fixed-Income Subaccount 250 76   I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021    24 The VaR for the Endowment Subaccount portfolio was as  follows:   April 30, 2022 April 30, 2021   (in millions of SDRs )  Passively managed portfolio:   Developed market equities 397 493  Emerging market equities 182 203  Global Sovereign bonds 66 —  Developed market sovereign bonds n/a1 65  Developed market corporate bonds 60 51  Emerging market bonds n/a1 17  US Treasury Inflation-Protected        Securities 68 52  Real estate investment trusts 175 97  Private infrastructure debt 17 5  Infrastructure equities 55 —  Diversification effects (296) (236)  Total for passively managed  portfolio 724 747  Actively managed portfolio:    Fixed-income securities — 10  Equity securities — 39  Diversification effects — (11)  Total for actively managed portfolio — 38  1 Following the changes to the investment  strategy approved by the Executive  Board on January 12, 2022, the investment categories of developed market  sovereign bonds and emerging market bonds were restructured into the global sovereign bonds category.     4.3.3  Liquidity risk on investments  Liquidity risk on investments refers to the risk that an investment will not have an active buyer or seller when  traded, which could negatively affect the price of the  investment.  The IA’s liquidity needs are low and the liquidity risk is  minimal because both subaccounts hold the majority of their resources in readily marketable short-term investments. 4.3.3.1  Maturity profile of investments The maturities of the fixed-income securities and derivatives  in the Fixed-Income Subaccount were as follows:     April 30, 2022 April 30, 2021  Financial year  (in millions of SDRs)   2022  — 6,909  2023 5,659 3,131  2024 5,294 2,179  2025  3,346 1,554  2026 2,110 1,254  2027 1,535 425  2028 and beyond 891 1,154  Total 18,835 16,606   The maturities of the fixed-income securities and derivatives  in the Endowment Subaccount were as follows:   April 30, 2022 April 30, 2021  Financial year  (in millions of SDRs)   2022  — 392  2023 496 376  2024 344 396  2025  388 455  2026 390 461  2027 361 303  2028 and beyond 1,331 1,346  Total 3,310 3,729    Investments in both subaccounts largely represent liquid  investments, which could be sold earlier than their maturity,  whenever necessary.  4.4  Post-employment benefit plans  The General Department is exposed to investment, liquidity, and longevity risks associated wit h post-employment benefit  plans (the Plans). These risks are balanced a gainst the need  to meet the financial obligations of each plan. The Plans have adopted general guidelines on permissible investments and plan assets are invested a ccording to a strategic asset  allocation, which is expected to generate a rate of return at or in excess of the rate of growth in the Plans’ liabilities. The strategic asset allocation is reviewed periodically by the  Investment Committee. The strategic asset allocation is  designed to minimize the level of portfolio market risk  (volatility) for the targeted rate of return, while better aligning  portfolio volatility with the potential volatility of the Plans’  liabilities. Through a global, multiple-asset-class investment  approach, the portfolio risk is r educed for any targeted rate of  return, because asset class returns are not perfectly  correlated as regional and global economic, financial, and political events unfold. The Pl ans do not utilize specific,  targeted asset-liability matching  instruments or strategies I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021     25 such as annuities, longevity swaps, cash flow matching, or  duration matching.  The primary objective with respect to liquidity is to have  sufficient liquid resources available to pay benefits when due. This risk is monitored to ensure that payments due to the  participants and beneficiaries can be met from the holdings  of cash and highly liquid investments of the Plans.  4.5  Precautionary balances  Precautionary balances consist of the GRA reserves (excluding that portion repres enting the profits from the  2009–10 gold sales that have been earmarked for the  Endowment Subaccount), and t he balance in the SCA-1.  They are a key element of the Fund’s multilayered risk  management framework as they provide a buffer to protect  the Fund against unexpected losses resulting from credit,  income, and other financial risks. The Executive Board conducted an interim review of the adequacy of  precautionary balances in December 2021, ahead of the  standard two-year cycle given the need for close monitoring  due to the heightened uncertainty in the global economy  linked to the pandemic and the path and timing of the recovery. In concluding the interim review, the Executive  Board kept the medium-term indicative target and minimum  floor for precautionary balances at SDR 25 billion and SDR 15 billion, respectively (the medium-term indicative  target had been raised from SDR 20 billion to SDR 25 billion  during the previous review of the precautionary balances in November 2020).  During the December 2021 interim review, the Executive  Board approved a new approach for the treatment of retirement benefit plans in th e computation of precautionary  balances. This approach better reflects the role of precautionary balances as a long-term buffer for economic  and financial risks. Under the new approach, referred to as  the ‘economic basis’, the defined benefit liability of the plans  is measured using a discount rate that reflects the  expected  long-term return on plan assets. Any net liability measured under the economic basis is used in calculating precautionary balances in place of the net asset/liability  calculated under IAS 19 (see Note 11). However, any net  asset measured under the economic basis would not be used in calculating precautionary bala nces. The change took effect  from May 1, 2021. A one-time increase of SDR 205 million was made to precautionary ba lances as at that date,  reflecting the accumulated net loss to date, to align with the new measurement methodology.   At April 30, 2022, and 2021, precautionary balances  amounted to SDR 20.9 billion and SDR 20.0 billion,  respectively, and were calculated as follows:   April 30, 2022  April 30, 2021   (in millions of SDRs)  Special Reserve (Note 16)  13,692 11,347  General Reserve (Note 16) 12,832 12,003  Excluding profits from gold sales (4,403) (4,403)  Adjustment for net assets/liabilities under  retirement benefit plans under  IAS 19 (Note 11.2) (1,248) n/a  Adjustment for net liabilities  under retirement benefit plans  under the economic basis —1 n/a   SCA-1 (Note 13.2)   — 1,066  Total precautionary balances 20,873 20,013  1 The measurement of the retirement benefit plans under the economic basis  resulted in a net pension asset at April 30, 2022. As such, further adjustments to  precautionary balances were not required after excluding the net assets/liabilities determined under IAS 19.  5.  Currencies, including credit outstanding  Under the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, members are  required to maintain the value of the GRA’s holdings of their  currencies in terms of the SDR. Any depreciation or  appreciation in a member’s currency vis-à-vis the SDR gives  rise to a currency valuation adjustment receivable or payable that must be settled by the mem ber promptly after the end of  the financial year or at other times as requested by the IMF  or the member. Currency holdi ngs of SDR 454,718 million at  April 30, 2022, included receivables and payables arising  from those valuation adjustm ents of SDR 19,796 million and  SDR 13,073 million, respectively (currency holdings of  SDR 458,656 million at April 30, 2021, included receivables  and payables of SDR 25,618 million and SDR 10,182 million,  respectively).  All holdings of members’ currencies are typically revalued at  the IMF’s financial year-end.   5.1  Credit outstanding  At April 30, 2022, and 2021, members’ use of GRA credit  was represented by currency holdings of SDR 93,031 million  and SDR 89,788 million, respectively. I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021    26 Changes in credit outstanding under the various facilities of  the GRA were as follows:  1 Other facilities include legacy credit under Enlarged Access and Supplementary  Financing Facility.    1 Other facilities include legacy credit under Enlarged Access and Supplementary  Financing Facility.    5.1.1  Emergency financial assistance  The tables above reflect emergency financing under the RFI  that was provided by the General Department to members  facing urgent balance of payment s needs as a result of the  economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Credit  outstanding by member is presented in Schedule 1.  Following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the access  limits for RFI purchases were temporarily increased (see  Note 4.2.1).  5.1.2  Impairment analysis  The General Department has performed an impairment  analysis of credit outstanding  in accordance with its ECL  model (see Note 3.2.1.1). Based on this analysis, no loss  allowance was deemed to be necessary at April 30, 2022,  and 2021. As described in Note 3.2.1.1, the impairment analysis of the General Depa rtment’s credit outstanding  takes into account the unique  nature of the IMF’s financing  and its institutional status, and is performed holistically for  each debtor member based on  qualitative an d quantitative  considerations and taking into account relevant current developments, including the geopolitical and global economic developments as described in Note 1.5. In this context, the  results of the impairment ana lysis at April 30, 2022, and  2021, are not materially sensitive to reasonable changes in  input parameters of the ECL calculation.  5.2  Overdue obligations  At April 30, 2022, no member was six months or more overdue in settling its financial obligations to the General  Department (one member—Sudan—was six months or more  overdue in settling its financial obligations to the General Department at April 30, 2021).   On June 29, 2021, Sudan settled all of its overdue  obligations to the General Department, including GRA credit outstanding and overdue char ges of SDR 142 million and  SDR 738 million, respectively . Settlement of the overdue  charges generated burden-sharing refunds to members totaling SDR 611 million that had been previously collected  through burden-sharing adjustments to charges and  remuneration (see Notes 13.1, 13.2, 17, and 18).   6.  SDR holdings  The General Department can receive SDRs from members in  the settlement of their financia l obligations to the GRA and  quota subscription payments. In  addition, the GRA may use  or receive SDRs in transactions and operations with members, including the provision of financial assistance to  members, the receipt of charges and fees, and the payment of remuneration on reserve tranche positions or interest on  borrowings to member countries and lenders.  At April 30, 2022, and 2021, the SDR holdings of the General  Department amounted to SDR 22,270 million and  SDR 22,203 million, respectively.  The GRA earns interest on its SDR holdings at the same rate  as other holders of SDRs. Interest on SDR holdings during  the financial years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021, amounted to SDR 25 million and SDR 17 million,  respectively.  7.

General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021     27 During the financial year ended April 30, 2022,  SDR 2,393 million was transferred from the GRA to the IA, as  approved by the Executiv e Board (SDR 319 million  transferred from the IA to the GRA during the financial year  ended April 30, 2021).  On January 12, 2022, the Executive Board reviewed the  strategy of the Investm ent Account and approved  refinements to the investment strategies of the Fixed-Income Subaccount and the Endowment Subaccount, as reflected in Notes 1.2, 4.3.1, 4. 3.2, 7.1, and 7.2. Im plementation of these  changes has been initiated, but will be completed during the year ending April 30, 2023.  7.1  Fixed-Income Subaccount   The Fixed-Income Subaccount comprises two tranches, a  shorter-duration Tranche 1 and a longer-duration Tranche 2.  Effective January 12, 2022, the average duration of the  Fixed-Income Subaccount should not exceed three years  (prior to January 12, 2022, the Fixed-Income Subaccount  had an average duration limit of two and a half years with  Tranche 1 managed against a zero- to three-year  government bond benchmark index and Tranche 2 against a zero- to five-year government bond benchmark index).  Tranche 1 is managed actively, while Tranche 2 is managed  according to a buy-and-hold investment approach, which in limited circumstances allows for the sale of investments in  accordance with the overall in vestment strategy prior to  maturity. Tranche 2 was phased in over a five-year period, which concluded in 2021. Prior to completion, assets pending  investment in Tranche 2 were placed in fixed term deposits.  Both tranches can be invested in debt obligations issued by  national governments of member s, their central banks and  official agencies, international financial institutions, and obligations of the BIS, denomi nated in SDRs or currencies  included in the SDR basket, referred to as Group 1 assets for investment management purposes . Eligible investments in  Tranche 1 also include fixed-income securities issued by  subnational governments, corporate bonds,  mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, and cash instruments with maturities  of one year or less, referred  to as Group 2 assets for investment management purposes. Assets are being invested by external managers, except for investments with the BIS and short-term investments  (residual cash balances). Effective January 12, 2022, Group 2 assets should not exceed 40 percent of the Fixed-Income  Subaccount portfolio (35 percent before January 12, 2022).         Investments in the Fixed-Income Subaccount were as follows:   April 30, 2022   Tranche 1 Tranche 2 Total    (in millions of SDRs)   At fair value through profit or loss:    International financial institutions  obligations:          Medium-term instruments (BIS)  — — —       Others  528 1,701 2,229  Sovereign bonds 7,199 4,693 11,892  Corporate bonds 3,616 — 3,616  Securitized assets 741 — 741  Short-term investments 214 37 251  Derivative assets  106 — 106  Total at fair value through profit or  loss 12,404 6,431 18,835  At amortized cost:     Fixed-term deposits — — —  Total 12,404 6,431 18,835     April 30, 2021   Tranche 1 Tranche 2 Total   (in millions of SDRs)  At fair value through profit or loss:    International financial institutions  obligations:          Medium-term instruments (BIS)  — 1,806 1,806       Others  439 569 1,008  Sovereign bonds 7,786 1,615 9,401  Corporate bonds 2,757 — 2,757  Securitized assets 616 — 616  Short-term investments 215 14 229  Derivative assets  38 — 38  Total at fair value through profit or  loss 11,851 4,004 15,855  At amortized cost:     Fixed-term deposits — 751 751  Total 11,851 4,755 16,606   I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021    28 Fair values of derivative assets and liabilities in the  Fixed-Income Subaccount at April 30, 2022, were  SDR 106 million and SDR 77 million, respectively  (SDR 38 million and SDR 40 million for derivative assets and liabilities, respectively, at April 30, 2021). Notional values of  derivative instruments were as follows:  7.2  Endowment Subaccount   The assets of the Endowment Subaccount are invested in a  globally diversified portfolio consisting of fixed-income and equity instruments (including REITs), and private  infrastructure debt. Assets are invested by external  managers, except for short-term investments (residual cash balances).   The Endowment Subaccount is invested in accordance with  the strategic asset allocation in  select investment categories  approved by the Executive Board.  Each investment category  is invested to achieve exposure to broad characteristics of the specific asset class.   The refinements to the investm ent strategy approved by the  Executive Board on January 12, 2022, modified the strategic  asset allocation by reorganizing some investment categories  and shifting the allocations between the categories including:  (i) a reduction in the allocation to government bonds; (ii) a reduction in inflation-linked bonds; (iii) a dedicated allocation  to infrastructure equities; and (iv) an increase in REITS.  The strategic asset allocation includes a 5 percent allocation  to private infrastructure debt. The IMF invests in this asset  class through commingled funds and its commitments are  drawn down over time based on notices from the respective  investment managers. At Apr il 30, 2022 and April 30, 2021,  total original commitments amounted to SDR 171 million.  During the financial year ended April 30, 2022, total capital  calls under the commitments totaled SDR 96 million and  distributions amounting to SDR 1 million were paid back to the General Department (SDR 14 million and SDR 1 million  for capital calls and distributions, respectively, during the financial year ended April 30, 2021). Investments in the Endowment Subaccount, all of which are classified as FVPL, consisted of the following investment  categories:   April 30, 2022 April 30, 2021   (in millions of SDRs)   Passively managed portfolio:    Developed market sovereign bonds n/a1 894  Developed market corporate bonds 927 1,005  Emerging market bonds n/a1 274  Global sovereign bonds 971 —  US Treasury Inflation-Protected        Securities 969 1,214  Developed market equities 1,614 1,565  Emerging market equities 643 639  Infrastructure equities 340 —  Real estate investment trusts 676 347  Private infrastructure debt 97 12  Short-term investments 288 184  Total passively managed portfolio  6,525 6,134  Actively managed portfolio:    Fixed-income securities — 143  Equity securities — 134  Short-term investments — 10  Total actively managed portfolio — 287  Derivative assets  58 5  Total 6,583 6,426  1 Following the changes to the investment  strategy approved by the Executive  Board on January 12, 2022, the investment categories of developed market  sovereign bonds and emerging market bonds were restructured into the global sovereign bonds category.     Investment categories comprise funds managed to achieve  exposure to broad characteristics of the specific asset class.  Funds may include holdings in other asset classes. Market  exposure may be achieved throug h derivative instruments,  where necessary and as determined under the IA’s Rules  and Regulations.  Fair values of derivative assets and liabilities in the  Endowment Subaccount at April 30, 2022, were SDR 58 million and SDR 15 million, respectively  (SDR 5 million and SDR 16 million for derivative assets and liabilities, respectively, at April 30, 2021). Notional values of derivative instruments were as follows:  April 30, 2022 April 30, 2021   (in millions of SDRs)   Futures    Long positions 452 465  Short positions 2,038 2,336  Currency forwards 3,258 1,587  Interest rate swaps 633 643  Currency swaps — 718  Options on futures 3 —  Swaptions — 63   April 30, 2022 April 30, 2021   (in millions of SDRs)   Futures    Long positions 16 22  Short positions 9 29  Currency forwards 3,571 2,329  I.

Fair value measurement   Valuation techniques used to value financial instruments  include the following:  Level 1  The fair value of publicly tr aded investments is based on  quoted market prices in an active market for identical assets  without any adjustments (clo sing price for equities and  derivative instruments and bi d price for fixed-income  securities). These investments are included within Level 1 of  the fair value hierarchy.   Level 2 The fair value of equity and fixed-income securities not actively traded is determined on the basis of a compilation of  significant observable market information, such  as recently  executed trades in securities of the issuer or comparable  issuers and yield curves. The assessment also takes into  account the inherent risk and terms and conditions of each security. Given that the significant inputs are observable,  these securities are included wit hin Level 2 of the fair value  hierarchy.   The fair value of over-the-c ounter derivative instruments  (foreign exchange forwards, curr ency/interest rate swaps) not  actively traded is determined using a pricing model that  incorporates foreign exchange spot and forward rates and interest rate curves. Given that  the significant inputs into the  pricing models are market obser vable, these instruments are  included within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.  Level 3  The private infrastructure debt assets classified within Level  3 have significant unobserva ble inputs, as they trade  infrequently or do not trade at all. As observable prices are  not available for these assets, the mark-to-model valuation  technique is used to derive the fair value. Different assumptions or approximations could produce significantly  different valuation estimates.   8.1  Investments   The following tables present the fair value hierarchy used to  determine the fair value of investments in the IA:   April 30, 2022   Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total  (in millions of SDRs)   Recurring fair value measurements    Fixed-Income Subaccount 133 18,702 — 18,835  Endowment Subaccount 3,270 3,216 97 6,583  Total 3,403 21,918 97 25,418     April 30, 2021   Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total  (in millions of SDRs)   Recurring fair value measurements    Fixed-Income Subaccount 194 15,661 — 15,855  Endowment Subaccount 2,707 3,707 12 6,426  Total 2,901 19,368 12 22,281    During the financial year ended April 30, 2022, investments totaling SDR 11 million in the Endowment Subaccount were transferred from Level 1 to Level 2 (there were no transfers  from Level 1 to Level 2 in the Fixed-Income Subaccount).  These investments relate to equity securities where trading was either inactive or quoted prices in the applicable market  were not observable as at April 30, 2022. Quoted prices for  similar securities directly observable in an alternative market  were used for fair value measurement of these securities as  at April 30, 2022. During the financial year ended April 30, 2021, there were no transfers from level 1 to level 2 in both  the Fixed-Income and Endowment Subaccounts.    There were no transfers between levels 2 and 3 of fair value  hierarchy in both the Fixed-Income and Endowment  Subaccounts during the financial years ended April 30, 2022,  and 2021. I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021    30 Fixed-term deposits in the IA are generally of a short-term  nature and are carried at amorti zed cost, which approximates  fair value.  Derivative liabilities at April 30, 2022 comprised  SDR 16 million valued based on quoted market prices  (Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy) and SDR 76 million  valued based on observable market data (Level 2 in the fair  value hierarchy) (SDR 8 million and SDR 48 million for  Level 1 and Level 2, respectively, at April 30, 2021).  8.2  Credit outstanding   The IMF plays a unique role in providing balance of  payments support to member countries. IMF financing  features policy conditions that  require member countries to  implement macroeconomic and structural policies and are an  integral part of IMF financing. These measures aim to help  countries resolve their balanc e of payments problems while  safeguarding IMF resources. The fair value of IMF credit  outstanding cannot be deter mined due to its unique  characteristics, including the debtor’s membership relationship with the IMF, and the absence of a principal or  most advantageous market for IMF credit.   8.3  Other financial assets and liabilities   The carrying value of other financial assets and liabilities that  are classified at AC represents a reasonable estimate of their  fair value at April 30, 2022, and 2021.  9.  Gold holdings   The IMF acquired its gold holdings from quota subscriptions and financial transactions prior to the entry into force of the  Second Amendment of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement  (April 1, 1978). At April 30,  2022, and 2021, the IMF held  gold of 2,814 metric tons, equal to 90.474 million fine troy ounces, at designated depositories. Gold holdings were valued at a historical cost of SDR 3,167 million at April 30,  2022, and 2021, based on a cost of SDR 35 per fine troy ounce.  At April 30, 2022, the market value of the IMF’s holdings of  gold was SDR 128.6 billion (SDR 111.4 billion at  April 30, 2021).   10.  Property, plant and equipment and intangible  assets  Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, net of  depreciation and amortization, amounted to SDR 551 million and SDR 555 million at April 30, 2022, and 2021,  respectively, and consisted of land, buildings, equipment,  furniture, and software.

Employee benefits  11.1  Overview of the Plans  The IMF has a defined benefit Staff Retirement Plan (SRP) that covers all eligible staff and a Supplemental Retirement  Benefits Plan (SRBP) for a subset of participants of the SRP.  The SRBP provides for the payment of benefits that  otherwise would have been payable had the US qualified  plan benefits and compensation limits not applied. Participants in the SRP and SRBP (the pension plans) are  entitled to unreduced annual pensions beginning at the  normal retirement age of 62 or earlier if certain conditions of  age and service are met. The mandatory retirement age is  Land Buildings Other Total   (in millions of SDRs)  Financial year ended April 30, 2021:    Cost          Beginning of the year 95 436 401 932        Additions — 1 46 47        Disposals — — (27) (27)      End of the year 95 437 420 952  Accumulated depreciation and amortization:      Beginning of the year — 163 212 375        Depreciation and amortization — 12 37 49        Disposals — — (27) (27)      End of the year — 175 222 397  Net book value at April 30, 2021 95 262 198 555 I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021     31 65. The pension plans also provide an option for eligible staff  to receive reduced pension be nefits beginning at the age of  50. The level of pension benefits depends on the participants’ length of service and highest three-year average pensionable gross compensation. Participants may also elect upon  retirement to commute a portion of the lifetime pension  benefits into a lump-sum payment.  On June 3, 2021, the Executiv e Board approved changes to  the SRP and SRBP with an effect ive date of May 1, 2022, to  update the formula for the co mputation of the pensionable  gross compensation. The amount of past service cost  resulting from these changes recognized in the statement of income for the year ended April 30, 2022, amounted to  negative SDR 57 million.   The IMF provides other non-pension long-term benefits,  including medical insurance, life insurance, separation and  repatriation benefits, accrued annual leave, and associated  tax allowances. The IMF has established a separate account, the Retired Staff Benefits Investment Account (RSBIA), to  hold and invest resources set asid e to fund the cost of certain  post-retirement benefits.   In May 2020, the Executive Board approved changes to  separation and repatriation benef its with an effective date of  October 1, 2020. The past servic e cost resulting from these  changes recognized in the stat ement of income for the year  ended April 30, 2021, amounted to SDR 6 million. In April 2022, the Executive Board ap proved changes to medical  benefits covered by the RSBI A with an effective date of  January 1, 2023. The past service cost resulting from these changes recognized in the stat ement of income for the year  ended April 30, 2022 was a gain of SDR 112 million.  The assets in the SRP, SRBP, and RSBIA (collectively, the  Plans) are held separately from  the assets of all other  accounts of the IMF. Also, the net asset position in one of the  Plans cannot be netted with the net liability position in  another Plan. In the event the IMF were to exercise its right  to terminate the Plans, the assets of these plans would be used to satisfy liabilities to par ticipants, retired participants,  and their beneficiaries and other liabilities of the pension plans. Any remaining assets would be returned to the GRA. The GRA meets the costs of administering the Plans, and the  SRP and RSBIA reimburse the GRA for investment-related  costs.   The Executive Board and t he Pension Committee are  responsible for the governance of the Plans. The Executive  Board approves the funding framework and amendments to  the Plans. The Pension Committ ee, consisting of members of  the Executive Board a nd senior staff, super vises and controls  the overall administration of  the SRP and the SRBP. The  Pension Committee also undert akes periodic valuations of the assets and liabilities related to the Plans and advises the  Executive Board on the appropri ate funding framework. It is  supported by an Investment Committee to oversee the investments of the Plans.  11.2  Net assets/liabilities and benefit costs under  retirement benefit plans  The amounts recognized in the statements of financial  position were as follows:   April 30, 2022 April 30,  2021   Pension  benefits Other  employee  benefits Total   Total    (in millions of SDRs)   Defined benefit  obligation (8,610) (1,856) (10,466) (11,425)  Plan assets 9,404 2,310 11,714 11,220  Net assets 794 581 1,375 —  Net liabilities  — (127) (127) (205)    The amounts recognized in the statements of income and  statements of comprehensive income were as follows:   2022 2021   Pension  benefits Other  employee  benefits Total Total    (in millions of SDRs)   Service cost (262) (105) (367) (407)  Past service cost 57 112 169 (6)  Interest expense related to  defined benefit obligation (280) (71) (351) (335)  Interest income related to plan assets 271 65 336 244  Net periodic pension cost  recognized in the statements of income (214) 1 (213) (504)  Remeasurement of defined benefit obligation 1,405 630 2,035 457  Net return on plan assets excluding amounts included in interest income (393) (94) (487) 2,532  Exchange differences (19) (14) (33) 166  Amounts recognized in other comprehensive income 993 522 1,515 3,155  Total gain recognized in  statements of  comprehensive income 779 523 1,302 2,651   I.

The actuarially  determined employer contributions to the pension plans  during the financial year ended April 30, 2022 amounted to 10.66 percent of pensionable gross compensation  (13.06 percent of pensionable gross compensation during the  financial year ended April 30, 2021). Under the IMF’s funding  framework, the budgetary allocations for payments to the  pension plans have been set at 14 percent of pensionable gross compensation. The IMF expects to contribute  SDR 150 million to the Plans during the financial year ending  April 30, 2023.  The expected pension and benefits payments to be paid out  by the Plans over the next five years were as follows at  April 30, 2022:  Financial year  Pension  benefits  Other  employee  benefits Total  (in millions of SDRs)  2023 332 85 417  2024 348 70 418  2025 368 74 442  2026 385 76 461  2027 401 79 480  11.3  Principal actuarial assumptions  The IMF conducts a comprehensive analysis of the principal actuarial assumptions used in calculating the net assets/liabilities under retirement benefit plans every five  years and reviews their applicability on an annual basis. The  most recent five-year analysis was completed in April 2021.   The principal actuarial assumptions used in the actuarial  valuation were as follows:   April 30, 2022  April 30, 2021   (in percent)   Discount rate/expected return on  plan assets 4.18 3.02  Rate of salary increases (average)  3.50  Health care cost trend rate  4.00–6.50 4.00–6.75  Inflation  2.00  Life expectancy: (in years)  Male  89.6 89.5  Female  93.0 92.9    The assumed retirement rate ranges from 5 percent at age  50 to 100 percent at age 65, and the assumed participation  rate for medical benefits upon retirement is 85 percent.  The weighted average dura tion of the defined benefit  obligation was 15.8 years at Ap ril 30, 2022 (19.1 years at  April 30, 2021).   2022 2021   Pension  benefits Other  employee  benefits Total Total   (in millions of SDRs )  Beginning of the year 9,112 2,313 11,425 12,018  Current service cost 262 105 367 407  Past service cost (57) (112) (169) 6  Interest expense 280 71 351 335  Employee contributions 44 — 44 44  Actuarial gain due to  demographic assumptions  changes — (172) (172) (120)  Actuarial gain due to financial  assumptions changes (1,405) (458) (1,863) (337)  Benefits paid (273) (58) (331) (314)  Exchange differences 647 167 814 (614)  End of the year 8,610 1,856 10,466 11,425  I.

Burden-sharing and the Special Contingent  Account  13.1  Burden-sharing for deferred charges   The IMF has adopted a burden-sharing mechanism to  address the financial consequences of member countries’  failure to settle financial obligations to the GRA on time.  Under the burden-sharing mechanism, resources are generated by increasing the rate of charge paid by borrowers  and reducing the rate of remuneration paid to creditor  members to cover shortfalls in the GRA’s income due to the  nonpayment of charges.   Members that participated in  burden-sharing for overdue  charges receive refunds to the extent that t hese charges are  subsequently settled by the defaulting member. During the financial year ended April 30, 2022, the General  Department refunded the full amount of remaining burden- sharing adjustments amounting to SDR 611 million resulting  from the settlement of all outstanding overdue GRA charges  previously deferred (see Note 5.2). There were no deferred charges at April 30, 2022.  There were no burden-sharing refunds during the financial  year ended April 30, 2021. Overdue charges that resulted in  adjustments to charges and remuneration for the year ended  April 30, 2021, amounted to SDR 2 million (see Note 17). Cumulative overdue charges that resulted in adjustments to  charges and remuneration since May 1, 1986 (the date the  burden-sharing mechanism was adopted) amounted to SDR 2,051 million at April 30, 2021. The cumulative refunds  for the same period, resulting from the settlements of  overdue charges for which burden-sharing adjustments had  been made, amounted to SDR 1,440 million at  April 30, 2021.   13.2  Burden-sharing for the SCA-1  The burden-sharing mechanism has also financed additions  to the SCA-1, which offers protection against the risk of loss  resulting from the ultimate failure of a member to repay its overdue obligations to the GRA.   Contributions to the SCA-1 are to be returned when there are  no outstanding overdue repurchases and charges, or at such earlier time as the Executive Board may decide.  During the financial year ended April 30, 2022, in connection  with the clearance of Sudan’ s arrears to the IMF, the  Executive Board decided to make a distribution of the remaining SDR 1,066 million in the SCA-1 to contributing members. The distribution took place on June 29, 2021, and  the SCA-1 balance amounted to zero at April 30, 2022  (SDR 1,066 million at April 30, 2021). I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021    34 Effective November 1, 2006, t he Executive Board decided to  suspend, for the time being, further additions to the SCA-1.  Accordingly, no additions have been made to the SCA-1  during the financial years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021.   14.  Borrowings  The GRA can borrow to temporarily supplement its quota  resources. The Executive Boar d has established guidelines  on borrowing by the GRA to ensur e that the financing of the  GRA is managed in a prudent and systemic manner.   The GRA’s main standing borrowing arrangement is the  NAB. The GRA may also borrow under bilateral agreements, in particular loan and note purchase agreements (bilateral  borrowing agreements). At April 30, 2022, the NAB credit  arrangements amounted to SDR 360.8 billion and the bilateral borrowing agreements amounted to  SDR 138.1 billion; see Schedules 4 and 5, respectively.  14.1  New Arrangements to Borrow   The NAB is a standing set of credit arrangements with 40 participants, of which 38 ag reements were effective at  April 30, 2022, and 2021. The NAB provides supplementary  resources to the GRA as a second line of defense to IMF  quotas.   NAB periods are renewed periodically. In January 2020, the  Executive Board approved a NAB reform that doubled NAB  commitments and set a new NAB period through end 2025.  NAB participants have since provided the necessary consents and this reform took effect as targeted on January  1, 2021. Following the effect iveness of the reform, the  effective NAB commitments amounted to 360.8 billion at April 30, 2022, and 2021.  NAB resources can be activated when the Fund’s resources  need to be supplemented in order to forestall or cope with an  impairment of the internat ional monetary system. The  activation requires the consent of participants representing  85 percent of total NAB credit  arrangements of participants  eligible to vote and the approval  of the Executive Board. The  NAB was not activated at April 30, 2022, and 2021.  Drawings under the NAB can be made to finance purchases  by borrowing members for outright purchases and under  arrangements that were approved during the period when the NAB was activated. Claims under the NAB are encashable  on demand by participants, subject to certain conditions.  14.2  Bilateral Borrowing Agreements   Bilateral borrowing agreements are intended to serve as a third line of defense to IMF quotas and NAB resources. The  current round of bilateral borrowing agreements, which have been in effect since January 1, 2021, were signed under a framework established by the Executive Board in 2020. They  have an initial term through end-December 2023, which may  be extended by one more year, subject to creditor consent.   At April 30, 2022, lenders’  commitments under effective  borrowing agreements totaled US$185.6 billion, equivalent to  SDR 138.1 billion (US$193.9 billion equivalent to  SDR 135.0 billion at April 30, 2021).   Resources under bilateral borrowing agreements can be  activated only if the amount  of IMF resources otherwise  available for financing has fallen below a threshold of SDR 100 billion and either the NAB is activated or there are no available uncommitted NAB resources. Activation requires  approval by bilateral creditors r epresenting 85 percent of the  total credit amount committed.   Drawings under the borrowing agreements may be made to  finance purchases by borrowing members for outright  purchases and under arrangements that were approved during the period when the borrowing agreements were  activated. Claims under the bilateral borrowing agreements  are encashable on demand by lenders, subject to certain conditions.  14.3  Outstanding borrowings  Outstanding borrowings represent  drawings under the NAB,  are denominated in SDRs, and carry the SDR interest rate. There were no outstanding borrowings under bilateral  borrowing agreements at April 30, 2022, and 2021.  There were no drawings under the NAB or bilateral  borrowings during the financial years ended April 30, 2022,  and 2021. Repayments under the NAB during the same periods amounted to SDR 2,523 million and  SDR 3,765 million, respectively. Total outstanding NAB  borrowings at April 30, 2022, and 2021, were SDR 2,615  million and SDR 5,138 million, respectively (see Schedule 4).   The average interest rate on outstanding borrowings was  0.107 percent per annum and 0.077 percent per annum for  the financial years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021,  respectively.  The interest expense on outstanding borrowings  during the same periods was SDR 4 million and  SDR 6 million, respectively.  15.  Quota subscriptions and reserve tranche  positions  15.1  Quota subscriptions  The IMF’s resources are primarily provided by its members  through the payment of quota subscriptions, which broadly I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021     35 reflect each member’s relative position in the global  economy. Quotas also determine each member’s relative  voting power, its share in SDR allocations, and its access to  IMF resources.   The IMF conducts a general review of members’ quotas at  intervals of not more than five years. The review allows the  IMF to assess the adequacy of quota resources to meet its  needs and to allow for adjustments to members’ quotas to  reflect their relative positions in the world economy.   The Fourteenth General Review of Quotas became effective  in January 2016. At April 30, 2022, 187 members had  consented and paid in full their quota increases, amounting to SDR 238 billion (184 members at April 30, 2021,  amounting to SDR 238 billion) . This amount represents over  99 percent of the total quota increases that members were  eligible for at January 26, 2016 (SDR 239 billion). Quota subscription payments under the Fourteenth General Review  of Quotas during the years e nded April 30, 2022, and 2021,  amounted to SDR 0.5 billion and SDR 2 million, respectively.  The Fifteenth General Review of  Quotas was concluded in  February 2020 with no increase in IMF quotas. The Sixteenth  Review is planned to be concluded no later than  December 15, 2023.  On October 16, 2020, the Princi pality of Andorra became the  190 th member of the IMF wit h an initial quota of  SDR 83 million, which was paid in full during the financial  year ended April 30, 2021.  15.2  Reserve tranche positions  The reserve tranche is determined as the difference between the member’s quota subscription and the GRA’s holdings of its currency, excluding holdings that reflect the member’s use  of GRA credit and administrative balances. A member’s  reserve tranche is also considered a part of its international  reserves and a liquid claim against the GRA that can be  encashed by the member at any time upon the representation of a balance of payments need.    Members’ reserve tranche positions were as follows:    April 30, 2022 April 30, 2021   (in millions of SDRs )  Quota subscriptions 476,272 475,808  Total currency holdings 454,718 458,656  Less: GRA credit outstanding (93,031) (89,788)  Less: administrative balances (161) (167)   361,526 368,701  Reserve tranche positions 114,746 107,107  16.  Reserves of the General Resources Account  16.1  Reserves of the General Resources Account  The GRA reserves consist of the Special Reserve and the  General Reserve. The General Reserve may be used inter  alia to meet capital losses and operational deficits or for  distribution to IMF members. The Special Reserve can be  used for the same purposes except distribution to members. At April 30, 2022, the balanc es of Special and General  Reserves amounted to SDR 13,692 million and SDR 12,832 million, respectively (SDR 11,347 million and SDR 12,003 million, respectively, at April 30, 2021).   16.2  Income disposition  The Executive Board determines annually what part of the GRA net income (as described below) will be placed to the General Reserve and/or the Special Reserve, and what part,  if any, will be distributed. Net losses are charged against the  Special Reserve in accordance with an Executive Board  decision.   The GRA net income/losses for the purpose of the income  disposition includes: (i) total income of the GRA; (ii) transfer  from the IA as approved by the Executive Board; and (iii) the  remeasurement of net assets/ liabilities under retirement  benefit plans. For the financia l years ended April 30, 2022,  and 2021, the Executive Board decided to place income to/charge losses against reserves as follows:   Special Reserve  General Reserve    Income Remea- surement Total Income Remea- suremen tTotal    (in millions of SDRs)  Balance at      April 30, 2021 10,842 505 11,347 10, 983 1,020 12,003  Income of the  GRA 830 — 830 829 — 829  Transfer from the IA — — — — — —  Remeasurement of net assets/liabilities  under retirement  benefit plans — 1,515 1,515 — — —  Balance at    April 30, 2022 11,672 2,020 13,692 11,812 1,020 12,832   I.

Charges and fees   The average credit outstanding subject to charges amounted  to SDR 90,522 million and SDR 86,700 million for the financial years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively.   The rate of charge levied on outstanding credit is equal to the  basic rate of charge adjusted for burden-sharing (see  Note 13). The basic rate of charge is the SDR interest rate  plus a fixed margin as determined by the Executive Board, which for the years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021,  amounted to 100 basis points. The average rate of charge  (adjusted for burden-sharing) was 1.107 percent per annum  and 1.077 percent per annum for the financial years ended  April 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively.  Credit outstanding in excess of 187.5 percent of quota  resulting from purchases in the credit tranches and under the  EFF and the SLL is subject to a level-based surcharge of  200 basis points per annum above the basic rate of charge.  An additional time-based surcharge of 100 basis points per  annum applies to such credit outstanding for more than three years, except for purchases under the EFF, for which the  additional surcharge of 100 basis points applies after 51 months. Purchases under the SLL are not subject to time-based surcharges given the short maturity of repurchase  obligations.  Charges income consisted of the following:    During the year ended April 30, 2022, the IMF did not have  overdue charges to defer. The deferred charges during the  year ended April 30, 2021, amounted to SDR 2 million (see  Note 13.1) and were fully recovered through the proceeds from burden-sharing adjustments to charges and  remuneration of SDR 1 million each (see also Note 18).

The business enterprise  can, as a result,  create variations of how to approach the  new complex and changing situations of success in the market. Therefore managers are trying  during negative times to  change their management approach, to ensure long -term and stable  running of the business enterpri se.

Key words     Financial analysis, company, profit , activity, profitability, liquidity, indebtedness     INTRODUCTION   In a global market economy that is determined by its constant uncertainty, the business  enterprises  are faced with  demanding economic conditions . They are exposed to constant  changes of environment as well as uncompromised pressure of competitors, who are trying  every day to increase the quality of their products and services and continuously to progress  ahead. This fact results in a negative impact  on the whole performance of the business subject.   The business subject, in order to be able to maintain a stable and competitive position on  the market, to provide inputs for the management, to make important strategic decisions and to  achieve their econo mic goals, is forced to constantly analyse  and monitor their financial  situation with which appears towards financial subjects and the surrounding’s situation. A  principal factor of effective financial management consist  SLOVAK UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY  in Bratislava , s of financial situation knowledge. For this purpose the financial analysis is used.  With it the business subject will be capable to prevent the crisis, which would lead to  remediation or even to bankruptcy.  74     OBJECTIVE     The objective of this ar ticle is to provide  basic knowledge about financial analysis ex -post  and subsequently to evaluate the business subject progress in an area of activity, liquidity  profitability and indebtedness, to reveal strengths and opportunities that the business subject  should rely on . Furthermore, it also aims to  determine weaknesses and threats that could lead  them to difficult situations and based on the results to provide measures to improve the system  of financial economic analysis of the business subject.     METHODS     In th is article the basic scientific methods used were  analysis, synthesis, induction,  deduction and hypothesis  creation . A synthesis of theory and knowledge will serve to obtain  the theoretical basis to meet the set objective. The analysis will f ocus on the financial statements  of a public limited company w hich produc es equipment and components for the mining,  chemical and energy industries, as well as boat and marine components. From the results of the  analysis , by induction, deduction and hypoth esis creation, we shall draw conclusions and  suggest actions for improvement of the business subject’s financial and economic analysis  system.     1. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF THE SELECTED COMPANY     The financial situation of the business subject is considered to be  a complex output of their  whole performance. This output is presented through the ratio indicators of activity,  profitability, liquidity, indebtedness and market value. These indicators are based on the  synthetic indicators of financial accounting and they  demonstrate the complexity of the business  subject’s performance interpretation  (Baran  and Pastýr , 2014, 6) .    1.1 Financial analysis  - Ex post   A financial situation analysis is the foundation of the company’s economic performance  analysis and usually proceeds down to primary fields and results as effectivity, efficiency,  production capacity utilisation , supplement management and the like. Financial analysis detect s  weaknesses  and strengths of the comp any, is the tool of “health” diagnostics and provides  essential information to business management and to owners (Vlachynský, 2009, 369) .  Sedláček understands the financial analysis of the company as a method of the company’s  financial management evaluatio n, during  which the data obtained is graded, aggregated  and  compared to each other . Furthermore,  the relationships between them are quantified, looking  for the causal connection between the data and their development  is determined . This increases  the explanatory power of data processing and its informative value. Thus it focuses on  identifying problems, strengths, weaknesses and foremost the company’s value processes.  Information obtained through financial analysis enables us to re ach some conclusions about  general management and the financial situation of the company and represents a background  for management decision making (Sedláček, 2009, 3) .   The main purpose of financial analysis is to express assets and the financial position  of the  company and to prepare the inputs for internal management decision making. The c omplexity  and continuous execution are the essential requirements of financial analysis (Hrdý, 2009, 118) . 75   The c ompany’s financial situation is diverse and a multifacet ed complex phenomenon;  consequently this diversity is transferred also into the financial analysis process. The user of  the financial analysis results decides which  indicator’s to select and the priority of utili sation of  individual parts of the financial analysis according to demand and intention (Baran et. al , 2011) .  Among primary users of the financial analysis we might include various subjects mainly  as  owners, managers, employees, lenders (suppliers, banks), debtors (customers), institutions  of state and public administration, external analytics, media and etc (Baran, 2008) .  The review of the company’s financial situation is declared by the system of financial  indicators, which have to be in order and designed to reflect all the important aspects of the  financial situation. Therefore, for a description of the financial situation the ratio indicators are  used. The ratio indicators enable a comparative  analys is of the company with other companies  or with indicators for the relevant area. The s um of ratio indicators we’ll present, can be  considered as the sum of representative indicators. Specifically, these will be the most  commonly used indicat ors of the financial situation  characteristics . However, along with the  practical application , dozens of indicators are used, and it is not possible to mention  all of them  (Baran, 20 15).   In practice , the use of several basic indicators has been proven rel evant which can be  categorised  into groups according to individual areas of management evaluation and the  financial health of the company. Mostly these are groups of indicator s such  as debt, liquidity,  profitability, activity, capital market indicators, as well as other indicators (Knapková, 2013,  84).  Based on the objectives that have been set within this article, we’ll provide more detail on  the ratio indicator s of profitability an d liquidity.     1.1.1 Financial analysis - Indicators of activity   The activity indicators are used for business asset management, because they evaluate how  effectively a business subject manages their assets . A business subject rates the commitment of  indivi dual items of the capital in certain forms of assets . If the business subject may have more  assets  than is appropriate , then unnecessary costs are incur red and the profit is adjusted. In  contrast , if the business subject may have few assets  the possible in comes may be lost  (Baran,  2015) .  When applying indicators of activity we see a problem in the work with flows and stocks.  While the balance sheet represents assets and liabilities at a particular point in time, the profit  and loss statement records the cos ts and revenues continuously over the year. Therefore, when  working with those indicators it is necessary due to the least possible deviation from the actual  that the calculation shows the average of individual balance sheets items (Pastýr , 2014 ).  The t ime of stock turnover testifies how many days does a stock turnover take. In other  words, it indicates the time that is required for the transition of financial resources through  production and products back into the form of money. The ideal situation is w hen the business  subject over time shows a decreasing value of this indicator. A short time (time scale) is usually  the expression of greater efficiency. However, it is necessary to take into account the nature of  the business. Alternatively, in the denomi nator instead of revenues the costs can be used.     stock  turnover =average  stock revenuesx 365   76   The receivables turnover tells how long the business assets hang in the form of receivables  or in how long time the receivables are paid on average. The recommend ed value is obviously  the standard time period of invoices maturity, because most of the consigned products are  invoiced and each invoice has its maturity. If the time period of receivables turnover has been  longer than the standard time period of invoices  maturity that would mean failure to comply  with the trade credit policy from business partners. However, at present it is quite common that  the time of invoices payment exceeds the declared. Definitely, in this case it is important to take  into considerat ion what is the size of the analysed  company. For small businesses the longer  period of receivables maturity may cause significant financial issues with the possibility of  bankruptcy. While large businesses are from the financial point of view more able to  tolerate  longer period of maturity. The time horizon, which could be considered as optimal, should also  meet the criteria of business commercial policy (Růčková, 2005, 122) .    receivables  turnover =average  stock  of short −term  receivables revenuesx 365    The maturity of short -term liabilities reflects the time of incurrence until its payment. This  indicator should reach at least the values of receivables turnover maturity. The indicators of  receivables turnover maturity and the liabilities turnover maturit y are important for assessing  the timing differences from the inception of receivables until their collections and from  incurring of liabilities until the payment. This difference directly influences the business  liquidity. As far as the turnover , the time of commitment is greater than the sum of stock and  receivables turnover, the suppliers credits finance receivables and stock, which  is preferable.  However, it may reflect low liquidity levels. Between the level of liquidity and activity is a  close connect ion and a certain compromise should be looked for (Knapková, 2013, 105) .    liabilities  turnover =average  stock  of short −term  liabilities revenuesx 365    The long -term asset  turnover is relevant in decision -making to determine whether to procure  the next long-term production asset. A lower value of the indicator than the average in the field  is a signal for production to increase capacity utili sation and for financial managers to reduce  business investments (Sedláček, 2001,  61).     long −term  asset  turnover =revenue average  stock  of long −term  assets    In general , with  asset  turnover , it applies that the larger the value of the indicator, the more  positively the situation is asse ssed. A minimal recommended value of this indicator is 1. Yet  the value is influenced  by the industry as well. A low value of indicator means a  disproportionate business subject’s asset facilities and its inefficient use (Knapková, 2013,  104).    asset  turnover =revenues average  stock  of assets    In this case, it is possible to substitute the r evenues with the profits, though the result may be  overestimated due to different types of income that are not related to the main business activity. 77   It is appropriate to use the sale or revenues from the sales of  ones own products and services or  to combi ne both kinds of profits (Knapková, 2013, 104) .    1.1.2 Financial analysis - Indicators of profitability     The indicators of profitability, sometimes referred to as indicators of profit, return,  profitability ratio, are designed as a ratio of the final effect achieved by business activity  (output) to some comparative base (input) that can be on the side of assets  as well as on the side  of liabilities , or to another base. These indicators display the positive or also negative influence  on asset  management, the business subject’s financing and liquidity on profitability  (Kislingerová, 2007, 83) .  All indicators of profitability have a similar interpretation, because they specify how much  EUR of revenues (the numerator) cases per 1 EUR of i ndicator mentioned in the denominator.  Because there exists a multitude of profitability ratio indicators; we’ll address only those that  are the most important. Altogether we’ll approach the explanatory power of selected and  mentioned indicators. In this a rticle we’ll mention the following, in practice most frequently  used indicators of profitability (Baran, 2015) .  A return on sales indicator explains to us, how is the business subject able to use inputs for  their effective operations. The final value of this indicator is directly influenced by the character  of the business activity, price policy, production regulation, etc. A more accurate statement of  this type of indi cator provides us a ratio of partial results of the business subject’s management  to their revenues (Baran, 201 5).    return  on sales =net income income x 100  operating  return  on sales =operating  profit income x 100    share  of added  value  in revenues =added  value income x 100    The profitability indicator (return of income) of total capital compares the result of business  activity with the volume of invested capital (Farkašová, 2007, 42) . This indicator specifies the  assessment of total capital, the business subject  has used for their activity. By assessment of the  capital part of the equity, is a process of profit distribution after tax. It is possible for the  business subject to execute the profit distribution after tax, but not until the general assembly  approves the following:   - to increase capital,   - to subsidi se funds from revenues,   - to retain the profit after tax undistributed or   - to repay dividends (in the case of plc).   By valori sation of capital, the business subject is commissioned to pay back part of the  capital  to the lender. Professional literature states an indicator level reference not to be higher  than the interest rate of long -term loans.     return  on assets  (ROA )=net profit assets x 100   78   A return on equity is essential for the business subject’s owners and for lenders has a  supporting meaning. In general , the value of indicators should be higher than the interest rate  of risk -free bonds (Černá, 1997, 73) .     return  on equity  (ROE )=net profit equity x 100    The level of return on equity is strongly dependent on the return on assets and on the interest  rate of borrowed capital. The increase of the indicator ROE mostly depends on the level of the  business subject’s created profit, on a drop in interest rate of the borrowed capital, on a decline  in the equity’s share on a business subject’s return on assets and a combination of all previous  factors (Baran, 201 5).    1.1.3 Financial analysis - Indicator of liquidity   Liquidity is a combination  of all potential liquid resources that are available for the  company to meet their payment obligations. According to professional literature solvency is  defined as the readiness of the business subject to undertake payment of their obligations at the  time of their reimbursement and therefore is one of the basic conditions of the company’s  successful existence (Sedláček, 2009, 66) .   We can conclude that there exists mutual conditioning of liquidity indicators and solvency.  The condition of solvency is to att ain that the business subject would have part of the assets  bond ed to the available assets, which are disposable to obligations for reimbursement in the  form of short -term financial asset s- mostly bank accounts. Furthermore , we are able to conclude  that th e condition of solvency is liquidity. The indicators of liquidity are put into the ratio : the  individual short -term financial assets against short -term obligations. Indicators of liquidity  engage into the most liquid part of the business subject’s assets  and are divided according to  level of liquidity of individual assets , which are mentioned in the numerator of financial  statements - the balance sheet. The disadvantage of indicators is that these indicators evaluate  liquidity according to balances of short -term asset s (current assets) which on the other hand  mainly depends on future cash -flow (Baran  and Pastyr , 2014, 9) .  Liquidity of the 1st level shows, how many times the short -term financial asset s (current  assets ) covers the  short -term obligations of the business subject. This means, how many times  is the business subject able to satisfy their lenders, if they would convert some of the short -  term asset s (current assets) items instantly into available assets (Baran, 2015, 10) .   For the success of the company it is essential to pay short -term obligations from those  assets  that are designated for this purpose (Valach, 1999, 109) . The 1st level liquidity indicator  has its meaning foremost for the lenders of business subject’s short -term obligations and  provides information of the extent to which the short -term components of capital (borrowed  capital) covers the value of the asset, because lenders undertake some risk, which is, that their  claim won’t be reimbursed. The higher the value of the 1st level liqu idity indicator is, in general,  the more likely is the business subject’s solvency is ensured.   This characteristic is only really a rough sketch, because it s explanatory ability further  depends on the current assets structure, liquidity of individual kind s of current assets and as  well on the type of industry the company operates in (Valach, 1999, 109) .    1st level  liquidity  =current  financial  assets short −term  foreign  sources   79   For coverage of the business subject’s short -term obligations , can be used the immediate  financial resources that are available on bank accounts and in treasury as well as expected  financial resources of not yet refunded short -term obligations. This relationship gives us  liquidity of the 2nd level. As professional li terature states, the recommended values should be  located within interval 1 - 1.5.       2nd  level  liquidity  =current  financial  assets +short −term  obligations short −term  foreign  sources    Liquidity of the 3rd level determines  the ability of the company to pay their obligations to  short -term borrowed capital throug h the current asset s. This means that the company does have  enough short -term resources to manage their regular operation. The optimal i nterval is 1.5 to a  max of 2.5 and in comparison t o the liquidity of 1st or 2nd level is increased for the reasons of  lower liquidity of supplies. The short -term borrowed capital shouldn’t exceed 40 % of the  current asset value  (Kotulič, 2010, 60) .    3rd level  liquidity =current  assets short −term  foreign  sources    Current asset s includes the sum of current financial asset s, short -term receivables and  supplies. Permanent solvency is one of the basic conditions of the business subject’s successful  existence within the market conditions. Thus, the probability of  its maintenance is a reasonable  part of the global characteristic of the business subject’s financial health.      1.1.4 Financial analysis - Horizontal liquidity   A very important task within liquidity analysis is horizontal liquidity. The horizontal  liquidity examines the mutual context and relations among items of assets and items of capital  in financial statements - the balance sheet. The c urrent asset s of the business subject should be  covered by short -term resou rces (Baran  and Pastyr , 2014, 8) .    1.1.4.1 Golden statistic rule   Every kind of asset should be financed by the source of the asset with the reimbursement  period (liquidity) that corresponds to the period of effective use of relevant asset. This fact is  considered as the basic finance management rule and is called the golden statistic rule  (Šlosárová, 2006, 351) .  The golden statistic rule requires that the source coverage of long -term asset s (LA) is long- term sources coverage (LC). This means that the financial resources won’t be available for  shorter than the commitment of equity participation, for which this serves. A relationship  between long -term asset s and long - term sources can be in this case t hreefold (Kotulič, 2010):    LC < LC, or LA – LC < 0 => company is pre -financed,    LA > LC, or LA – LC > 0 => company is under -financed,    LA = LC, or LA – LC = 0 => company asset s are optimally financed.   Balance equilibrium, which has to be preserved in the balance sheet, results in these  relationships having an  effect on the current asset s and its finance. The c urrent asset s (CA)  should be covered mostly by current sources (CS). The difference between CA and CS is called  a NET working capital.  80   1.1.4.2 NET working capital   The net working capital is an indicator, which reconstructs part of the current asset s  (current assets ) that is financed by long -term financial resources, either by equity or by  borrowed capital. The business subject’s net working capital e nables in theory a case that the  business subject in real time is obligated to reimburse a significant proportion of their short - term obligations, which form a meaningful source of their funding to further operate. The  overload of current asset s towards sh ort-term obligations demonstrates to us that the business  subject is from the point of view of current liquidity liquid. This means that the business subject  has a financial background in the form of long -term financial resources. (Baran, 2015)   NWC = curre nt assets  – short -term obligations   where NWC is the net working capital.   1.1.5 Financial analysis - Indicators of indebtedness   The term of indebtedness expresses the fact that the company finances their assets  by  foreign sources. By using foreign sources the company affects both the profitability of  shareholders as well as the business risk. Today, it’s practically pointless for large sized  companies to finance all their assets  from equity or vice versa only fro m foreign capital. By  using only equity would result in an overall return on invested capital reduction within the  company. On the other hand, financing of all business activities only by foreign capital is  excluded, because within the legal regulations a certain mandatory amount of equity to start a  business is bound. Therefore, in business finance  activities its own as well as foreign capital are  implicated. The main motive of financing their activities by foreign capital is the relatively low  price compa red to its own resources. The involvement of foreign sources in business financing  enables reduce costs for the use of capital in the company (Kislingerová, 2007, 96) .  Although the theory of refer red higher cost of equity compared to foreign capital is  questionable , at the present time of low interest rates it seems to be more advantageous to use   ones own equity unless the company or shareholders have it at their disposal.   The indicator of total indebtedness, which is expressed by the ratio of foreign sour ces to  overall assets  further expresses to what extent the assets of the company include foreign  sources. The creditors do not prefer too high a proportion of debt. Rather they favour a lower  proportion of debt. This gives them greater  assurance  that in th e case of the company’s  liquidation their receivables will be more likely satisfied. For the owners , the foreign sources  are less expensive than their own and at a higher debt rate the profitability of capital is increased.  The optimal value of this indica tor for the production company is 40  % up to 60  % (Farkašová,  2007, 39) .    total  indebtedness =foreign  sources assetsx 100    To measure the indebtedness , a ratio of equity to total assets is used.   - coefficient of self -financing, which is a complementary indicator ( self -financing) and their  sum with total indebtedness should give 100  %. This indicator expresses the proportion, in  which the assets  of the company are financed by shareholders’ finances. It is considered as  one of the most important ratios of indebtedness for the overall financial situation  assessment . Yet once again the relation ship with the profitability indicator is important   (Růčková, 200 5, 117) .  coefficient  of self −financing =equity assetsx 100 81   Insolvency notes the relation ship between items - assets and liabilities. If the resulting value  is greater than 1, it is a so -called primary insolvency and if the value is less than 1, we’re talking  about so -called secondary insolvency of the company (Farkašová, 2007 , 40).  insolvency =short −term  liabilities short −term  receiveblesx 100    Credit indebtedness is interpreted as a mutual relation ship between bank loans and  overdrafts in the numerator and fore ign sources located in the denominator. The resulting  relation ship is expressed in a percentage  (Pastýr , 2014 ).   credit  indebtedness =bank  loans  and overdrafts foreign  sourcesx 100  The indicator of interest coverage expresses the number of times the profit is higher than  the paid interest. Hence this indicator is used by the company to determine whether the debt  burden is feasible. It informs shareholders about the company’s ability to pay interests and  creditors about whether and how to ensure their rights in the case of the company’s liquidation.  The inability to pay the interests payments from the profit can predict approaching business  bankruptcy. If the value of this indicator re aches a value of 1, the entire profit would cover the  interest expense. Thus it is recommended that the value of the indicator is higher than 3 (Hrdý,  2009, 130) .    interest  coverage =economic  result  before  tax+interest  expense interest  expense    The indebtedn ess flow tells about the value of commitment in terms of total annual cash  flow of the company. This indirectly implies about the time required to cover the debts from  the annual perspective, where the entire value is considered 100  %. Usually it is requir ed that  the repayment of debt is not longer than 3 years (Farkašová, 2007,  40).    indebtedness  flow =foreign  sources cash  flow    The indebtedness is not always a negative characteristic  of the company. Nevertheless, the  higher the debt, the greater the business risk and the harder it is to obtain foreign sources of  financing foremostly to get a loan from a bank  (Šlosárová, 2006, 345) .    2. RESULTS AND DISCUSSI ON    In this chapter we interp ret the financial -economic analysis of assets , liquidity, profitability  and indebtedness , the golden statistic rule or the net working capital in the specific example of  the following business subject. The research consists of results from the calculations, graphs  and following the course and trend evaluation of the monitored indicators. The data for  financial -economic analysis has been derived from financial statements as the balance sheet,  and profit and loss account. For the cause of relevance we used the statements, reports dated  from 2009 till 2014.      82   2.1 Activity indicators of the monitored business subject     In the next subchapter we’ll look how a business subject manages  its assets and what is its  effectiveness. The exact values of the analysed  indicators and their development can be seen in  Table 1 and Graph 1 (see Tab. 1 and Graph 1 below).   Tab. 1  Indicators of activity    m. u.  2009  2010  2011  2012  2013  2014   Inventory turnover  day 102,41  87,69  113,29  105,36  83,75  90,16   Short -term receivables collection  period  day 88,77  76,01  98,20  91,32  72,60  78,16   The maturity of short -term liabilities  day 101,35  86,79  112,13  104,27  82,89  89,24   Fixed assets turnover  coef.  3,85 4,50 3,48 3,74 4,71 4,37  Total assets turnover  coef.  1,18 1,38 1,07 1,15 1,44 1,34  Source: (Pastýr, 2014,  72)    In graph 1 , the activity indicators of the monitored business subject are graphically shown.     Graph 1  Indicators of activity     Source: (Pastýr, 2014,  73)  The values of assets  turnover through the analysed  period  both increased and decreased .  The highest value the company recorded in 2013 i.e. 1.44. The weakest asset use of the business  subject has been reached in 2011 with the value 1.07. This result has been mostly affected by  an item production in progress and semi -finished products with the value € 3,418,601, which  entered in the following year the highest value € 20,425,932. With the decline of production in  progress als o the profits decreased, which in 2011 have been the lowest during the reporting  period. This implies that the business subject had during  this time issues with contracts, which  has been proved as well by employment decline from 477 to 307. In the last yea r the indicator  declined slightly due to the growth of long -term fixed asset s.  The long -term asset turnover has the same development as total assets  turnover, though the  differences between the values are greater. Fixed asset s had approximately the same va lue, but  is worth noting that in 2013 the value is € 8,719,077 and in 2014, the value is € 26,737,025.  The difference between them was due to constructions and separate movable assets and sets of  movable assets, which grew from the merge r of the analysed  business subject with SAM by the  E.S.C.B, Inc. Bratislava. The indicator reaches its lowest value in 2011 at 3.48. In this year, as  we already stated, the decline of profits from sales of their own products and services occurred.   0,0020,0040,0060,0080,00100,00120,00 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014Inventory turnover Short-term receivables collection period The maturity of short-term liabilities Fixed assets turnover Total assets turnover83   The indicator of the stock turnover time period has fluctuating values  by 6 months . The  peak was reached in 2011 of 113 days. This long stock turnover was been mainly caused by the  decline of material and production in progress and semi -finished products. In this year the  revenues d ecreased by about € 10,960,961. The ideal situation is to achieve the minimum of  this indicator, which occurred  in 2013, when the stock turnover amounted to 83.75 days.   The receivables and stock turnover time period show  similar trends . The lowest value was  reached in 2013, when the short -term receivables collection period was 72.60 days and maturity  of short -term liabilities was 82.89 days. In every reporting year we can see that the short -term  receivables collection had a lower value than the maturity of short -term liabilities. For the  business subject this state is of a positive nature, because it expresses that the customers repay  their debts before the business subject repays its liabilities.   2.2 Profitability indicators of the mon itored business subject     The indicators of profitability are designed as the business subject’s economic result rate  (output) to a comparative item (input). These indicators tell us at what level is the business  subject able to reach profit with the help of the capital  used. In table 2 (see Tab. 2 below) the  profitability indicators values are shown.

This was caused by a larger  amount of orders and subsequently the increase of supplies at the date of the report compilation.  In the following two years this value decreased due to a slight change of sales return state which  stabili sed to the level 11.18 % and 11.68 %.    The return on sale s shows a similar trend to the operating return on sale s. Until  2012 the  operating return on sale s has shown an increase , when the indicator reached almost 17.65 %  mainly due to the lower return on sale s of their own products and services and due to higher  profit from business activity  operations . In the last two years the income from operations  stabili sed yet the revenues incr eased, which caused the indicator to decrease to 13.90 % and to  13.74 %.   Once again, in 2012, the share of added value to revenues , displayed  the highest value  at  35.90 %, which for the business subject over the last  6 years was the most successful. Within  the next  two years , a lower value occurred mainly due to change of revenues size from the sale  of their products and services. The i ndicator shows  overall positive progress.   The p ositive profitability of the total ca pital reflects  the production power, and provides   details about the effective asset utili sation and thus the assets of the business subject. This  indicator has been increasing every year and the highest value reached in 2013 of 16.50 %. In  the following year, only a small decline to 14.03 % occurred mainly due to the merge r with a  minor business subject and due to the increase in fixed assets of land, buildings and non -fixed  assets.     Return on equity invested  by the owners into the business, reache d a positive value as well,  which is a positive signal for the business subject’s owners. It is worth not ing 2013, in which  the return on equity reached  the level of 45.59 %. This was caused by a decrease of retained  earnings, wh ich means, that the profit was r edistributed among owners of the public limited  company via dividends reimbursement.    In the latest  year the return on equity value declined to 31.14 % due to capital funds  subsid ies.    2.3 Liquidity indicators of the monitored business subject   The business subject’s ability to repay their obligations is a necessary factor for a long- term successful venture. Therefore constant monitoring is important by both the business  subject and by external users, who could cooperate with the business subject  or that already  cooperate with them. In table 3 (see Tab. 3 below) the values of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd level liquidity  indicators are shown.     Tab. 3  Indicators of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd level of liquidity    m. u  2009  2010  2011  2012  2013  2014   Liquidity of  1st level  coef.  0,15 0,14 0,31 0,23 0,04 0,07  Liquidity of  2nd level  coef.  0,69 0,97 1,68 0,51 0,87 0,52  Liquidity of  3rd level  coef.  1,68 2,00 2,85 1,40 1,20 0,89  Source: (Pastýr, 2014, 71)     Graph 3 shows the monitored business subject’s indicators for the  1st, 2nd and 3rd level of  liquidity.      85   Graph 3  Indicators of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd level of liquidity     Source: (Pastýr, 2014, 71)     According to the recommended range for engineering business subjects indicated by  professional literature the values of the 1st level of liquidity should vary from 0.2 to 0.6. When  looking at the table, it is visible that the values of the monitored business subject are ge nerally  much lower and they don’t reach the recommended value . This tells us about the business  subject’s inability to instantly refund their short -term obligations. The lowest rate that the  indicator has registered was during  the most recent two years, wh en the values reached 0.04  and 0.07 %. These low values were mainly caused by an increase of obligations from business  relations hips and an increase of obligations  towards the owners. Two exceptions can be taken  as a positive fact and that is 2011 with a value of 0.31 and 2012 with a value of 0.23.  The 2nd  level of liquidity should vary within an  interval of 1-1.5. Within this range only the value 1.68  achieved in 2011 is located. In recent years , the values were lower than the interval limit 1. The  lowest value 0.51 was reached in 2012. This value was largely influenced by accruals, more  accurately, by short - term deferred revenues, which reached up 17  400 198 €. From these values  we can assume that the business s ubject besides in 2011 didn’t have the ability to refund their  short -term obligations with their short -term receivables. Also in the case of a need to repay their  short -term obligations the business subject would have to proceed with a change of less liqui d  asset s to more liquid asset s. For the  3rd level of liquidity the business subject’s supplies were  included. The r ecommended values should vary between  2 and 2.5. Within this range falls 2010  with the value 2 and 2011 with the value up to 2.85. For some p ositive fact we can consider  that the business subject has their 3rd level liquidity over the value of 1, which creates a situation,  in which they are able to repay their short -term obligations with their current asset s. The  indicator’s lowest value is achieved by the business subject in 2014 at 0.89 due to changes of  several items of production in the progress decline, blank stock, business relation ship  receivables, the increase in other current reserves and liabilities  towards partners.     2.4 Horizontal liquidity of the monitored business subject   In the following part of the article we  will outline  the achieved values of different  indicators, the golden statistic rule and the net working capital of the business subject.       0,000,501,001,502,002,503,00 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014Liquidity of  1st level Liquidity of  2nd level Liquidity of  3rd level86   2.4.1 Golden statistic rule   In table 4 (see Tab. 4 below) the values of the golden statistic rule indicator of the monitored  business subject for each year are shown.

Graph 4  Indicator of the golden statistic rule in €     Source: own research    A view of the business subject’s long -term funding displays the golden statistic rule. From  graph 4 it is clearly seen that the business subject was in all analysed  years of time series, with  exception of the latest year, over -financed. This indicates that they have mor e long -term  resources as fixed asset that is owned by the business subject.   Given the fact that the business subject disposes of approximately the same fixed asset  value, the size of difference is conditional mostly on equity development and by accruals. T he  highest negative value was reached by the business subject in 2010 due to a high level item of  deferred long -term earnings. From this year the value of the golden statistic rose slightly. In the  latest year the indicator’s value reached a negative value due to the merge r of the monitored  business subject with a minor business subject, resulting in high growth of fixed asset s mostly  in the form of buildings and non -fixed assets.        2.4.2 Net working capital   In table 5 (see below Tab. 5 below) the indicator values of net working capital  by the  monitored business subject for each year are listed.      -20 000 000-15 000 000-10 000 000-5 000 00005 000 00010 000 00015 000 00020 000 00025 000 000 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014Fixed assets Long- term obligations Golden statistic rule87   Tab. 5  Indicator s of net working capital     2009  2010  2011  2012  2013  2014   CA 19 403 638 28 020 007  17 872 437  37 793 178  25 639 724  18 248 631   SO 11 580 734  14 044 305  6 279 600  27 077 378  21 365 752  20 445 240   CA- SO=NWC  7 822 904  13 975 702  11 592 837  10 715 800  4 273 972  -2 196 609   Source: own research   In graph 5 the indicator development of net working capital by the monitored business subject  is graphically displayed.     Graph 5  Indicator s of net working capital     Source: own research   From the viewpoint of a comparison with net working capital we can state that NWC has  a natural reverse correlation  with the golden statistic rule. In the business subject until 2012 ,  current asset s exceeded short -term obligations. This fact from the business subject’s point of  view is judged as positive, because in the case of necessity , the business subject is able to  reimburse their obligations by current asset s, which testifies of their good financial situation.  According to graph 5 we can conclude that this value from 2010 decreases due to the decline  of incomplete production and blank stock. In 2012, 2013 and 2014 the decline is also caused  by the increase of business relation ship obligations. In the last reporting  year,  2014 , the net  working capital reached  negative values. Based on this , arises slight ly unfunded debt, wh ich is  for the business subject a warning signal, because in the need for repay ment  of short -term  obligations, they would be forced to sell part of their fixed asset s and thereby would be forced  to influence the business subject’s operations.     2.5 Indebtedness indicators of monitored business subject   By means of these indicators, we look at the financial structure and indebtedness of the  business subject and its indeb tedness repayment ability. The results are shown in table 6 below.

Graph 6 Indicators of indebtedness     Source: (Pastýr, 2014 , 74)  Total assets indebtedness during our 6 year reporting period showed  a fluctuating character.  Their values are in the range from 50.08 up to 67.01. For the optimal total indebtedness is  considered the value 50  %. The company was the closest to this point in 2011 with the value  50.08. They were the most in debt in 2012 with the value 67.01 mainly due to the increase of  time differentiation or profits from future long -term periods.   The coefficient of self -financing is directly related to total assets  indebtedness, which  assesses the field from the point of view of the company’s owners and its sum is  made of                     100 %. Thus its development is the opposite and equally volatile to total asset  indebtedness.  The business subject was the most financially independent in 2011 with 49.92 .   Immediately in the first reporting year the indicator o f insolvency ha d the highest value of 2.04,  from which we can judge that the business subject had issues surrounding  its own activity,  whereas its liabilities to receivables were  higher by more than twice and it s the initial insolvency  mainly due to short -term trade receivables. The business subject entered secondary insolvency  in 2011, when the indicator’s value was 0.91 due to a slight increase of short -term receivables  and decrease of short -term liabilities from trade.   In 2012 the credit indebtedness was a  decreasing trend. The highest financing of foreign  sources through bank loans was reported  in the first reporting year of 2009 with 19.14  %. In  2012 they reached the lowest value of only 0.80  % due to an increase of time differentiation  item profits from future long -term periods.   The interest coverage after 2013 showed an increasing trend . Its value increases  exponentially, which can also be seen on the graph. In 2009 this indicator reached the value  only of 3.94, wh ich was caused by low pre-tax trading income and higher interest expense. In  2013 this indicator increased to 105.71 and in 2013 to a value of 244.30, which was mainly due  to high trade income before tax and low interest expense. This implies that the company covers  their interests with its  profit without any issues.   The indebtedness flow has a fluctuating trend . In 2009 and 2010 this indicator increases to  the value of 11.50. Afterwards  the indicator’s decline until 2013, when the business subject  0,0050,00100,00150,00200,00250,00 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014Total debt assets Coefficient of self- financing Credit indebtedness Interest coverage Flow debt89   would pay its liabilities (debts) at the fo rmation of cash flow of 3.31 per year. Already in the  last reporting year only a slight decrease occurred .    3. PROPOSAL FOR IMPROVE MENTS OF MONITORED B USINESS SUBJECT´S  SELECTED RATIO INDICATORS OF  FINANCIAL -ECONOMIC ANALYSIS     After the processing of financial -economic analysis several weaknesses of the business  subject have been revealed. In the synthesis of this information and following induction we can  generali se some measures for long - term successful operation of the business subjec t. It is the  incorporation of the following measures.     3.1 The activity ratio indicator of the monitored business subject   At the time of stock turnover we propose continuous stock monitoring to prevent the  adverse ly high inventory. As well in the future we propose some optimi sation of stock flow  management in relation to production or its improved procurement from various suppliers,  storage and use through a precise time system, motion planning in parallel with produ ction  needs.   The time of short -term receivables collection can enable further possible business  development within fair trade and good customer -supplier relationships . I see the possibility of  improvement or the volume and frequency of short - term receivab les reduction as well as the  time period of their reimbursement in the incentives of customers themselves through the  provision of cash discount, price discounts for payment before the due date of the relevant  receivable and thereby ensuring stabili sation or receivables turnover time reduction.   A further possibility to decrease the short -term receivables collection is to introduce a strict  internal control system in issuing e.g. customer invoices in the form of rescheduling.   To ensure the timely payment of  receivables of less responsible customers it is necessary  to apply the reminders notice mechanism or sanctioning for non -compliance of contractual  conditions of payment.   In the case of receivables management improvement the acquired financial sources cou ld  be used to reduce the size as well as the short -term liabilities time period of the business subject  from trade by invoice reimbursement from their suppliers to maturity or sooner, or reducing the  need to use short - term bank loans.   The long - term asset  turnover has significant different values, thus I recommend that the  business subject uses their long -term asset s more effectively.   By decreasing the stock turnover time period ensures the greater production flexibility,  because the high volume of stocks  binds unnecessary finances that could be invested into other  business areas e.g. into its development, moderni sation and etc.   By reducing the short - term receivables time period through using a cash discount or price  discounts for payment before maturity of the receivable will lead to a  decline of unliquidated  short -term receivables in the business subject. This allows further use of cashed financial  sources e.g. the earlier payment of short -term liabilities of the business subject or reducing the  need to use short -term bank loans. In the supplier this motivational tool can induce the  willingness on his part to closer cooperat e under favourable  conditions. The introduction of an  internal control system in issuing of customer invoices timeliness and excellen ce may ensured  this. 90   The decline of the short -term liabilities time period or proper and timely payment of  liability to a supplier can creat e between him and the business subject a favourable  and  competitive supplier -customer relationship that can be in the future reflected e.g. in material  supply for more favourable  quantitative and price conditions.     3.2 The profitability ratio indicator of the monitored business subject   We can state that th e results of profitability indicators have positive values. That means the  business subject achieves continuous profit. Almost all these indicators in a period of six years  achieved within the recent two years a slight downward trend. The interests of the business  subject is to stabili se or to increase these values. Therefore a continuous monitoring of  indicators of sales and profit  is required , to increase the level of these indicators. These  objectives can be achieved by the following measures:    by a flexible pricing policy,    by improving the efficiency of the marketing mix,    by efforts to win new customers and cheaper suppliers,    by investing in financial market products for example in bonds and funds.   On the other hand, to prevent further decline of the business subject’s profit, it is required  to secure the economy and efficiency by optimi sation of costs and by individual asset items  utilisation. It is mainly the following cost items:    the cost of material and energy consumption,   - by applying new prod uction technologies and the use of new or innovated  technology,    - by improving work organi sation and production management in the form of  production process harmoni sation, production capacity utili sation,   - by raising the educational level of employees,    the reduction of personnel costs,   - by standardi sed work of production employees,   - by optimi sation of overhead employees,   - by optimi sation of technical and administrative employees.     Following the introduction of design measures there is a premise of the business subject s  economic result increase for the accounting period as well as the increase of the revenue  indicator s. The business subject will accomplish a stabili sed position on the market by obtaining  new and more advantageous financial relationships.  As well higher profitability and more  efficient capital utili sation for business subject’s owners will be accomplished by reali sation of  the mentioned measures.   By optimi sation of costs the business subject will secure their decrease and at the same  time will create conditions for the implementation of innovative and new technologies and  techni ques that should be introduced  to employees on the appropriate educational level.     3.3 The ratio and differential liquidity indicator of the monitored business subje ct  In 2012 , the value of the golden statistic rule indicator for the monitored business subject  registered growth due to the merge r of two business subjects and the growth of current asset s.  The value of this indicator thus reached a  positive value that means the business subject is  under -financed. As a result of this adverse situation, three  ways of this value reduction are  proposed:  91    by increase  of their fixed resources of settlement by raising their equity through basic  capital incr ease in the form of share issue,    by bond issue,    by increase of their external sources through obtaining of long -term bank loan.   Within the monitored business subject the current asset s exceeds short -term obligations.  The exception of this is the latest yea r, therefore we propose towards the future period to  increase the business subject ’s liquidity by increasing the volume of their current financial  asset s:   by reducing the time of debt collection from business relations (by discount, by  monitoring, by mecha nism of reminders, by penalties),    by reduction of supplement turnover time (better supplement management),    by advance charge on customi sed production,    by sale of surplus asset s, but this asset change could result in a lower ability for further  business activities development in the future.     After the implementation of submitted proposals for increas ing the business subject’s  liquidity, there is the premise of a business subject’s solvency increase while the conditions for  balanced development are created. The business subject will have the necessary financial  resources and will be able to reimburse on time their short -term obligations with their financial  resources as well as be able to use them for further development.     3.4 The indebtedness ratio indicator of the monitored business subject   Undertaking in relation to business activity , the business subject has acceptable values of  total indebtedness as well as the self -financing coefficient, thus I do recommend to monitor,  maintain and not to exceed  this state or this indebtedness rate.   Regarding the insolvency indicator the business subject is primarily located in insolvency,  therefore I recommend that the business subject shall try to reduce the level of a short -term  liabilities.   After the incorpo ration of measures the level of equity and foreign capital will stabili se and  the overall stability will be ensured. The business subject will seem more attractive in the  provision of loans as well as in individual investments.     CONCLUSION     In the present turbulent competitive environment the financial analysis is an essential part  of monitoring the business subject and is an important tool to support the decision making of  various stakeholder groups. Also it provides a picture or feedback about the whole c ondition of  business subject and their development and about a condition of individual operation areas.  This analysis is able to identify factors that with the largest stake have caused undesirable  results within the business subject. Through prediction mo dels of financial -economic analysis  the business subject is able to predict their future development and possible option for  bankruptcy.   Among the benefits of this article belongs financial -economic analysis focused on the  business subject’s ratio indicato rs of activity, profitability, liquidity and indebtedness itself.   Related proposals mentioned in this article for weaknesses elimination which  were found by  financial analysis are focused on practical use in the business subject’s experience.     92   Note   The contribution was written within the framework of a research project VEGA 1/0218/16 on  ""The Model of the implementation of controlling as a management tool within medium  enterprises in the engineering and electronics industries"".

The business enterprise  can, as a result,  create variations of how to approach the  new complex and changing situations of success in the market. Therefore managers are trying  during negative times to  change their management approach, to ensure long -term and stable  running of the business enterpri se. They are forced to continuously maintain and obtain  customers and suppliers. By implementing these measures they have the opportunity to achieve  a competitive advantage over other business enterprises .     Key words     Financial analysis, company, profit , activity, profitability, liquidity, indebtedness     INTRODUCTION   In a global market economy that is determined by its constant uncertainty, the business  enterprises  are faced with  demanding economic conditions . They are exposed to constant  changes of environment as well as uncompromised pressure of competitors, who are trying  every day to increase the quality of their products and services and continuously to progress  ahead. This fact results in a negative impact  on the whole performance of the business subject.   The business subject, in order to be able to maintain a stable and competitive position on  the market, to provide inputs for the management, to make important strategic decisions and to  achieve their econo mic goals, is forced to constantly analyse  and monitor their financial  situation with which appears towards financial subjects and the surrounding’s situation. A  principal factor of effective financial management consist  SLOVAK UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY  in Bratislava , s of financial situation knowledge. For this purpose the financial analysis is used.  With it the business subject will be capable to prevent the crisis, which would lead to  remediation or even to bankruptcy.  74     OBJECTIVE     The objective of this ar ticle is to provide  basic knowledge about financial analysis ex -post  and subsequently to evaluate the business subject progress in an area of activity, liquidity  profitability and indebtedness, to reveal strengths and opportunities that the business subject  should rely on . Furthermore, it also aims to  determine weaknesses and threats that could lead  them to difficult situations and based on the results to provide measures to improve the system  of financial economic analysis of the business subject.     METHODS     In th is article the basic scientific methods used were  analysis, synthesis, induction,  deduction and hypothesis  creation . A synthesis of theory and knowledge will serve to obtain  the theoretical basis to meet the set objective. The analysis will f ocus on the financial statements  of a public limited company w hich produc es equipment and components for the mining,  chemical and energy industries, as well as boat and marine components. From the results of the  analysis , by induction, deduction and hypoth esis creation, we shall draw conclusions and  suggest actions for improvement of the business subject’s financial and economic analysis  system.     1. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF THE SELECTED COMPANY     The financial situation of the business subject is considered to be  a complex output of their  whole performance. This output is presented through the ratio indicators of activity,  profitability, liquidity, indebtedness and market value. These indicators are based on the  synthetic indicators of financial accounting and they  demonstrate the complexity of the business  subject’s performance interpretation  (Baran  and Pastýr , 2014, 6) .    1.1 Financial analysis  - Ex post   A financial situation analysis is the foundation of the company’s economic performance  analysis and usually proceeds down to primary fields and results as effectivity, efficiency,  production capacity utilisation , supplement management and the like. Financial analysis detect s  weaknesses  and strengths of the comp any, is the tool of “health” diagnostics and provides  essential information to business management and to owners (Vlachynský, 2009, 369) .  Sedláček understands the financial analysis of the company as a method of the company’s  financial management evaluatio n, during  which the data obtained is graded, aggregated  and  compared to each other . Furthermore,  the relationships between them are quantified, looking  for the causal connection between the data and their development  is determined . This increases  the explanatory power of data processing and its informative value. Thus it focuses on  identifying problems, strengths, weaknesses and foremost the company’s value processes.  Information obtained through financial analysis enables us to re ach some conclusions about  general management and the financial situation of the company and represents a background  for management decision making (Sedláček, 2009, 3) .   The main purpose of financial analysis is to express assets and the financial position  of the  company and to prepare the inputs for internal management decision making. The c omplexity  and continuous execution are the essential requirements of financial analysis (Hrdý, 2009, 118) . 75   The c ompany’s financial situation is diverse and a multifacet ed complex phenomenon;  consequently this diversity is transferred also into the financial analysis process. The user of  the financial analysis results decides which  indicator’s to select and the priority of utili sation of  individual parts of the financial analysis according to demand and intention (Baran et. al , 2011) .  Among primary users of the financial analysis we might include various subjects mainly  as  owners, managers, employees, lenders (suppliers, banks), debtors (customers), institutions  of state and public administration, external analytics, media and etc (Baran, 2008) .  The review of the company’s financial situation is declared by the system of financial  indicators, which have to be in order and designed to reflect all the important aspects of the  financial situation. Therefore, for a description of the financial situation the ratio indicators are  used. The ratio indicators enable a comparative  analys is of the company with other companies  or with indicators for the relevant area. The s um of ratio indicators we’ll present, can be  considered as the sum of representative indicators. Specifically, these will be the most  commonly used indicat ors of the financial situation  characteristics . However, along with the  practical application , dozens of indicators are used, and it is not possible to mention  all of them  (Baran, 20 15).   In practice , the use of several basic indicators has been proven rel evant which can be  categorised  into groups according to individual areas of management evaluation and the  financial health of the company. Mostly these are groups of indicator s such  as debt, liquidity,  profitability, activity, capital market indicators, as well as other indicators (Knapková, 2013,  84).  Based on the objectives that have been set within this article, we’ll provide more detail on  the ratio indicator s of profitability an d liquidity.     1.1.1 Financial analysis - Indicators of activity   The activity indicators are used for business asset management, because they evaluate how  effectively a business subject manages their assets . A business subject rates the commitment of  indivi dual items of the capital in certain forms of assets . If the business subject may have more  assets  than is appropriate , then unnecessary costs are incur red and the profit is adjusted. In  contrast , if the business subject may have few assets  the possible in comes may be lost  (Baran,  2015) .  When applying indicators of activity we see a problem in the work with flows and stocks.  While the balance sheet represents assets and liabilities at a particular point in time, the profit  and loss statement records the cos ts and revenues continuously over the year. Therefore, when  working with those indicators it is necessary due to the least possible deviation from the actual  that the calculation shows the average of individual balance sheets items (Pastýr , 2014 ).  The t ime of stock turnover testifies how many days does a stock turnover take. In other  words, it indicates the time that is required for the transition of financial resources through  production and products back into the form of money. The ideal situation is w hen the business  subject over time shows a decreasing value of this indicator. A short time (time scale) is usually  the expression of greater efficiency. However, it is necessary to take into account the nature of  the business. Alternatively, in the denomi nator instead of revenues the costs can be used.     stock  turnover =average  stock revenuesx 365   76   The receivables turnover tells how long the business assets hang in the form of receivables  or in how long time the receivables are paid on average. The recommend ed value is obviously  the standard time period of invoices maturity, because most of the consigned products are  invoiced and each invoice has its maturity. If the time period of receivables turnover has been  longer than the standard time period of invoices  maturity that would mean failure to comply  with the trade credit policy from business partners. However, at present it is quite common that  the time of invoices payment exceeds the declared. Definitely, in this case it is important to take  into considerat ion what is the size of the analysed  company. For small businesses the longer  period of receivables maturity may cause significant financial issues with the possibility of  bankruptcy. While large businesses are from the financial point of view more able to  tolerate  longer period of maturity. The time horizon, which could be considered as optimal, should also  meet the criteria of business commercial policy (Růčková, 2005, 122) .    receivables  turnover =average  stock  of short −term  receivables revenuesx 365    The maturity of short -term liabilities reflects the time of incurrence until its payment. This  indicator should reach at least the values of receivables turnover maturity. The indicators of  receivables turnover maturity and the liabilities turnover maturit y are important for assessing  the timing differences from the inception of receivables until their collections and from  incurring of liabilities until the payment. This difference directly influences the business  liquidity. As far as the turnover , the time of commitment is greater than the sum of stock and  receivables turnover, the suppliers credits finance receivables and stock, which  is preferable.  However, it may reflect low liquidity levels. Between the level of liquidity and activity is a  close connect ion and a certain compromise should be looked for (Knapková, 2013, 105) .    liabilities  turnover =average  stock  of short −term  liabilities revenuesx 365    The long -term asset  turnover is relevant in decision -making to determine whether to procure  the next long-term production asset. A lower value of the indicator than the average in the field  is a signal for production to increase capacity utili sation and for financial managers to reduce  business investments (Sedláček, 2001,  61).     long −term  asset  turnover =revenue average  stock  of long −term  assets    In general , with  asset  turnover , it applies that the larger the value of the indicator, the more  positively the situation is asse ssed. A minimal recommended value of this indicator is 1. Yet  the value is influenced  by the industry as well. A low value of indicator means a  disproportionate business subject’s asset facilities and its inefficient use (Knapková, 2013,  104).    asset  turnover =revenues average  stock  of assets    In this case, it is possible to substitute the r evenues with the profits, though the result may be  overestimated due to different types of income that are not related to the main business activity. 77   It is appropriate to use the sale or revenues from the sales of  ones own products and services or  to combi ne both kinds of profits (Knapková, 2013, 104) .    1.1.2 Financial analysis - Indicators of profitability     The indicators of profitability, sometimes referred to as indicators of profit, return,  profitability ratio, are designed as a ratio of the final effect achieved by business activity  (output) to some comparative base (input) that can be on the side of assets  as well as on the side  of liabilities , or to another base. These indicators display the positive or also negative influence  on asset  management, the business subject’s financing and liquidity on profitability  (Kislingerová, 2007, 83) .  All indicators of profitability have a similar interpretation, because they specify how much  EUR of revenues (the numerator) cases per 1 EUR of i ndicator mentioned in the denominator.  Because there exists a multitude of profitability ratio indicators; we’ll address only those that  are the most important. Altogether we’ll approach the explanatory power of selected and  mentioned indicators. In this a rticle we’ll mention the following, in practice most frequently  used indicators of profitability (Baran, 2015) .  A return on sales indicator explains to us, how is the business subject able to use inputs for  their effective operations. The final value of this indicator is directly influenced by the character  of the business activity, price policy, production regulation, etc. A more accurate statement of  this type of indi cator provides us a ratio of partial results of the business subject’s management  to their revenues (Baran, 201 5).    return  on sales =net income income x 100  operating  return  on sales =operating  profit income x 100    share  of added  value  in revenues =added  value income x 100    The profitability indicator (return of income) of total capital compares the result of business  activity with the volume of invested capital (Farkašová, 2007, 42) . This indicator specifies the  assessment of total capital, the business subject  has used for their activity. By assessment of the  capital part of the equity, is a process of profit distribution after tax. It is possible for the  business subject to execute the profit distribution after tax, but not until the general assembly  approves the following:   - to increase capital,   - to subsidi se funds from revenues,   - to retain the profit after tax undistributed or   - to repay dividends (in the case of plc).   By valori sation of capital, the business subject is commissioned to pay back part of the  capital  to the lender. Professional literature states an indicator level reference not to be higher  than the interest rate of long -term loans.     return  on assets  (ROA )=net profit assets x 100   78   A return on equity is essential for the business subject’s owners and for lenders has a  supporting meaning. In general , the value of indicators should be higher than the interest rate  of risk -free bonds (Černá, 1997, 73) .     return  on equity  (ROE )=net profit equity x 100    The level of return on equity is strongly dependent on the return on assets and on the interest  rate of borrowed capital. The increase of the indicator ROE mostly depends on the level of the  business subject’s created profit, on a drop in interest rate of the borrowed capital, on a decline  in the equity’s share on a business subject’s return on assets and a combination of all previous  factors (Baran, 201 5).    1.1.3 Financial analysis - Indicator of liquidity   Liquidity is a combination  of all potential liquid resources that are available for the  company to meet their payment obligations. According to professional literature solvency is  defined as the readiness of the business subject to undertake payment of their obligations at the  time of their reimbursement and therefore is one of the basic conditions of the company’s  successful existence (Sedláček, 2009, 66) .   We can conclude that there exists mutual conditioning of liquidity indicators and solvency.  The condition of solvency is to att ain that the business subject would have part of the assets  bond ed to the available assets, which are disposable to obligations for reimbursement in the  form of short -term financial asset s- mostly bank accounts. Furthermore , we are able to conclude  that th e condition of solvency is liquidity. The indicators of liquidity are put into the ratio : the  individual short -term financial assets against short -term obligations. Indicators of liquidity  engage into the most liquid part of the business subject’s assets  and are divided according to  level of liquidity of individual assets , which are mentioned in the numerator of financial  statements - the balance sheet. The disadvantage of indicators is that these indicators evaluate  liquidity according to balances of short -term asset s (current assets) which on the other hand  mainly depends on future cash -flow (Baran  and Pastyr , 2014, 9) .  Liquidity of the 1st level shows, how many times the short -term financial asset s (current  assets ) covers the  short -term obligations of the business subject. This means, how many times  is the business subject able to satisfy their lenders, if they would convert some of the short -  term asset s (current assets) items instantly into available assets (Baran, 2015, 10) .   For the success of the company it is essential to pay short -term obligations from those  assets  that are designated for this purpose (Valach, 1999, 109) . The 1st level liquidity indicator  has its meaning foremost for the lenders of business subject’s short -term obligations and  provides information of the extent to which the short -term components of capital (borrowed  capital) covers the value of the asset, because lenders undertake some risk, which is, that their  claim won’t be reimbursed. The higher the value of the 1st level liqu idity indicator is, in general,  the more likely is the business subject’s solvency is ensured.   This characteristic is only really a rough sketch, because it s explanatory ability further  depends on the current assets structure, liquidity of individual kind s of current assets and as  well on the type of industry the company operates in (Valach, 1999, 109) .    1st level  liquidity  =current  financial  assets short −term  foreign  sources   79   For coverage of the business subject’s short -term obligations , can be used the immediate  financial resources that are available on bank accounts and in treasury as well as expected  financial resources of not yet refunded short -term obligations. This relationship gives us  liquidity of the 2nd level. As professional li terature states, the recommended values should be  located within interval 1 - 1.5.       2nd  level  liquidity  =current  financial  assets +short −term  obligations short −term  foreign  sources    Liquidity of the 3rd level determines  the ability of the company to pay their obligations to  short -term borrowed capital throug h the current asset s. This means that the company does have  enough short -term resources to manage their regular operation. The optimal i nterval is 1.5 to a  max of 2.5 and in comparison t o the liquidity of 1st or 2nd level is increased for the reasons of  lower liquidity of supplies. The short -term borrowed capital shouldn’t exceed 40 % of the  current asset value  (Kotulič, 2010, 60) .    3rd level  liquidity =current  assets short −term  foreign  sources    Current asset s includes the sum of current financial asset s, short -term receivables and  supplies. Permanent solvency is one of the basic conditions of the business subject’s successful  existence within the market conditions. Thus, the probability of  its maintenance is a reasonable  part of the global characteristic of the business subject’s financial health.      1.1.4 Financial analysis - Horizontal liquidity   A very important task within liquidity analysis is horizontal liquidity. The horizontal  liquidity examines the mutual context and relations among items of assets and items of capital  in financial statements - the balance sheet. The c urrent asset s of the business subject should be  covered by short -term resou rces (Baran  and Pastyr , 2014, 8) .    1.1.4.1 Golden statistic rule   Every kind of asset should be financed by the source of the asset with the reimbursement  period (liquidity) that corresponds to the period of effective use of relevant asset. This fact is  considered as the basic finance management rule and is called the golden statistic rule  (Šlosárová, 2006, 351) .  The golden statistic rule requires that the source coverage of long -term asset s (LA) is long- term sources coverage (LC). This means that the financial resources won’t be available for  shorter than the commitment of equity participation, for which this serves. A relationship  between long -term asset s and long - term sources can be in this case t hreefold (Kotulič, 2010):    LC < LC, or LA – LC < 0 => company is pre -financed,    LA > LC, or LA – LC > 0 => company is under -financed,    LA = LC, or LA – LC = 0 => company asset s are optimally financed.   Balance equilibrium, which has to be preserved in the balance sheet, results in these  relationships having an  effect on the current asset s and its finance. The c urrent asset s (CA)  should be covered mostly by current sources (CS). The difference between CA and CS is called  a NET working capital.  80   1.1.4.2 NET working capital   The net working capital is an indicator, which reconstructs part of the current asset s  (current assets ) that is financed by long -term financial resources, either by equity or by  borrowed capital. The business subject’s net working capital e nables in theory a case that the  business subject in real time is obligated to reimburse a significant proportion of their short - term obligations, which form a meaningful source of their funding to further operate. The  overload of current asset s towards sh ort-term obligations demonstrates to us that the business  subject is from the point of view of current liquidity liquid. This means that the business subject  has a financial background in the form of long -term financial resources. (Baran, 2015)   NWC = curre nt assets  – short -term obligations   where NWC is the net working capital.   1.1.5 Financial analysis - Indicators of indebtedness   The term of indebtedness expresses the fact that the company finances their assets  by  foreign sources. By using foreign sources the company affects both the profitability of  shareholders as well as the business risk. Today, it’s practically pointless for large sized  companies to finance all their assets  from equity or vice versa only fro m foreign capital. By  using only equity would result in an overall return on invested capital reduction within the  company. On the other hand, financing of all business activities only by foreign capital is  excluded, because within the legal regulations a certain mandatory amount of equity to start a  business is bound. Therefore, in business finance  activities its own as well as foreign capital are  implicated. The main motive of financing their activities by foreign capital is the relatively low  price compa red to its own resources. The involvement of foreign sources in business financing  enables reduce costs for the use of capital in the company (Kislingerová, 2007, 96) .  Although the theory of refer red higher cost of equity compared to foreign capital is  questionable , at the present time of low interest rates it seems to be more advantageous to use   ones own equity unless the company or shareholders have it at their disposal.   The indicator of total indebtedness, which is expressed by the ratio of foreign sour ces to  overall assets  further expresses to what extent the assets of the company include foreign  sources. The creditors do not prefer too high a proportion of debt. Rather they favour a lower  proportion of debt. This gives them greater  assurance  that in th e case of the company’s  liquidation their receivables will be more likely satisfied. For the owners , the foreign sources  are less expensive than their own and at a higher debt rate the profitability of capital is increased.  The optimal value of this indica tor for the production company is 40  % up to 60  % (Farkašová,  2007, 39) .    total  indebtedness =foreign  sources assetsx 100    To measure the indebtedness , a ratio of equity to total assets is used.   - coefficient of self -financing, which is a complementary indicator ( self -financing) and their  sum with total indebtedness should give 100  %. This indicator expresses the proportion, in  which the assets  of the company are financed by shareholders’ finances. It is considered as  one of the most important ratios of indebtedness for the overall financial situation  assessment . Yet once again the relation ship with the profitability indicator is important   (Růčková, 200 5, 117) .  coefficient  of self −financing =equity assetsx 100 81   Insolvency notes the relation ship between items - assets and liabilities. If the resulting value  is greater than 1, it is a so -called primary insolvency and if the value is less than 1, we’re talking  about so -called secondary insolvency of the company (Farkašová, 2007 , 40).  insolvency =short −term  liabilities short −term  receiveblesx 100    Credit indebtedness is interpreted as a mutual relation ship between bank loans and  overdrafts in the numerator and fore ign sources located in the denominator. The resulting  relation ship is expressed in a percentage  (Pastýr , 2014 ).   credit  indebtedness =bank  loans  and overdrafts foreign  sourcesx 100  The indicator of interest coverage expresses the number of times the profit is higher than  the paid interest. Hence this indicator is used by the company to determine whether the debt  burden is feasible. It informs shareholders about the company’s ability to pay interests and  creditors about whether and how to ensure their rights in the case of the company’s liquidation.  The inability to pay the interests payments from the profit can predict approaching business  bankruptcy. If the value of this indicator re aches a value of 1, the entire profit would cover the  interest expense. Thus it is recommended that the value of the indicator is higher than 3 (Hrdý,  2009, 130) .    interest  coverage =economic  result  before  tax+interest  expense interest  expense    The indebtedn ess flow tells about the value of commitment in terms of total annual cash  flow of the company. This indirectly implies about the time required to cover the debts from  the annual perspective, where the entire value is considered 100  %. Usually it is requir ed that  the repayment of debt is not longer than 3 years (Farkašová, 2007,  40).    indebtedness  flow =foreign  sources cash  flow    The indebtedness is not always a negative characteristic  of the company. Nevertheless, the  higher the debt, the greater the business risk and the harder it is to obtain foreign sources of  financing foremostly to get a loan from a bank  (Šlosárová, 2006, 345) .    2. RESULTS AND DISCUSSI ON    In this chapter we interp ret the financial -economic analysis of assets , liquidity, profitability  and indebtedness , the golden statistic rule or the net working capital in the specific example of  the following business subject. The research consists of results from the calculations, graphs  and following the course and trend evaluation of the monitored indicators. The data for  financial -economic analysis has been derived from financial statements as the balance sheet,  and profit and loss account. For the cause of relevance we used the statements, reports dated  from 2009 till 2014.      82   2.1 Activity indicators of the monitored business subject     In the next subchapter we’ll look how a business subject manages  its assets and what is its  effectiveness. The exact values of the analysed  indicators and their development can be seen in  Table 1 and Graph 1 (see Tab. 1 and Graph 1 below).

Graph 1  Indicators of activity     Source: (Pastýr, 2014,  73)  The values of assets  turnover through the analysed  period  both increased and decreased .  The highest value the company recorded in 2013 i.e. 1.44. The weakest asset use of the business  subject has been reached in 2011 with the value 1.07. This result has been mostly affected by  an item production in progress and semi -finished products with the value € 3,418,601, which  entered in the following year the highest value € 20,425,932. With the decline of production in  progress als o the profits decreased, which in 2011 have been the lowest during the reporting  period. This implies that the business subject had during  this time issues with contracts, which  has been proved as well by employment decline from 477 to 307. In the last yea r the indicator  declined slightly due to the growth of long -term fixed asset s.  The long -term asset turnover has the same development as total assets  turnover, though the  differences between the values are greater. Fixed asset s had approximately the same va lue, but  is worth noting that in 2013 the value is € 8,719,077 and in 2014, the value is € 26,737,025.  The difference between them was due to constructions and separate movable assets and sets of  movable assets, which grew from the merge r of the analysed  business subject with SAM by the  E.S.C.B, Inc. Bratislava. The indicator reaches its lowest value in 2011 at 3.48. In this year, as  we already stated, the decline of profits from sales of their own products and services occurred.   0,0020,0040,0060,0080,00100,00120,00 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014Inventory turnover Short-term receivables collection period The maturity of short-term liabilities Fixed assets turnover Total assets turnover83   The indicator of the stock turnover time period has fluctuating values  by 6 months . The  peak was reached in 2011 of 113 days. This long stock turnover was been mainly caused by the  decline of material and production in progress and semi -finished products. In this year the  revenues d ecreased by about € 10,960,961. The ideal situation is to achieve the minimum of  this indicator, which occurred  in 2013, when the stock turnover amounted to 83.75 days.   The receivables and stock turnover time period show  similar trends . The lowest value was  reached in 2013, when the short -term receivables collection period was 72.60 days and maturity  of short -term liabilities was 82.89 days. In every reporting year we can see that the short -term  receivables collection had a lower value than the maturity of short -term liabilities. For the  business subject this state is of a positive nature, because it expresses that the customers repay  their debts before the business subject repays its liabilities.   2.2 Profitability indicators of the mon itored business subject     The indicators of profitability are designed as the business subject’s economic result rate  (output) to a comparative item (input). These indicators tell us at what level is the business  subject able to reach profit with the help of the capital  used. In table 2 (see Tab. 2 below) the  profitability indicators values are shown.

This was caused by a larger  amount of orders and subsequently the increase of supplies at the date of the report compilation.  In the following two years this value decreased due to a slight change of sales return state which  stabili sed to the level 11.18 % and 11.68 %.    The return on sale s shows a similar trend to the operating return on sale s. Until  2012 the  operating return on sale s has shown an increase , when the indicator reached almost 17.65 %  mainly due to the lower return on sale s of their own products and services and due to higher  profit from business activity  operations . In the last two years the income from operations  stabili sed yet the revenues incr eased, which caused the indicator to decrease to 13.90 % and to  13.74 %.   Once again, in 2012, the share of added value to revenues , displayed  the highest value  at  35.90 %, which for the business subject over the last  6 years was the most successful. Within  the next  two years , a lower value occurred mainly due to change of revenues size from the sale  of their products and services. The i ndicator shows  overall positive progress.   The p ositive profitability of the total ca pital reflects  the production power, and provides   details about the effective asset utili sation and thus the assets of the business subject. This  indicator has been increasing every year and the highest value reached in 2013 of 16.50 %. In  the following year, only a small decline to 14.03 % occurred mainly due to the merge r with a  minor business subject and due to the increase in fixed assets of land, buildings and non -fixed  assets.     Return on equity invested  by the owners into the business, reache d a positive value as well,  which is a positive signal for the business subject’s owners. It is worth not ing 2013, in which  the return on equity reached  the level of 45.59 %. This was caused by a decrease of retained  earnings, wh ich means, that the profit was r edistributed among owners of the public limited  company via dividends reimbursement.    In the latest  year the return on equity value declined to 31.14 % due to capital funds  subsid ies.    2.3 Liquidity indicators of the monitored business subject   The business subject’s ability to repay their obligations is a necessary factor for a long- term successful venture. Therefore constant monitoring is important by both the business  subject and by external users, who could cooperate with the business subject  or that already  cooperate with them. In table 3 (see Tab. 3 below) the values of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd level liquidity  indicators are shown.     Tab. 3  Indicators of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd level of liquidity    m. u  2009  2010  2011  2012  2013  2014   Liquidity of  1st level  coef.  0,15 0,14 0,31 0,23 0,04 0,07  Liquidity of  2nd level  coef.  0,69 0,97 1,68 0,51 0,87 0,52  Liquidity of  3rd level  coef.  1,68 2,00 2,85 1,40 1,20 0,89  Source: (Pastýr, 2014, 71)     Graph 3 shows the monitored business subject’s indicators for the  1st, 2nd and 3rd level of  liquidity.      85   Graph 3  Indicators of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd level of liquidity     Source: (Pastýr, 2014, 71)     According to the recommended range for engineering business subjects indicated by  professional literature the values of the 1st level of liquidity should vary from 0.2 to 0.6. When  looking at the table, it is visible that the values of the monitored business subject are ge nerally  much lower and they don’t reach the recommended value . This tells us about the business  subject’s inability to instantly refund their short -term obligations. The lowest rate that the  indicator has registered was during  the most recent two years, wh en the values reached 0.04  and 0.07 %. These low values were mainly caused by an increase of obligations from business  relations hips and an increase of obligations  towards the owners. Two exceptions can be taken  as a positive fact and that is 2011 with a value of 0.31 and 2012 with a value of 0.23.  The 2nd  level of liquidity should vary within an  interval of 1-1.5. Within this range only the value 1.68  achieved in 2011 is located. In recent years , the values were lower than the interval limit 1. The  lowest value 0.51 was reached in 2012. This value was largely influenced by accruals, more  accurately, by short - term deferred revenues, which reached up 17  400 198 €. From these values  we can assume that the business s ubject besides in 2011 didn’t have the ability to refund their  short -term obligations with their short -term receivables. Also in the case of a need to repay their  short -term obligations the business subject would have to proceed with a change of less liqui d  asset s to more liquid asset s. For the  3rd level of liquidity the business subject’s supplies were  included. The r ecommended values should vary between  2 and 2.5. Within this range falls 2010  with the value 2 and 2011 with the value up to 2.85. For some p ositive fact we can consider  that the business subject has their 3rd level liquidity over the value of 1, which creates a situation,  in which they are able to repay their short -term obligations with their current asset s. The  indicator’s lowest value is achieved by the business subject in 2014 at 0.89 due to changes of  several items of production in the progress decline, blank stock, business relation ship  receivables, the increase in other current reserves and liabilities  towards partners.     2.4 Horizontal liquidity of the monitored business subject   In the following part of the article we  will outline  the achieved values of different  indicators, the golden statistic rule and the net working capital of the business subject.       0,000,501,001,502,002,503,00 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014Liquidity of  1st level Liquidity of  2nd level Liquidity of  3rd level86   2.4.1 Golden statistic rule   In table 4 (see Tab. 4 below) the values of the golden statistic rule indicator of the monitored  business subject for each year are shown.

Graph 4  Indicator of the golden statistic rule in €     Source: own research    A view of the business subject’s long -term funding displays the golden statistic rule. From  graph 4 it is clearly seen that the business subject was in all analysed  years of time series, with  exception of the latest year, over -financed. This indicates that they have mor e long -term  resources as fixed asset that is owned by the business subject.   Given the fact that the business subject disposes of approximately the same fixed asset  value, the size of difference is conditional mostly on equity development and by accruals. T he  highest negative value was reached by the business subject in 2010 due to a high level item of  deferred long -term earnings. From this year the value of the golden statistic rose slightly. In the  latest year the indicator’s value reached a negative value due to the merge r of the monitored  business subject with a minor business subject, resulting in high growth of fixed asset s mostly  in the form of buildings and non -fixed assets.        2.4.2 Net working capital   In table 5 (see below Tab. 5 below) the indicator values of net working capital  by the  monitored business subject for each year are listed.      -20 000 000-15 000 000-10 000 000-5 000 00005 000 00010 000 00015 000 00020 000 00025 000 000 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014Fixed assets Long- term obligations Golden statistic rule87   Tab. 5  Indicator s of net working capital     2009  2010  2011  2012  2013  2014   CA 19 403 638 28 020 007  17 872 437  37 793 178  25 639 724  18 248 631   SO 11 580 734  14 044 305  6 279 600  27 077 378  21 365 752  20 445 240   CA- SO=NWC  7 822 904  13 975 702  11 592 837  10 715 800  4 273 972  -2 196 609   Source: own research   In graph 5 the indicator development of net working capital by the monitored business subject  is graphically displayed.     Graph 5  Indicator s of net working capital     Source: own research   From the viewpoint of a comparison with net working capital we can state that NWC has  a natural reverse correlation  with the golden statistic rule. In the business subject until 2012 ,  current asset s exceeded short -term obligations. This fact from the business subject’s point of  view is judged as positive, because in the case of necessity , the business subject is able to  reimburse their obligations by current asset s, which testifies of their good financial situation.  According to graph 5 we can conclude that this value from 2010 decreases due to the decline  of incomplete production and blank stock. In 2012, 2013 and 2014 the decline is also caused  by the increase of business relation ship obligations. In the last reporting  year,  2014 , the net  working capital reached  negative values. Based on this , arises slight ly unfunded debt, wh ich is  for the business subject a warning signal, because in the need for repay ment  of short -term  obligations, they would be forced to sell part of their fixed asset s and thereby would be forced  to influence the business subject’s operations.     2.5 Indebtedness indicators of monitored business subject   By means of these indicators, we look at the financial structure and indebtedness of the  business subject and its indeb tedness repayment ability. The results are shown in table 6 below.

Graph 6 Indicators of indebtedness     Source: (Pastýr, 2014 , 74)  Total assets indebtedness during our 6 year reporting period showed  a fluctuating character.  Their values are in the range from 50.08 up to 67.01. For the optimal total indebtedness is  considered the value 50  %. The company was the closest to this point in 2011 with the value  50.08. They were the most in debt in 2012 with the value 67.01 mainly due to the increase of  time differentiation or profits from future long -term periods.   The coefficient of self -financing is directly related to total assets  indebtedness, which  assesses the field from the point of view of the company’s owners and its sum is  made of                     100 %. Thus its development is the opposite and equally volatile to total asset  indebtedness.  The business subject was the most financially independent in 2011 with 49.92 .   Immediately in the first reporting year the indicator o f insolvency ha d the highest value of 2.04,  from which we can judge that the business subject had issues surrounding  its own activity,  whereas its liabilities to receivables were  higher by more than twice and it s the initial insolvency  mainly due to short -term trade receivables. The business subject entered secondary insolvency  in 2011, when the indicator’s value was 0.91 due to a slight increase of short -term receivables  and decrease of short -term liabilities from trade.   In 2012 the credit indebtedness was a  decreasing trend. The highest financing of foreign  sources through bank loans was reported  in the first reporting year of 2009 with 19.14  %. In  2012 they reached the lowest value of only 0.80  % due to an increase of time differentiation  item profits from future long -term periods.   The interest coverage after 2013 showed an increasing trend . Its value increases  exponentially, which can also be seen on the graph. In 2009 this indicator reached the value  only of 3.94, wh ich was caused by low pre-tax trading income and higher interest expense. In  2013 this indicator increased to 105.71 and in 2013 to a value of 244.30, which was mainly due  to high trade income before tax and low interest expense. This implies that the company covers  their interests with its  profit without any issues.   The indebtedness flow has a fluctuating trend . In 2009 and 2010 this indicator increases to  the value of 11.50. Afterwards  the indicator’s decline until 2013, when the business subject  0,0050,00100,00150,00200,00250,00 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014Total debt assets Coefficient of self- financing Credit indebtedness Interest coverage Flow debt89   would pay its liabilities (debts) at the fo rmation of cash flow of 3.31 per year. Already in the  last reporting year only a slight decrease occurred .    3. PROPOSAL FOR IMPROVE MENTS OF MONITORED B USINESS SUBJECT´S  SELECTED RATIO INDICATORS OF  FINANCIAL -ECONOMIC ANALYSIS     After the processing of financial -economic analysis several weaknesses of the business  subject have been revealed. In the synthesis of this information and following induction we can  generali se some measures for long - term successful operation of the business subjec t. It is the  incorporation of the following measures.     3.1 The activity ratio indicator of the monitored business subject   At the time of stock turnover we propose continuous stock monitoring to prevent the  adverse ly high inventory. As well in the future we propose some optimi sation of stock flow  management in relation to production or its improved procurement from various suppliers,  storage and use through a precise time system, motion planning in parallel with produ ction  needs.   The time of short -term receivables collection can enable further possible business  development within fair trade and good customer -supplier relationships . I see the possibility of  improvement or the volume and frequency of short - term receivab les reduction as well as the  time period of their reimbursement in the incentives of customers themselves through the  provision of cash discount, price discounts for payment before the due date of the relevant  receivable and thereby ensuring stabili sation or receivables turnover time reduction.   A further possibility to decrease the short -term receivables collection is to introduce a strict  internal control system in issuing e.g. customer invoices in the form of rescheduling.   To ensure the timely payment of  receivables of less responsible customers it is necessary  to apply the reminders notice mechanism or sanctioning for non -compliance of contractual  conditions of payment.   In the case of receivables management improvement the acquired financial sources cou ld  be used to reduce the size as well as the short -term liabilities time period of the business subject  from trade by invoice reimbursement from their suppliers to maturity or sooner, or reducing the  need to use short - term bank loans.   The long - term asset  turnover has significant different values, thus I recommend that the  business subject uses their long -term asset s more effectively.   By decreasing the stock turnover time period ensures the greater production flexibility,  because the high volume of stocks  binds unnecessary finances that could be invested into other  business areas e.g. into its development, moderni sation and etc.   By reducing the short - term receivables time period through using a cash discount or price  discounts for payment before maturity of the receivable will lead to a  decline of unliquidated  short -term receivables in the business subject. This allows further use of cashed financial  sources e.g. the earlier payment of short -term liabilities of the business subject or reducing the  need to use short -term bank loans. In the supplier this motivational tool can induce the  willingness on his part to closer cooperat e under favourable  conditions. The introduction of an  internal control system in issuing of customer invoices timeliness and excellen ce may ensured  this. 90   The decline of the short -term liabilities time period or proper and timely payment of  liability to a supplier can creat e between him and the business subject a favourable  and  competitive supplier -customer relationship that can be in the future reflected e.g. in material  supply for more favourable  quantitative and price conditions.     3.2 The profitability ratio indicator of the monitored business subject   We can state that th e results of profitability indicators have positive values. That means the  business subject achieves continuous profit. Almost all these indicators in a period of six years  achieved within the recent two years a slight downward trend. The interests of the business  subject is to stabili se or to increase these values. Therefore a continuous monitoring of  indicators of sales and profit  is required , to increase the level of these indicators. These  objectives can be achieved by the following measures:    by a flexible pricing policy,    by improving the efficiency of the marketing mix,    by efforts to win new customers and cheaper suppliers,    by investing in financial market products for example in bonds and funds.   On the other hand, to prevent further decline of the business subject’s profit, it is required  to secure the economy and efficiency by optimi sation of costs and by individual asset items  utilisation. It is mainly the following cost items:    the cost of material and energy consumption,   - by applying new prod uction technologies and the use of new or innovated  technology,    - by improving work organi sation and production management in the form of  production process harmoni sation, production capacity utili sation,   - by raising the educational level of employees,    the reduction of personnel costs,   - by standardi sed work of production employees,   - by optimi sation of overhead employees,   - by optimi sation of technical and administrative employees.     Following the introduction of design measures there is a premise of the business subject s  economic result increase for the accounting period as well as the increase of the revenue  indicator s. The business subject will accomplish a stabili sed position on the market by obtaining  new and more advantageous financial relationships.  As well higher profitability and more  efficient capital utili sation for business subject’s owners will be accomplished by reali sation of  the mentioned measures.   By optimi sation of costs the business subject will secure their decrease and at the same  time will create conditions for the implementation of innovative and new technologies and  techni ques that should be introduced  to employees on the appropriate educational level.     3.3 The ratio and differential liquidity indicator of the monitored business subje ct  In 2012 , the value of the golden statistic rule indicator for the monitored business subject  registered growth due to the merge r of two business subjects and the growth of current asset s.  The value of this indicator thus reached a  positive value that means the business subject is  under -financed. As a result of this adverse situation, three  ways of this value reduction are  proposed:  91    by increase  of their fixed resources of settlement by raising their equity through basic  capital incr ease in the form of share issue,    by bond issue,    by increase of their external sources through obtaining of long -term bank loan.   Within the monitored business subject the current asset s exceeds short -term obligations.  The exception of this is the latest yea r, therefore we propose towards the future period to  increase the business subject ’s liquidity by increasing the volume of their current financial  asset s:   by reducing the time of debt collection from business relations (by discount, by  monitoring, by mecha nism of reminders, by penalties),    by reduction of supplement turnover time (better supplement management),    by advance charge on customi sed production,    by sale of surplus asset s, but this asset change could result in a lower ability for further  business activities development in the future.     After the implementation of submitted proposals for increas ing the business subject’s  liquidity, there is the premise of a business subject’s solvency increase while the conditions for  balanced development are created. The business subject will have the necessary financial  resources and will be able to reimburse on time their short -term obligations with their financial  resources as well as be able to use them for further development.     3.4 The indebtedness ratio indicator of the monitored business subject   Undertaking in relation to business activity , the business subject has acceptable values of  total indebtedness as well as the self -financing coefficient, thus I do recommend to monitor,  maintain and not to exceed  this state or this indebtedness rate.   Regarding the insolvency indicator the business subject is primarily located in insolvency,  therefore I recommend that the business subject shall try to reduce the level of a short -term  liabilities.   After the incorpo ration of measures the level of equity and foreign capital will stabili se and  the overall stability will be ensured. The business subject will seem more attractive in the  provision of loans as well as in individual investments.     CONCLUSION     In the present turbulent competitive environment the financial analysis is an essential part  of monitoring the business subject and is an important tool to support the decision making of  various stakeholder groups. Also it provides a picture or feedback about the whole c ondition of  business subject and their development and about a condition of individual operation areas.  This analysis is able to identify factors that with the largest stake have caused undesirable  results within the business subject. Through prediction mo dels of financial -economic analysis  the business subject is able to predict their future development and possible option for  bankruptcy.   Among the benefits of this article belongs financial -economic analysis focused on the  business subject’s ratio indicato rs of activity, profitability, liquidity and indebtedness itself.   Related proposals mentioned in this article for weaknesses elimination which  were found by  financial analysis are focused on practical use in the business subject’s experience.     92   Note   The contribution was written within the framework of a research project VEGA 1/0218/16 on  ""The Model of the implementation of controlling as a management tool within medium  enterprises in the engineering and electronics industries"".

6,"Provided by   Accounting Financial Statements   The Academic Center for Excellence  1 May 2022   Accounting Financial Statements     In accounting , it is important to be able to compose and interpret financial statements. Being  able to do this will allow investors, accountants, and lenders to determine the financial health of a company. This handout will explain how to prepare each financial statement, including the  income statement, statement of retained earnings, balance sheet, and statement of cash flows.     Important Terms   You can click each term to navigate to specific sections of this handout.   Income statement : This is the first financial statement prepared . The income statement is  prepared to look at a company’s revenues and expenses over a certain period, such as a month,  a quarter, or a year. When expenses are subtracted from revenues, the result is net income .     Statement of retained earnings : This is the second financial statement prepared. This statement  shows how much of a company’s earnings were kept within the company and not paid out via  dividends (the earnings distributed to a company’s shareholders).    Balance sheet : This is the third financial statement prepared. The balance sheet shows a  company’s financial position at any point in time, rather than over a period. To prepare a company’s balance sheet, all that is needed is the company’s assets, liabilities, and equity.    Statement of cash flows : This is the last financial statement prepared. The statement of cash  flows lists the cash inflows and outflows for a company over a period, such as a month, a quarter, or a year.    Income Statement   When doing income statements, it is important to account for all types of revenues and expenses. For example, common types of revenue accounts include sales, com missions, fees  earned, interest revenue, and service revenue. Common types of expense accounts include depreciation expense, salary expense, rent expense, utilities expense, income tax expense, and  interest expense. The reason the income statement is prepared first is because the final  product is net income, which is needed for the statement of retained earnings.        Provided by   Accounting Financial Statements   The Academic Center for Excellence  2 May  2022   Example:   ABC Company  had a total revenue of $55,000 during the fiscal year, ending on December 31st.  Of the company’s total revenue, $50,000 was from service revenue, $4,000 was from sales, and  $1,000 was from fees earned. Also, ABC Company  had $28,000 in total expenses. Of the  expenses, $10,000 came from paying employee salaries, $8,000 came from rent expenses, and  $5,000 came from interest expenses. Furthermore, ABC Company  had $3,000 of income tax  expenses, $1,000 in depreciation expenses, $1,000 of utility expenses. A clas s assignment may  require students to complete an income statement that would look like the following table .    Income Statement  ABC Company    For Fiscal Year Ended  December 31   Revenues       Service revenue  $50,000     Sales      4,000     Fees earned      1,000     Total revenues   $55,000        Expenses       Salary expense  $10,000     Rent expense      8,000     Interest expense      5,000     Income tax expense      3,000     Depreciation expense      1,000     Utilities expense      1,000     Total expenses   $28,000        Net income    $27,000     It should be noted that the net income of $27,000 was calculated by subtracting the total  expenses of $28,000 from the total revenues of $55,000. ABC Company ’s net income will be  used to prepare the next financial statement, which is the statement of retai ned earnings.          Provided by   Accounting Financial Statements   The Academic Center for Excellence  3 May  2022   Statement of Retained Earnings   The reason this is the second statement to prepare is because the retained earnings are needed  to prepare the equity section of the balance sheet. T he first item needed to determine a  company’s  retained earnings for a period is to record the retained earni ngs from the beginning  of the period. Next, add the company’s net income from the income statement to the amount of retained earnings at the beginning of the period. Finally, subtract how much money was paid in dividends to the company’s shareholders.   Example:   The following table shows ABC Company ’s retained earnings as of the end of the fiscal year on  December 31st. It should be noted that ABC Company  started the year with $12,000 in retained  earnings. They also had a net income of $27,000 for year, which  was calculated by preparing  the income statement. Lastly, they paid out $4,000 in dividends to company shareholders  during the fiscal year. A class assignment may require students to complete a statement of retained earnings for ABC Company that would loo k like the following table.     Statement of  Retained Earnings  ABC Company   For Fiscal Year Ended  December 31st    Retained earnings  (January 1st)  $12,000   Add Net income    27,000     $39,000   Subtract  Dividends    4,000    Retained earnings   (December 31st)  $35,000     In this example, ABC Company  started the fiscal year with $12,000. After adding $27,000 to that  amount, the running total is $39,000. Next, $4,000 is subtracted from that to account for  dividend payments. Therefore, ABC Company  ends the year with $35,000 in retained earnings.  The $35,000 in retained earnings will be needed to prepare the equity section of the next  financial statement, the balance sheet.            Provided by   Accounting Financial Statements   The Academic Center for Excellence  4 May  2022   Balance Sheet   The balance sheet is prepared using the accounting equation formula. Therefore, it should be  set up as assets = liabilities + equity. The company’s asset accounts should be recorded on the  left side of the page, while its liabilities and equity accounts should be recorded on the right  side of the page. Assets are any tangible item of value that a company owns. Common examples of assets are cash, accounts receivable, land, equipment, and inventory. Liabilities are debts the company owes to other entities, such as lenders, sellers, and other companies.  Common examples of liabilities are accounts payable, wages payable, notes payable, and taxes  payable. The difference between a company’s assets and liabilities is the company’s equity. Within the equity section of the balance sheet, the company’s retained earnings and common stock are listed. The reason the balance sheet is the third statement prepared is because the  cash account balance in assets is needed for the statement of cash flows. The following table  shows ABC Company’s balance sheet on December 31st.   Example:   On December 31 st, ABC Company  had $75,000 in total assets. Of their assets, they had $50,000  in cash, $20,000 in inventory, and $5,000 in accounts receivable. ABC Company  also had  $27,000 in total l iabilities. Of their liabilities, they had $15,000 in wages payable, $6,000 in  accounts payable, $3,000 in taxes payable, and $3,000 in notes payable. In addition, ABC  Company  had $48,000 in equity. Of their equity, they had $13,000 in common stock and  $35,000 in retained earnings. A class assignment may require students to complete a balance sheet for ABC Company that would look like the following table.     Balance Sheet  ABC Company    December 31st   Assets   Liabilities    Cash  $50,000  Wages payable  $15,000   Inventory    20,000  Accounts payable      6,000   Accounts receivable      5,000  Taxes payable      3,000     Notes payable      3,000     Total liabilities   $27,000          Equity      Common stock  $13,000     Retained earnings    35,000     Total equity  $48,000        Total assets  $75,000  Total liabilities and equity  $75,000    Provided by   Accounting Financial Statements   The Academic Center for Excellence  5 May  2022   In the example above, it should be noted that the value of the total assets equals the value of  the total liabilities and equity combined, which is $75,000 for each. Also, remember that the  retained earnings from the previous statement were used to prepare the equity section of the  balance sheet. To prepare the next statement, which is the statement of cash flows, the cash  account balance in the assets section will be needed. Therefore, the $50,000 in cash will be used to prepare the statement of cash flows.    Statement of Cash Flows   The statement of cash flows is divided into three sections. The first section is the cash flows  from operating activities. Examples of operating activity accounts include wages, salaries,  interest payments, interest income, cash receipts from customers, and c ash paid to vendors.  The second section is the cash flows from investing activities. For example, investing cash flows could be the buying and selling of an asset, such as equipment. The third section is the cash flows from financing activities. Examples o f financing cash flows would be dividends paid to  shareholders, cash investments by investors, bond issuances, and repayment of loans. The sum  of net cash flows from all three activities should equal the cash balance in the cash account  from the balance sheet. Additionally, there are two different methods to prepare the statement of cash flows: the direct method and the indirect method.     The following example shows ABC Company ’s statement of cash flows for the fiscal year that  ended on December 31st. ABC Company  uses the direct method in the following example. It  should be noted that account balances in parentheses indicate a negative balance for that  account.     Example:   At the  beginning of the fiscal year, ABC Company  had $0 in cash. During the year, they  increased that amount by $50,000, to end with $50,000. ABC Company  accumulated a net total  of $52,000 from operating activities.  Even though they received $70,000 cash from c ustomer  receipts, they paid $10,000 to vendors and $8,000 for rent. ABC Company  had a negative  balance of $18,000 for investing activities during the year. Of that $18,000, $12,000 went  toward purchasing vehicles, $4,000 went toward purchasing computer equipment, and $2,000 went toward purchasing furniture. For financing activities, ABC Company  accumulated a net  total of $16,000. Even though they received $26,000 in investments from investors, they still paid $6,000 towards their bank loan, and $4,000 via d ividends toward their shareholders. A  class assignment may require students to complete a statement of cash flows for ABC Company that would look like the table  on the following page .      Provided by   Accounting Financial Statements   The Academic Center for Excellence  6 May  2022   ABC Company    Statement of Cash  Flows  Fiscal Year Ended on  December 31st    Cash flows from  operating Activities       Cash receipts from  customers  $70,000     Cash paid to vendors  (10,000)     Cash paid for rent  (8,000)     Net cash from  operating activities   $52,000   Cash flows from  investing activities       Cash paid for  vehicles  $(12,000)     Cash paid for  computer equipment     (4,000)     Cash paid for  furniture     (2,000)     Net cash from  investing activities   $(18,000)   Cash flows from  financing activities       Cash investments  from investors  $26,000     Cash paid towards  bank loan    (6,000)     Cash paid in the form  of dividends to  shareholders    (4,000)     Net cash from  financing activities   $16,000   Net increase in cash    $50,000   Cash balance,  January 1 st   $0  Cash balance,  December 31 st   $50,000      Provided by   Accounting Financial Statements   The Academic Center for Excellence  7 May 2022   It should be noted that the ending cash balance equals the cash balance on the balance sheet,  which is $50,000. The $50,000 was calculated by adding the net cash from operating, investing, and financing activities. It should also be noted that ABC Company  started the fiscal year with  $0 in cash and increased that amount to $50,000 cash by the end of the year.

10,"FINANCIAL ANALYSIS   Financia l Statements     The income statement provides information about  revenue and expenses of a firm,    The balance sheet provides a point in time snap shot of the firm’s assets, liabilities and  owner’s equity.     Benchmarking:  The financial statements by themselves are complex documents involving a  whole bunch of numbers.     One common method of benchmarking is to compare a firm’s current performance against  that of its own performance over a 3 -5 year period (trend analysis) , by l ooking at the growth  rate in various key items such as sales, costs, and profi ts.   Another useful way is to re state the income statement and the balance sheet into common  size statements, by expressing each income statement item as a percent of sales and ea ch  balance sheet item as a percent of total assets     Financial Ratios     Financial ratios allow for meaningful comparisons across time, between competitors, and  with industry averages.    Liquidity ratios : Can the company meet its obligations over the short term?    Solvency ratios : (also known as financial leverage ratios ): Can the company meet its  obligations over the long term?    Asset management ratios : How efficiently is the company managing its assets to g enerate  sales?    Profitability ratios : How well has the company performed overall?    Market value ratios : How does the market (investors) view the company’s financial  prospects?       Du Pont analysis : which involves a breakdown of the return on equity into its th ree  components, i.e. profit margin, turnover, and leverage.     Liquidity Ratios:  measure  a company’s ability to cover its short -term debt obligations in a  timely manner:    Three key liquidity ratios include the current ratio, quick ratio, and cash ratio.     Financial Leverage Ratios:  measure a company’s ability to meet its long -term debt obligations  based on its overall debt level and earnings capacity.    Failure to meet its interest obligation could put a firm into bankruptcy.    Key financial leverage ratios are  the debt ratio, times interest earned ratio, and cash coverage  ratio.     Asset Management Ratios:  measure how efficiently a firm is using its assets to generate  revenues or how much cash is being tied up in other assets such as receivables and inventory.    Key asset management ratios are inventory turnover, accounts receivables turnover, average  collection period, and total asset turnover.    Profitability Ratios:  such as net profit margin, returns on assets, and return on equity, measure a  firm’s effectivenes s in turning sales or assets into profits    Potential investors and analysts often use these ratios as part of their valuation analysis.     Market Value Ratios:  are used to gauge how attractive a firm’s current price is relative to its  earnings, growth rate, a nd book value    Typically, if a firm has a high price to earnings and a high market to book value ratio, it is an  indication that investors have a good perception about the firm’s performance.    If these ratios are very high it could also mean that a firm is over-valued.     DuPont analysis:  involves breaking down ROE into three components of the firm:    operating efficiency , as measured by the profit margin (net income/sales);    asset management efficiency , as measured by asset turnover (sales/total assets); and    financial leverage , as measured by the equity multiplier (total assets/total equity).         Questions   1. What is the accounting identity?   Assets ≡ Liabilities + Owner’s Equity     2. What does analyzing companies over time tell a finance manager?   Trend analysis tells a financial manager the rate at which the various key items are growing  and helps explain why profits are growing or eroding over time.     3. What does restating financial statements into common -size financial statements allow a  finance manager or financial analy st to do?   Common -size financial statements allow a comparison of companies that are very different in  size. It then allows comparison of management choices, such as debt financing or analysis of  production costs.     4. What are liquidity ratios? Given an exampl e of a liquidity ratio and how it helps  evaluate a company’s performance or future performance from an outsider’s view.   Liquidity ratios are ratios that show the short -term cash obligation capabilities of the  company. The current ratio is a liquidity ratio  and it is current assets divided by current  liabilities. When this ratio is greater than one it indicates a company should have sufficient  cash from its current assets to pay off its current liabilities. This helps an outsider evaluate  potential cash flow  problems of the company.     5. What are solvency ratios? Which ratio would be of most interest to a banker  considering a debt loan to a company? Why?   Solvency ratios are ratios that demonstrate the ability of the company to meet debt  obligations over an extend ed period of time. A banker would probably be most interested in  Times Interest Earned to see if the company has sufficient cash from operations to handle  more interest payments on a new loan.  6. What are asset management ratios?   Asset management ratios are r atios that indicate how well the management team is using the  assets of the company to generate prof its.     7. What does the P/E ratio tell an outsider about a com pany?   The P/E ratio tells you if the firm is a growth firm or a stable firm with growth firms ha ving  higher P/E ratios. T     8. What are the three components of the DuPont identity? What do they analyze?   The three components of the DuPont analysis are, (1) operating efficiency, (2) asset  management efficiency, and (3) financial leverage. They analyze the return on equity or the  shareholders’ return.     9. What does analyzing a company against firms in other industries tell a financial  manager or analyst?   Analyzing a company against firms in other industries may indicate what areas the company  and its industry are falling behind in general.         ______________________________________________________________________________     KEY FINANCIAL RATIO S - DETAILS   ______________________________________________________________________________   Current Ratio    Current ratio measures the ability of a business to repay current liabilities with current assets.    Current assets are assets that are expected to be converted to cas h within normal operating  cycle, or one year. Examples of current assets include cash and cash equivalents, marketable  securities, short -term investments, accounts receivable, short -term portion of notes  receivable, inventories and short -term prepayments.    Current liabilities are obligations that require settlement within normal operating cycle or  next 12 months. Examples of current liabilities include accounts payable, salaries and wages  payable, current tax payable, sales tax payable, accrued expenses, etc .  Formula   Current Ratio = Current Assets/Current Liabilities     Analysis    Current ratio matches current assets with current liabilities and tells us whether the current  assets are enough to settle current liabilities.    A current ratio of 1 or more means that  current assets are more than current liabilities and the  company should not face any liquidity problem.    A current ratio below 1 means that current liabilities are more than current assets, which may  indicate liquidity problems.    In general, higher current ratio is better.    Current ratios should be analyzed in the context of relevant industry. Some industries for  example retail, have very high current ratios. Others, for example service providers such as  accounting firms, have relatively low current r atios because they do not have any significant  current assets.    An abnormally high value of current ratio may indicate existence of idle or underutilized  resources in the company.     Quick Ratio    Quick ratio is a stricter measure of liquidity of a company than its current ratio.     Quick ratio is most useful where the proportion of illiquid current assets to total current  assets is high.     Formula   Quick Ratio = (Cash + Marketable Securities + Receivables )/Current Liabilities     Another approach to calculation of quick ratio involves subtracting all illiquid current assets  from total current assets and dividing the resulting figure by total current liabilities.      Quick Ratio = (Current Assets − Inventories – Prepayments )/Current Liabilities    Analysis    Quick rati o is particularly useful in assessing liquidity situation of companies in a crunch  situation, i.e. when they find it difficult to sell inventories.    Quick ratio should be analyzed in the context of other liquidity ratios such as current ratio,  cash ratio, e tc., the relevant industry of the company, its competitors and the ratio’s trend  over time.    A quick ratio lower than the industry average might indicate that the company may face  difficulty honoring its current obligations. Alternatively, a quick ratio si gnificantly higher  than the industry average highlights inefficiency as it indicates that the company has parked  too much cash in low -return assets.     Debt Ratio    Debt ratio (also known as debt to assets ratio) measures debt level of a business as a  percentage of its total assets.    It is calculated by dividing total debt of a business by its total assets.    Debt ratio finds out the percentage of total assets that are financed by debt .   A too high percentage  indicate that it is too difficult for the business to pay off its debts and  continue operations.     Formula   Debt Ratio = Total Debt /Total Assets    Total debt equals long -term debt and short -term debt.    Total assets include both current assets and non -current assets.     Analysis    Debt ratio is a measure of a business’s financial risk, the risk that the business’ total assets  may not be sufficient to pay off its debts and interest thereon.    While a very low debt ratio is good, it may indicate underutilization of a major source of  finance which may result in restricted growth.     Times Interest Earned Ratio    Times interest earned ratio (also called interest coverage ratio) is an indicator of the  company’s ability to pay off i ts interest expense with available earnings.    It is a measure of a company’s solvency, i.e. its long -term financial strength.    It calculates how many times a company’s operating income (earnings before interest and  taxes) can settle the company’s interest e xpense.    A higher times interest earned ratio indicates that the company’s interest expense is low  relative to its earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) which indicates better long -term  financial strength, and vice versa.     Formula   Times Interest Earned  = Earnings before Interest and Tax  (EBIT)/ Interest Expense       Analysis    While debt ratio indicates total debt exposure relative to total assets, times interest earned  (TIE) ratio assesses whether the company is earning enough to pay off the associated interest  expense.    Higher value of times interest earned (TIE) ratio is favorable as it shows that the company  has sufficient earnings to pay off interest expense and hence its debt obligations.    Lower values highlight that the company may not be in a posit ion to meet its debt  obligations.     Net Profit Margin    Net profit margin (also called profit margin) is the most basic profitability ratio that measures  the percentage of net income of an entity to its net sales.    It represents the proportion of sales that is left over after all relevant expenses have been  adjusted.    A high ratio indicates that the company is profitable.     Formula   Net Profit Margin = Net Income /Net Sales     Return on Equity (ROE) Ratio    Return on equity is the ratio of net income to stockholder s' equity.    It is a measure of profitability of stockholders' investments.    It shows net income as percentage of shareholder equity.     Formula   ROE = Net Income /Stockholders' Equity      Net income is the after tax income , whereas    Shareholder  equity is common stock fund plus retained earnings     Analysis    High  ROE value mean s that the firm is effici ent in generating income on stock investment.    Investors should compare the ROE of different companies and check the trend over time.    ROE can be artificially influenced by the management, for example, when debt financing is  used to reduce share capital there will be an increase in ROE even if income remains  constant .    Earnings per Share (EPS)    Earnings per share (EPS) is a profitability indicator which shows dol lars of net income  earned by a company per share of its common stock    EPS is a very important profitability ratio, particularly for shareholders of a company,  because it is a direct measure of dollars earned per share.     Analysis    EPS standardizes earnings  with reference to number of shares outstanding.    However, EPS alone too is not very useful because different companies have different  number of shares.     Price/Earnings (P/E) Ratio    Price/Earnings or P/E ratio is the ratio of a company's share price to its earnings per share.    It tells whether the share price of a company is fairly valued, undervalued or overvalued.    A high P/E ratio indicates high growth prospects for the company.     Formula   P/E Ratio = Current Share Price /Earnings per Share       Dividend Payout Ratio    Dividend payout ratio is the percentage of a company’s earnings that it pays out to investors  in the form of dividends.    It is calculated by dividing dividends paid during a period by net earnings for that period.     Formula   Dividend Payout Ratio = Dividend per Share /Earnings per Share     Analysis    People invest in a company expecting a return on their investment which comes from two  sources: capital gains and dividends.    A high  dividend payout ratio means that the company is reinvesting less earnings in future  projects, which in turn means less capital gains in future periods.    Similarly, low payout ratio today may result in higher capital gains in future.    Some investors prefer companies that provide high potential for capital gains while others  prefer companies that pay high dividends.    Dividend payout ratio helps each class of investors identify which companies to invest in .    Inventory Turnover Ratio    Inventory turnover is an asset efficiency ratio which calculates the number of times per  period a business sells and replaces its entire batch of inventories.     Formula   Inventory Turnover = Cost of Goods Sold /Average Inventories     Analysis    Inventory turnover ratio assess es how efficiently a business is managing its inventories.    In general, a high inventory turnover indicates efficient operations.    A low inventory turnover compared to the industry average and competitors means poor  inventories manageme nt.   However, a very high value of this ratio may result in stock -out costs, i.e., when a business is  not able to meet sales demand due to non -availability of inventories.    Inventory turnover is a very industry -specific ratio. Businesses which trade perisha ble goods  have very higher turnover compared to those dealing in durables. Hence a comparison would  only be fair if made between businesses in the same industry.       Days' Sales Outstanding (DSO) Ratio    Days' sales outstanding ratio (also called average coll ection period  or days' sales in  receivables ) is used to measure the average number of days a business takes to collect its  trade receivables after they have been created.    It gives information about the efficiency of sales collection activities.     Formula   Days Sales Outstanding is calculated using following formula:     DSO =   Accounts Receivable   × Number of Days  Credit Sales     Analysis    A low value of Days Sales Outstanding is favorable indicating that the firm is collecting  money faster.     Total  Assets Turnover Ratio    Fixed assets turnover ratio measures how successfully a company is utilizing its  assets in  generating revenue.    It calculates the dollars of revenue earned per on e dollar of investment in assets.    A higher asset turnover ratio is gene rally better.   Formula   Assets Turnover Ratio = Sales/ Fixed Asset",6

Quick Ratio = (Current Assets − Inventories – Prepayments )/Current Liabilities    Analysis    Quick rati o is particularly useful in assessing liquidity situation of companies in a crunch  situation, i.e. when they find it difficult to sell inventories.    Quick ratio should be analyzed in the context of other liquidity ratios such as current ratio,  cash ratio, e tc., the relevant industry of the company, its competitors and the ratio’s trend  over time.    A quick ratio lower than the industry average might indicate that the company may face  difficulty honoring its current obligations. Alternatively, a quick ratio si gnificantly higher  than the industry average highlights inefficiency as it indicates that the company has parked  too much cash in low -return assets.     Debt Ratio    Debt ratio (also known as debt to assets ratio) measures debt level of a business as a  percentage of its total assets.    It is calculated by dividing total debt of a business by its total assets.    Debt ratio finds out the percentage of total assets that are financed by debt .   A too high percentage  indicate that it is too difficult for the business to pay off its debts and  continue operations.     Formula   Debt Ratio = Total Debt /Total Assets    Total debt equals long -term debt and short -term debt.    Total assets include both current assets and non -current assets.     Analysis    Debt ratio is a measure of a business’s financial risk, the risk that the business’ total assets  may not be sufficient to pay off its debts and interest thereon.    While a very low debt ratio is good, it may indicate underutilization of a major source of  finance which may result in restricted growth.     Times Interest Earned Ratio    Times interest earned ratio (also called interest coverage ratio) is an indicator of the  company’s ability to pay off i ts interest expense with available earnings.    It is a measure of a company’s solvency, i.e. its long -term financial strength.    It calculates how many times a company’s operating income (earnings before interest and  taxes) can settle the company’s interest e xpense.    A higher times interest earned ratio indicates that the company’s interest expense is low  relative to its earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) which indicates better long -term  financial strength, and vice versa.     Formula   Times Interest Earned  = Earnings before Interest and Tax  (EBIT)/ Interest Expense       Analysis    While debt ratio indicates total debt exposure relative to total assets, times interest earned  (TIE) ratio assesses whether the company is earning enough to pay off the associated interest  expense.    Higher value of times interest earned (TIE) ratio is favorable as it shows that the company  has sufficient earnings to pay off interest expense and hence its debt obligations.    Lower values highlight that the company may not be in a posit ion to meet its debt  obligations.     Net Profit Margin    Net profit margin (also called profit margin) is the most basic profitability ratio that measures  the percentage of net income of an entity to its net sales.    It represents the proportion of sales that is left over after all relevant expenses have been  adjusted.    A high ratio indicates that the company is profitable.     Formula   Net Profit Margin = Net Income /Net Sales     Return on Equity (ROE) Ratio    Return on equity is the ratio of net income to stockholder s' equity.    It is a measure of profitability of stockholders' investments.    It shows net income as percentage of shareholder equity.     Formula   ROE = Net Income /Stockholders' Equity      Net income is the after tax income , whereas    Shareholder  equity is common stock fund plus retained earnings     Analysis    High  ROE value mean s that the firm is effici ent in generating income on stock investment.    Investors should compare the ROE of different companies and check the trend over time.    ROE can be artificially influenced by the management, for example, when debt financing is  used to reduce share capital there will be an increase in ROE even if income remains  constant .    Earnings per Share (EPS)    Earnings per share (EPS) is a profitability indicator which shows dol lars of net income  earned by a company per share of its common stock    EPS is a very important profitability ratio, particularly for shareholders of a company,  because it is a direct measure of dollars earned per share.     Analysis    EPS standardizes earnings  with reference to number of shares outstanding.    However, EPS alone too is not very useful because different companies have different  number of shares.     Price/Earnings (P/E) Ratio    Price/Earnings or P/E ratio is the ratio of a company's share price to its earnings per share.    It tells whether the share price of a company is fairly valued, undervalued or overvalued.    A high P/E ratio indicates high growth prospects for the company.     Formula   P/E Ratio = Current Share Price /Earnings per Share       Dividend Payout Ratio    Dividend payout ratio is the percentage of a company’s earnings that it pays out to investors  in the form of dividends.    It is calculated by dividing dividends paid during a period by net earnings for that period.     Formula   Dividend Payout Ratio = Dividend per Share /Earnings per Share     Analysis    People invest in a company expecting a return on their investment which comes from two  sources: capital gains and dividends.    A high  dividend payout ratio means that the company is reinvesting less earnings in future  projects, which in turn means less capital gains in future periods.    Similarly, low payout ratio today may result in higher capital gains in future.    Some investors prefer companies that provide high potential for capital gains while others  prefer companies that pay high dividends.    Dividend payout ratio helps each class of investors identify which companies to invest in .    Inventory Turnover Ratio    Inventory turnover is an asset efficiency ratio which calculates the number of times per  period a business sells and replaces its entire batch of inventories.     Formula   Inventory Turnover = Cost of Goods Sold /Average Inventories     Analysis    Inventory turnover ratio assess es how efficiently a business is managing its inventories.    In general, a high inventory turnover indicates efficient operations.    A low inventory turnover compared to the industry average and competitors means poor  inventories manageme nt.   However, a very high value of this ratio may result in stock -out costs, i.e., when a business is  not able to meet sales demand due to non -availability of inventories.    Inventory turnover is a very industry -specific ratio. Businesses which trade perisha ble goods  have very higher turnover compared to those dealing in durables. Hence a comparison would  only be fair if made between businesses in the same industry.       Days' Sales Outstanding (DSO) Ratio    Days' sales outstanding ratio (also called average coll ection period  or days' sales in  receivables ) is used to measure the average number of days a business takes to collect its  trade receivables after they have been created.    It gives information about the efficiency of sales collection activities.     Formula   Days Sales Outstanding is calculated using following formula:     DSO =   Accounts Receivable   × Number of Days  Credit Sales     Analysis    A low value of Days Sales Outstanding is favorable indicating that the firm is collecting  money faster.     Total  Assets Turnover Ratio    Fixed assets turnover ratio measures how successfully a company is utilizing its  assets in  generating revenue.    It calculates the dollars of revenue earned per on e dollar of investment in assets.    A higher asset turnover ratio is gene rally better.   Formula   Assets Turnover Ratio = Sales/ Fixed Asset",6
12,"Financial Statement Review:    Financial Statements Tutorial    There are four major financial statements used to communicate information to external users (creditors,  investors, suppliers, etc.)  -  1. Balance Sheet  (assets, liabilities, and Shareholder’s equity)  2. Income Statement (r evenues and expenses)  3. Statement of Changes in Shareholder’s E quity (contributed capital and retained earnings)   Statement of Retained Earnings  4. Statement of Cash Flows    Balance Sheet   Financial statement that presents the financ ial position of the company on a particular date.   Summarized by the accounting equation which must always be in balance  (Assets=Liabilities + Shareholder’s Equity)   Three categories of accounts:  1. Assets    Three Characteristics of Assets  a) It has probable future benefit that involves a ca pacity to contribute directly or indirectly to  future net cash flows  b) A particular entity can obtain the benefit  and control other’s access to the asset  c) The transaction that result ed in the entity’s right to the benefit of the asset has already  occurred   Examples: Cash, Accounts Receivable, Land, E quipment, Construction in Progress, Patents,  Copyrights, G oodwill, etc.    2. Liabilities   Amounts that company owes to its creditors   Examples: Notes Payable, Accounts  Payable, Unearned Revenue, etc.    3. Owner’s Equity (Stockholder’s Equity or Shareholder’s Equity)   The owner’s claims to the assets of the company   Includes both retained earnings and capita l stock (common stock,  preferred stock)   Most companies prepare a classified balance sheet which is the same as a regular balance sheet except assets  and liabilities are categorized as current and non-current.  1. Current—will be used or paid for within the next year   Examples:  1. Current Assets: Cash, A ccounts Receivable, Inventory  2. Current Liabilities: Accounts Payable, Unearned Revenue  2. Non-current asset—will not be used or paid for within the next year   Examples:  1. Non-Current Assets: Land, Notes Receivable, Equipment  2. Non-Current Liabilities: Notes Payable, Bonds Payable    Income Statement   Financial statement that reports the company’s revenues and expenses over an interval of time (usually one  accounting period)   Shows whether the company was able to generate enough revenue to cover the expenses of running the  business    Revenue - Expenses = Net Income or Net Loss   Revenues equal the selling price of a good or service   Expenses are costs incurred to earn revenue   Example: Tom sells Jane a t-shirt for $20.  It cost Tom $15.  Tom’s revenue is $20, his cost of goods sold  (expense) is $15, and his net income is $5.    Multiple Step Income Statement  (only used for merchandising companies)  Sales  -Cost of Goods Sold  Gross Profit  -Operating Expenses   Operating Income  +/- Miscellaneous   Net Income before taxes -Income Tax Expense  Net Income  Statement of Changes in Shareholder’s Equity    Contributed Capital and retained earnings     Retained Earnings :  Beginning Retained Earnings  Less Dividends  Plus Net Income or Minus Net Loss  Ending Retained Earnings    Statement of Cash Flows   Financial statement that measures activities involving cash  receipts and cash  payments over an interval of time  (usually one accounting period).    Cash flows can be classified into one of three categories:  1. Operating Activities  - day-to-day general activities to run the business   Examples:  Purchasing inventory for cash, selli ng inventory for cash, paying cash for a business  license, paying cash fo r utilities, etc. 2. Investing Activities  - purchase and sale of assets that last longer than one year   `Examples:  Purchasing land for cash, selling property for cash, etc.  3. Financing Activities  - cash transactions involvi ng a company’s long-term creditors or owners   Examples: Receiving cash from a bank loan, re ceiving cash from the issue of common stock,  receiving cash from the sale of bonds, paying cash for dividends, paying cash for principal on a  loan    Preparation of Financial Statements:  Example 1:  The following items were taken from the accounting records of Bowser Incorporated.

The statements of 432 cooperatives were used to compare 1995 to 1994, while 1,610 cooperatives were used to look at trends over the past 10 years. Cooperatives were divided into four groups based on their mix of net sales between supplies sold and farm products marketed. They were also divided into four size cate- gories, based on their total sales volume. Average net income increased 14 percent from 1994 to 1995. In 1995, average net sales for all cooperatives studied was $12.2 million, up 8 percent from 1994. More than 36 percent of the cooperatives studied were small cooperatives-sales of less than !§5 million. Cooperatives not only were important to their member/patrons, but also were an impor- tant asset to their rural communities. They were probably one of the community’s larg- er employers, employing an average 21 full-time and 9 part-time employees with an average annual payroll of $707,000. Petroleum products and fertilizer were the two principal farm supplies sold. Marketing activities (mainly grains and oilseeds) provided more than 54 percent of sales for these cooperatives. Average total assets grew 17 percent between 1994 and 1995, fueled by large increas- es in inventories. To finance the growth in assets (mainly inventories), total liabilities grew 31 percent while owner equities increased 5 percent. Interest expenses, although less than 1 percent of net sales, increased 42 percent largely due to increased short-term debt used to finance inventory buildup. Local sav- ings was down 24 percent, but with an increase of 37 percent in patronage refunds received, net income for these cooperatives was up 14 percent. Financial ratio analysis was used to look at 1 O-year trends for the 1,610 cooperatives in the data base. The financial ratio analysis revealed these findings: l The current ratio (current assets/current liabilities) was fairly steady around 1.5 between 1988 and 1994, with a slight downturn in 1995. The quick ratio (current assets-inventory/current liabilities) mimicked the current ratio’s trend. . Total debt-to-asset ratio was 0.25 in 1995, higher than most recent years but lower than the high of 0.3 in 1985. l The fixed-asset-turnover ratio, a measure of asset utilization, has averaged at least 9.1 for the past 3 years ( i.e., net sales were 9.1 times property, plant, and equipment levels). l Return on total assets measures the rate of return on total investments. At 8 percent, this measure was down slightly from 1994. l Return on allocated equity before taxes has grown dramatically in the decade from 5 percent to 14 percent. . . .111Analysis of Financial Statements: Local Farm Supply, Marketing Cooperatives E. Eldon Eversull and Beverly L. Rotan Rural Business-Cooperative Service U.S. Department of Agriculture Local agricultural cooperatives play a vital role in providing goods and services to their patrons and the rural community. This report analyzes their financial statements for comparative purposes for cooperative managers, directors, and members. Ratio analysis and trends will be discussed. The presentation is sub-divided into four cooperative sizes and types to make the information more useful. The 432 local cooperatives had farm supply sales (petroleum, fertilizer, feed, etc.) that averaged $5.6 mil- lion in 1995 while marketing sales (corn, wheat, soy- beans, etc.) averaged $6.6 million. Income from ser- vices (product delivery, fertilizer application, grains and oilseeds  hauling and storage, etc.) averaged SO.4 million per year. These cooperatives were not only important to, their member/patrons, but also an important asset to their rural communities. The cooperatives paid an average of $43,000 in annual property taxes. They were also a large employer in their communities, averaging 21 full-time and 9 part-time employees with an aver- age annual payroll of $707,000. Cooperative annual reports generally contain the balance sheet and a statement of operations. More detailed reports may contain a statement of changes in patrons’ equity and a statement of cash-flows along with explanations detailing various aspects of the financial statements. The manager and the president of the board of directors may also provide a statement on the cooperative’s past year operating results and future plans. This study focuses on the balance sheet, income statement, and financial ratios derived from these statements.Profile of Respondent Cooperatives Staff of the Cooperative Services (CS) program in USDA’s Rural Business-Cooperative Service annually survey farmer cooperatives. Data from this survey are used in this study. To be included, a cooperative had to sell some farm supplies. No cooperative that exclusive- ly markets members’ products was included. In addi- tion to selling farm supplies, the cooperative also had to provide an annual report that had a detailed income statement. There are 1,610 cooperatives in the CS Farm Supply and Services (FSS)  database. This report focus- es on 432 cooperatives that provided information in both 1995 and 1994 when comparing those years and on all 1,610 cooperatives when looking at long-term trends (1985 through 1993 ‘) in the financial ratio analysis section. To obtain a more complete under- standing of the local cooperatives’ business, informa- tion in this report is divided into a cross section of four sizes and four types. Cooperative Size Cooperatives were grouped into four sizes by sales volume, using actual figures. No attempt was made to deflate these values. Sales groupings used in this report were the same as in prior reports (see CS- RR 134 and RR 138) and, for the 432 cooperatives, sizes and types used are summarized in table 1. 1 The data in the FSS database does not include 1991. It was omitted in an effort to disseminate information in a more timely fashion. At the time, it was thought that information from 1991 would be included in the future, but as that information became less and less current, it is less likely to become part of the database. 1In classifying by total sales alone, product mix was ignored. For example, a cooperative with $10 mil- lion in sales that exclusively marketed grains and oilseeds  could be considered small relative to most grains and oilseeds  marketing organizations. But, a strictly farm supply cooperative with sales of $10 mil- lion, however, was quite substantial. Cooperative Type To account for differences in operations and ori- entation based on product mix, cooperatives were grouped into one of four descriptive categories: 1) farm supply; 2) mixed farm supply; 3) mixed market- ing; and 4) marketing. These descriptions were chosen to represent business operations of these cooperatives as closely as possible and their definitions summarized in table 1. This report focuses on cooperatives handling farm supplies-42 percent in 1995 sold only farm sup- plies; 16 percent were mixed; 24 percent were mixed marketing; and 18 percent were marketing (table 2). Of Table r-Size and type definitions used for respondent cooperatives Cooperative size Definition Number Small up to $5 million in total sales 156 Medium $5 million to $10 million 103 Large $10 million to $20 million 96 Super $20 million and more 75 Cooperative type Farm supply total net sales from farm supplies’ 161 Mixed farm supply from 50 to 99 percent 70 Mixed marketing from 25 to 49 percent 103 Marketing less than 25 percent 78 1 The definition of farm supply cooperatives differs from prior reports. These cooperatives now have 100 percent farm supply sales instead of 90 to 100 percent.the respondents, 36 percent were small; 24 percent, medium; 23 percent, large; and 17 percent, super. Both types of marketing cooperatives tended to be larger while the farm supply cooperatives were most often small. Most respondents were small farm supply coop- eratives. The first part of this report focuses on the 432 cooperatives that provided information in both 1995 and 1994. In the financial ratio analysis sections, data between the years were not completely comparable in that the same cooperatives did not respond to the CS survey every year. Information in the FSS database was not randomly selected and may not be statistically valid to draw industry-wide conclusions. However, the samples are large and represent a cross section of cooperatives selling farm supplies and marketing grains and oilseeds  throughout the United States. The information in this report also goes beyond 432 cooperatives and rural communities. These coop- eratives operated 643 branches and had a significant business impact on 1,075 rural communities in terms of taxes and employment (table 3). Super cooperatives that averaged almost five branch outlets impacted more rural communities. Marketing cooperatives had an average of two branch outlets. Sales Mix The respondent cooperatives had five major farm supply and two marketing categories (table 4). Petroleum was the dominant production supply item sold by small and medium cooperatives. Sales of small cooperatives, the most numerous, averaged $2.8 mil- lion in 1995. Farm production supplies represented the bulk (86 percent) of their sales. As cooperatives grew in size, the importance of farm supplies declined (64 percent for medium-sized cooperatives, 52 percent for large, and 32 percent for super). Table z-Respondent cooperatives by size and type Cooperative size Cooperative type Small Medium Large Super Total Number Percenf Farm supply 122 37 19 3 41.90 Mixed farm supply 14 23 22 11 16.20 Mixed marketing 12 28 33 30 23.84 Marketing a 15 24 31 18.06 Percent of total 36.11 23.84 22.69 17.36 100.00Sales of mixed farm supply cooperatives aver- aged $12 million with $5 million in farm supply sales. Petroleum was the most important farm supply item sold, with feed a close second. Average sales of marketing and mixed marketing cooperatives were $22 million and $18 million, respec- tively, and much larger than both categories of farm supply cooperatives. As defined, marketing made up the majority of their sales. Feed, fertilizer, and crop protectants were the most important farm supplies sold for both types of marketing cooperatives. Balance Sheet Definitions Balance sheet assets represent what the coopera- tive owns and are usually listed in decreasing order of their liquidity--the time it would take to convert them to cash. Liabilities, or what the cooperative owes toothers, are usually presented in a similar decreasing order. Equity represents members’ investment in their cooperative. Current assets- These are the most liquid assets on the cooperative balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents represent monies either in the bank, in short-term investments, or on hand at the cooperative. Accounts receivable is money due the cooperative (i.e., a credit sale due from the customer in 90 days). Inventories are products the cooperative has purchased from patrons to market and supplies the cooperative hopes to sell to patrons. Prepaid expenses are those paid up-front and then expensed as period costs throughout the fiscal year (i.e., taxes or insurance). Investments in other cooperatives- represent equity held in regional cooperatives through whom local cooperatives market products or purchase supplies and equity in the Bank for Cooperatives or CoBank, their lending source. These investments are purchased Table z+-Average  and total number of branches Cooperative type Average Farm supply .92 Mixed farm supply 1.79 Mixed marketing 1.78 Marketing 2.33 All 1.43Total 55 122 178 177 643Cooperative size Average Total Small .36 55 Medium .95 96 Large 1.59 153 Super 4.52 339 Table &Average  farm supplies sold and products marketed as a percent of tOtSI Saks, and change from 1994 to1995 Item 1995 1994 change, 1994 to1995 Percent Farm supplies sold: Feed 9.22 10.17 1.48 Seed .90 .98 3.05 Fertilizer 10.45 10.44 12.10 Crop protectants 7.42 7.87 5.52 Petroleum products 12.64 13.20 7.23 Other 4.91 5.29 3.04 Total 45.54 47.95 6.33 Products marketed: Grains and oilseeds 53.79 52.05 25.59 Other .67 - - Total 54.46 52.05 9.10 Total sales 100.00 100.00 11.96 Based on sales of: $12,203,699 $10,900,239 3equity as well as equity (patronage) paid back to the cooperative based on use. The more sales through or purchases from the regional cooperative or borrowing from the bank, the larger the investment. Other assets are usually past due accounts receivable not yet con- sidered as bad debt losses. Property, plant, and equipment- are the fixed assets of the cooperative (i.e., grain bins, office equipment, warehouse, gas station). Accumulated depreciation is the sum of all the year’s depreciation expenses taken on the assets. Net property, plant, and equipment (PPQE)  is the book value of the fixed assets-their cost minus accumulated depreciation. Total assets- are what the cooperative owns-current assets, plus investments, plus net fixed assets equal total assets. Current liabilities- are obligations the cooperative must pay within the next year. Accounts payable is money owed, usually to suppliers (sometimes classi- fied as accounts payable-trade accounts). Accrued expenses and accrued taxes are unpaid expenses. They often include unpaid salaries and benefits earned by employees. Accrued taxes often include property and sales taxes that have been incurred but not yet paid. Other liabilities in this study are most often accounts payable-grains and oilseeds  delivered and sold to the cooperative by its patrons who have not yet been paid. Retired equity represents allocated equity that the board has approved to revolve to members but not yet paid as of the closing date of the books. This equity accu- mulated from past sales to or purchases from patrons-usually revolved to members on a set sched- ule (often 7 or more years later). Patronage refunds and dividends are monies declared but not yet paid to mem- bers for current use of the cooperative and for invest- ing in preferred stock. Cooperatives are required to pay at least 20 per- cent of their refunds in cash, with the rest becoming allocated equity to be revolved to the members at a later date. The refunds are based on cents per product (weight or bushel) sold and/or on a percent of the dol- lars of farm supplies purchased. The refunds are deter- mined by the board of directors. Dividends paid on preferred stock ownership are based on a set percent return on the investment. Current portion of Zong-term debt and seasonal short-term debt are the final current lia- bilities. They are money owed (principal) for borrow-ing money and for leases. Long-term debt typically is used to finance long-term assets, while short-term debt is usually used for operating or seasonal loans. Long-term debt- includes notes, bonds, mortgages, and leases not due within the current year. Member equities- are member and patron invest- ments in the cooperative. The two main types are allo- cated and unallocated. Allocated equity is assigned to members in one of two forms. Each member has one share and one vote. The other form includes noncash allocated certificates which are member investments in the cooperative based on use. Allocated equity could be classified as stock if the cooperative was incorporated or certificates of owner- ship if not incorporated. In most cases, cooperative stock or ownership certificates are not generally traded between members and, if sold, require board approval. Unallocated equity is the retained earnings of the cooper- ative and often thought of as nonmember-nonpatron- age business but can also be based on member business. Analysis of the Balance Sheet The balance sheet of a local cooperative states its financial position at the end of an operating period-a 1Zmonth  fiscal year. The balance sheet represents the cooperative’s assets, liabilities, member equity, and their relationship to each other. This report analyzes the balance sheets of 432 local cooperatives to provide examples of typical levels for assets, liabilities, and member equities for different sizes and types. Table 5 compares common size balance sheets for all respondents for 1995 and 1994. Appendix tables l-4 show common size balance sheets by size and type for 1995. In a common size balance sheet, each account is listed as a percentage of total assets. The dollar amount of total assets the balance sheets represent is listed at the bottom of the table. By cooperative size, total assets increased from $1.5 million for small coop- eratives to $16.2 million for super-size cooperatives (table 7). By cooperative type, total assets were $2.7 million for farm supply, $6.2 million for mixed farm supply, $7.8 million for mixed marketing, and $9 mil- lion for marketing (table 8). Current Assets Looking first at current assets, cash and cash equivalents as a percent of total assets decreased as cooperative size increased.

By size, farm supply invento- ries increased about 10 percent more for large and super cooperatives and by type, about 5 percent more for both farm supply cooperatives. Grains and oilseeds inventories increased more than 55 percent for medi- um and super cooperatives. By type, they increased more than 50 percent for all but farm supply coopera- tives. There were also regional differences in inventory buildup. By looking at 103 cooperatives that had their grains and oilseeds  inventories increase more than 50 percent, 65 cooperatives were in Iowa, Minnesota, or Nebraska. In dollar terms, inventory increased $178 million, with $128 million in these three States. Part of this buildup was due to low grains and oilseeds  prices the prior year and farmers holding back sales. But a grain railcar  shortage in the upper Midwest also forced some cooperatives to resort to outdoor storage on the ground (with increased grain prices and especially corn prices, inventories of grains and oilseeds  can be expected to be much lower in FY 96). Interest expenses in the three States increased by $7 million, in part to finance these inventories. Local sav- ings fell $10 million and 30 cooperatives had losses in local income. Net income was up 16 percent for these cooperatives due to patronage refunds, so that only nine experienced losses. Accounts receivable in this study were farm sup- ply trade accounts, not grains and oilseeds  trade receivables. Farm supply and grains and oilseeds  trade receivables (“other” current assets) were separated to allow ratio analysis in a future section of this study. Accounts receivable for farm supply sales increased 7 percent, growing at about the same rate as the increase in farm supply sales. The age of accounts receivable refers to how long ago the sale that started this receivable was made. Most cooperatives have credit sales with discounts offered to promote prompt payment. Terms might be 2 percent-10 days, net 30 days (no discount). Discounts might be offered on all farm supply sales or on certain products. The terms and what products had discounts were not known, but 96 cooperatives listed their dis- count on sales, and it was 1.22 percent on total farm supply sales. The age of accounts receivable is known for 54 cooperatives for both years (table 6). Fifty-five percent were current. Another 14 percent were from 31 to 60 days old. The largest difference between the 2 years was nearly 12 percent of receivables were more than 6 months old compared with 8 percent in 1994.Table 6 Age of SCCOUM  receivable, 1995 and 1994 Accounts receivable age 1995 1994 Percent Current, 0 to 30 days 55.02 53.15 31 to 60 days 14.26 14.77 61 to 90 days 8.69 10.55 91 to 120 days 1.96 4.70 121 to 180 days 3.10 3.72 Greater than 6 months 11.63 7.70 Accounts written off this period 5.34 5.41 Based on accounts receivable of: $26,284,134  $24,160,885 Investments and Other Assets About 1.4 percent of cooperative’s total assets was invested in the Bank for Cooperatives or CoBank. Larger cooperatives and both types of marketing coop- eratives had comparable investments. Meanwhile, investments in other cooperatives dropped from a high of 26 percent for small cooperatives to 13 percent for super cooperatives. Across types, marketing coopera- tives had less invested than farm supply cooperatives. Other assets often included overdue accounts receiv- able and were generally less than 2 percent of total assets for all cooperative sizes and types (except large farm supply cooperatives, 4.2 percent). Property, Plant, and Equipment Net property, plant, and equipment (PP&E)  as a percent of total assets tended to be between 22 percent and 26 percent for all cooperative sizes. Net PP&E increased 6.5 percent from 1994. Cooperatives that handled grains and oilseeds  had higher dollar amounts of PP&E,  probably due to extensive grains and oilseeds  storage and handling facilities and, also, because these cooperatives were larger than farm sup- ply cooperatives. But, both farm supply cooperatives had growth in net W&E  of at least 9 percent while both marketing cooperatives were less than 5.5 per- cent. Current Liabilities Current liabilities grew 33 percent between 1994 and 1995. The largest increase was in notes payable- seasonal used to finance current operations, and usual- ly used for inventories, They grew from 11.2 percent of total assets to 16.5 percent. Farm supply cooperatives had a negligible change while mixed farm supply, mixed marketing, and marketing cooperatives all were up 5 percent.Table 7%Common  size balance sheets by cooperative size, 1995 Small Medium Large Super Assets Current assets Cash and cash equivalents Accounts receivable Inventories-grains and oilseeds -farm supplies Prepaid expenses Other current assets7.41 13.10 3.29 20.23 2.15 3.93Percent of fofal assets 4.59 3.03 14.05 11.96 11.38 18.46 14.11 12.68 64 63 5.07 6.541.93 9.07 31.21 9.15 .77 9.21 Total current assets Investments and other assets Investments-other cooperatives --Bank for Cooperatives50.11 50.04 53.50 61.34 26.20 22.51 17.95 12.72 .37 1.39 1.41 1.65 -total 26.57 23.90 19.36 14.37 Other assets 1.15 1.40 1.50 .53 Total investments & other assets Property, plant, and equipment At cost Less accumulated depreciation27.72 25.30 20.86 14.90 60.87 67.77 71.20 60.07 38.70 43.11 45.57 36.30 Net PP&E 22.17 24.66 25.64 23.76 Total assets 100.00 100.00 100.00 100.00 Liabilities and owner equities Current liabilities Current portion of long-term debt Notes payable-seasonal Accounts payable Patrons credii balances & other liabilities Accrued taxes Accrued expenses Patronage refunds (cash) Total current liabilities Long-term debt Total liabilities 27.86 37.73 47.11 58.76 Owner equities Allocated equity Unallocated equity1.76 3.05 4.11 3.12 6.35 9.29 13.09 22.19 6.38 5.88 6.09 4.35 6.19 9.13 12.94 18.74 .44 .55 .65 .71 1.30 1.42 1.65 1.52 1.31 1.38 1.31 1.10 23.73 30.70 39.84 51.73 4.13 7.03 7.27 7.03 53.64 45.70 39.58 30.02 18.50 16.57 13.31 11.22 Total owner equities 72.14 62.27 52.89 41.24 Total liabilities and owner equities Based on total assets of:100.00 100.00 100.00 100.00 $1,460,910 $3,558,985 $8,316,485 $16,249,985 7Table s-Common  Size balance sheets by cooperative type, 1995 Farm supply Mixed farm supply Mixed marketing Marketing Assets Current assets Cash and cash equivalents Accounts receivable Inventories-grains and oifseeds -farm supplies Prepaid expenses Other current assets Total current assetsPercent of total assets 5.34 2.78 2.66 2.30 13.59 15.15 10.41 7.09 0.00 16.32 27.53 35.66 23.11 12.33 9.79 6.16 2.05 .65 .68 .57 2.69 3.85 8.64 11.51 46.78 51.08 59.71 63.29 Investments and other assets Investments-other cooperatives -Bank for Cooperatives25.47 19.77 14.66 11.30 .72 1.39 1.67 1.69 -total 26.19 21.16 16.33 12.99 Other assets 2.12 1.31 .36 .63 Total investments & other assets Property, plant, and equipment At cost Less accumulated depreciation Net PP&E28.31 22.47 16.69 13.62 58.84 68.75 69.64 58.78 33.93 42.30 46.04 35.69 24.91 26.45 23.60 23.09 Total assets 100.00 100.00 100.00 100.00 Liabilities and owner equities Current liabilities Current portion of long-term debt Notes payable-seasonal Accounts payable Patrons credit balances & other liabilities Accrued taxes Accrued expenses Patronage refunds (cash)2.00 3.14 3.36 4.00 6.79 15.67 18.91 20.90 7.66 6.34 4.35 3.78 5.27 7.06 16.47 23.78 .51 .55 .76 .67 1.86 1.88 1.54 1.03 1.62 1.51 1.23 0.74 Total current liabilities Long-term debt Total liabilities Owner equities Allocated equity Unallocated equity Total owner equities Total liabilities and owner equities Based on assets of:25.71 36.15 46.62 54.90 7.42 7.81 5.97 6.77 33.13 43.96 52.59 61.67 52.05 45.05 32.67 26.52 14.82 10.99 14.74 11.81 66.87 56.04 47.41 38.33 100.00 100.00 100.00 100.00 $2,731,412 $6,180,969 $7,762,383 $9,046,959 8Patrons’ credit balances and other liabilities grew by 32 percent, mostly due to the inclusion of payables due on grains and oilseeds  trading and other market- ing activities. Accrued expenses and patronage refunds were the only other current liabilities that grew in double digits. Accrued expenses grew by 17.7 percent and were a slightly larger percentage of total assets for larger cooperatives and for both types of farm supply cooperatives. Cash patronage refunds and dividends grew by 15.5 percent, but was less than 2 percent of total assets for all sizes and types of cooperatives. Long-term Debt Long-term debt increased by 16.3 percent from 1994 to 1995. As a percent of total assets it generally increased with cooperative size, but interestingly, tended to be higher for both types of farm supply cooperatives. By type as a percent of total assets, long- term debt ranged from 6 percent to 7.8 percent with the farm supply cooperatives at the high end, about a percentage point higher than the marketing coopera- tives. Twenty-nine percent of the cooperatives had no long-term debt. About half were small farm supply cooperatives and combined together, farm supply cooperatives made up more than half. Nearly 66 percent of the cooperatives provided information that broke out four main sources of their $500 million total debt (short- and long-term com- bined)-Bank  for Cooperatives and CoBank,  commer- cial banks, debentures or notes, and other. A regional cooperative was most often the source in the “other” category. The local cooperative often purchases its farm supplies and markets its grains and oilseeds  through a regional cooperative, which becomes a source of debt capital. The debt may be short-term operating capital or long-term investment capital. Bank for Cooperatives and CoBank were the most frequent source of debt capital (59 percent). Others were regional cooperatives (32 percent), deben- tures or notes (5 percent), and commercial banks (4 percent). Most sources, except debentures and notes, extend lines of credit. Only 90 cooperatives reported their lines of credit for both years, but in total it increased by $20 million to $308 million in 1995. Of this line of credit, the unused portion fell by $20 mil- lion to $166 million in 1995. Member Equities Member equities to total assets represent the per- cent of the cooperative’s assets owned by the mem-bers, with creditors claiming the rest. Over all sizes and types of cooperatives, members averaged 50.3 per- cent ownership of the cooperative, down from 55.7 percent in 1994. Members of small cooperatives had the highest percentage of ownership (72.1 percent) while members of super-size cooperatives had the lowest (41.2 per- cent). By cooperative type, members of mixed farm supply cooperatives owned at least 56 percent of their cooperatives’ assets while farm supply cooperatives’ members owned more than 66 percent. Both types of marketing cooperatives had lower member owner- ship-38.3 percent for marketing and 47.4 percent for mixed marketing cooperatives. Member equities consisted of both allocated (pre- ferred, common, and other kinds of ownership certifi- cates) and unallocated equity. Allocated equity as a percentage of total assets was highest for small cooper- atives at 53.6 percent and more than 45 percent for both farm supply cooperatives. Unallocated equity averaged more than 13 per- cent of total assets for all sizes and types, but fell as cooperative size increased. By type, unallocated equity was around 15 percent of total assets for farm supply and mixed marketing cooperatives and around 11 per- cent to 12 percent for mixed farm supply and market- ing cooperatives. Description of Income Statement The income statement shows the results of opera- tions for the past year and usually includes both the current and prior year. It lists all sources of revenue and expenses. The statement measures the profitability of the cooperative for a given period of time. Although it does not show timing of cash-flows, the statement best describes the status of the business. In the analysis of income statements, net sales were set at 100 percent to find out the proportion that a single item represented in a total group or subgroup. Because the income statement variables were expressed as a percent of net sales, comparisons were possible between different sizes and types of opera- tions. Thus, the statement used in this report became known as a “common size” income statement. This statement was provided for the average cooperative respondent in table 9. The first item listed on the income statement net sales was the primary source of revenue-farm supplies sold and products marketed. Cost of goods sold (COGS) was the amount a cooperative paid for the products it sold and market- 9Table 9-hICOI?W  Statt?t?Wnt  and change in SCCOUntS,  19%  t0 1995 1995 1994 Percent change Net sales Cost of goods sold Gross margin Service and other income Gross revenue Operating expenses Employee: Salaries and wages Payroll taxes Employee insurance Pension expense Total Administrative: Professional services Office supplies (includes postage) Telephone, markets Meetings and travel Donations Dues and subscriptions Directors’ fees and expense Annual meetings expense Total General: Advertising and promotion Delivery (auto & truck) expense Insurance Property & Business taxes Other taxes and licenses Rent and lease expense Plant supplies & repairs Repairs and maintenance Utilities (includes dryer expense) Miscellaneous expenses Other expenses Total Depreciation Interest expense Bad debts Total expenses Local savings Patronage refunds received Savings before income taxes Less income taxes Net income Based on sales of:100.00 90.06 9.94 3.98 13.92Percent of net sales 100.00 89.87 10.13 3.79 13.927.82 8.05 5.83 13.26 7.85 4.69 4.36 15.97 .37 .36 9.31 .49 .50 6.78 .14 .14 12.94 5.69 5.36 7.16 .16 .13 34.45 .16 .16 7.72 .09 .09 7.18 .07 .07 7.52 .Ol .Ol 9.92 .03 .03 15.51 .03 .03 6.26 .02 .02 3.93 57 .54 13.66 .16 .16 8.81 .68 .63 16.27 .49 .51 2.83 .33 .34 3.55 .15 .17 (4.96) .20 .20 9.28 .22 .20 21.74 .68 .65 12.85 .49 .51 3.08 .12 .ll 17.21 .32 .39 (14.35) 3.84 3.87 18.00 1.53 1.54 7.33 .89 .68 42.42 .ll .lO 17.16 12.63 12.09 12.65 1.29 1.83 (23.98) 1.41 1.11 36.55 2.70 2.94 (1.03) .31 .68 (51 .Ol) 2.39 2.26 14.01 $12,187,025 $11,302,965 10ed-cost to the cooperative for the supplies sold and payments to farmers for products marketed. Net sales less COGS represented the gross margin on sales. Service and other income came mainly from pro- viding services to cooperative patrons. Service includ- ed delivery, chemical and fertilizer application, grain drying, and storage. Although substantial for some cooperatives, service income was not considered a pri- mary source of revenue. Operating expenses were those incurred in the course of conducting normal business. They were usu- ally classified by function like employee, administra- tive, general, and depreciation, interest, and bad debts. Local savings resulted from operations before taxes and patronage refunds from other cooperatives. Patronage refunds were based on volume of business conducted with another cooperative and were depen- dent on the other cooperative’s net income. Usually, this income was allocated equity and not actual cash coming into the respondent cooperatives. Net income was the end result of operations for that year. Distribution of net income was not part of the income statement. The board of directors decides how to distribute net income or allocate a net loss. Analysis of the Income Statement The income statement displays the net results of cooperative operations. Because most managers’ per- formance is judged by net income, members attach great importance to the income statement. In the fol- lowing sections, the underling values of the income statement are studied. Table 9 presents a common size income statement for 432 cooperatives and the change between 1994 and 1995. Appendix tables 5 to 8 show common size income statements by size and type for 1995. Net Sales The first item of the income statement analyzed in this report was net sales. It was determined by sub- tracting sales discounts and returns and allowances from gross sales. The average net sales for the 432 cooperatives in 1995 was $12.2 million, up $0.9 million or 7.8 percent from 1994. Net sales by cooperative size are presented in table 10, and by type in table 11. All sizes and types of cooperatives experienced a growth in net sales from 1994. If assets from tables 7 and 8 are compared to net sales in tables 10 and 11, sales for all types (except marketing) and sizes are about twice the level of assets.Cost of Goods Sold Cost of goods sold (COGS) represented the largest single component of expenses, usually expressed as a percent of net sales. For this study, COGS includes the beginning inventory plus purchas- es and freight costs, minus purchase returns and allowances, purchase discounts, and ending inventory. So, for these cooperatives, COGS was the purchase price of the farm supplies sold or products marketed. Table 11 shows COGS as a percent of net sales for the different types of cooperatives. Both types of market- ing cooperatives had a relatively high COGS when compared with farm supply cooperatives, which was to be expected because they were generally marketing grains and oilseeds  for their patrons with only a few cents per bushel margin. There was negligible change in COGS by cooperative size and type between the 2 years. Gross Margins Gross margins were the excess of net sales over the cost of goods sold. The gross margin averaged 9.9 percent for all cooperatives, down from 10.1 percent in 1994. The gross margin or gross margin percentage is a very important operating ratio. A small change in the gross margin has a tremendous impact on local sav- ings. A cooperative manager must maintain a gross margin near industry averages. Thus, least cost sources of supplies need to be developed and marketing coop- eratives must pay market rates on the products they purchase. Cooperatives are often characterized as business- es that provide goods and services “at cost.” However, a cooperative cannot operate at cost on a day-to-day basis. Therefore, unless a cooperative has an adequate gross margin, it can neither be profitable nor afford to finance essential future-directed discretionary expen- ditures such as expansion and advertising. Because by definition, gross margin equals net sales less cost of goods sold, those cooperatives with higher COGS had lower gross margins. COGS were higher for marketing and larger cooperatives, so gross margins as a percent of net sales were highest for farm supply and small cooperatives. Farm supply coopera- tives-16.7 percent-had the highest gross margin. Although both types of farm supply cooperatives had less business volume than those that performed mar- keting activities, their gross margin percentage was from 6 to 10 percentage points higher. Small coopera- tives, mostly selling farm supplies, had the highest gross margin by size (15.6 percent). 11Table w-Abbreviated income statement as a percent of net sales for cooperatives by size, 1995 Small Medium Large Super Percent of net sa/es Net sales 100.00 100.00 100.00 100.00 Cost of goods sold 64.36 67.66 89.08 91.98 Gross margin 15.64 12.34 10.92 a.02 Service and other income 3.63 4.16 4.07 3.94 Gross revenue 19.27 16.50 14.99 11.96 Expenses Employee 1 9.23 7.22 6.52 4.58 Administrative * 1.10 .79 .59 -44 General 3 4.35 3.78 3.56 3.35 Depreciation 2.11 1.97 1.74 1.46 Interest .68 .a2 .90 1.03 Bad debts .23 .24 .ia .06 Totalexpenses 17.70 14.82 13.49 10.92 Local savings 1.57 1.68 1.50 1.04 Patronage refunds received 2.36 1 .a4 1.49 1.12 Savings before income taxes 3.93 3.52 2.99 2.16 Less income taxes .24 .42 .49 .20 Net income 3.69 3.10 2.50 1.96 Based on total sales of: $2,599,834 $7,010,685 $13,819,360 !§37,104,303 t Employee expenses include salaries and wages, payroll taxes, employee insurance, unemployment compensation, and pension expense. 2 Administrative costs include professional services, office supplies, telephone, meetings and travel, donations, dues and subscriptions, directors’ fees and expense, and annual meetings. 3 General expenses include advertising and promotion, delivery (auto and truck), insurance, property, business and other taxes and licenses, rent and lease expenses, plant supplies and repairs, repairs and maintenance, utilities, miscellaneous, and other. Gross margins vary not only by cooperative, but also by farm supply sold or product marketed. Cooperatives, like other businesses, have different margins for different products. For 100 cooperatives that provided their individual product gross margins, these margins are shown in table 12. Margins vary due to product type and competition. For instance, fertiliz- er sold by the truckload has a different margin than a sale of a single bag. The services offered in conjunction with a sale (e.g., fertilizer spread on the field by a cooperative truck) have an impact on margin. Margins are also subject to competition. The gross margin dis- cussed in the first paragraph of this section is a blend- 12ed margin, made up of the margins of all products the cooperative sold, services rendered, and products mar- keted. The highest weighted (by volume) gross margin for the five main farm supplies was for fertilizer with a gross margin of almost 19 percent. The maximum mar- gin on fertilizer of 46 percent was for a small amount, probably a speciality fertilizer sold by the bag. Feed and petroleum margins were both around 17 percent. The margin of -302 percent on seed looks incorrect and needs further explanation. This margin was from a cooperative with more than $6 million in grains and oilseeds  sales that sold $1,500 of seed for $400.

For example, the two cooperatives with the lowest margins were located in close proximity and of course, in head-to-head competition. On further analysis, both cooperatives have been profitable over the past 5 years and have increased sales. They have even discussed merger, but membership has resisted this change. In this one instance, their low margins may be equated to low product prices-something that their members have noted by increasing their purchases from both cooperatives.Grains and oilseeds  were the only products mar- keted where gross margins were known. Grains and oilseeds  margins were low, only around 4 percent. Around 10 cooperatives reported high grains and oilseeds  margins of 18 and 19 percent. These high mar- gins were all at mixed farm supply cooperatives that had feed sales. It is suspected that the high margins resulted from the grain and oilseed  content in livestock feeds sold rather than the commodities themselves. Service and Other Income Service and other income, for the most part, con- sisted of trucking services (both delivery of purchases to patrons and transfer of their products to market), custom application of fertilizers and crop protectants, and drying and storing of grains and oilseeds.

This income averaged between 3.6 percent and 5 percent of net sales for all sizes and types of cooperatives. Other income was derived from non-operating sources such as interest and finance charges. This income included interest on cash equivalents and interest charged on credit sales. Other income also came from the sale of property, plant, and equipment, rentals, and extraordinary items. Sometimes property, plant, and equipment was sold to generate income, but usually it was the sale of a fully depreciated asset where the market value was greater than the book value. In some cases, disposal of a fully depreciated asset may mean a loss to the coop- erative. Rental income from unused facilities or equip- ment provided income flows. Extraordinary items might be either a gain or a loss. A gain could result from a fire loss where the insurance settlement was greater than the book value of the asset. A loss might be from flood damage for which the cooperative had no coverage. Operating Expenses Operating expenses were divided into four main categories-employee; administrative; general; and depreciation, interest, and bad debts. Employee expenses, of course, were related to labor costs. Administrative expenses included a variety of over- head costs associated with a cooperative and indirectly related to revenue production. General expenses were those directly related to revenue production, The bulk were in employee, general, and depreciation categories. 14Employee Expenses Employee expenses included salaries, wages, and benefits (payroll taxes, employee insurance, unem- ployment compensation, and pension expense) and averaged 5.7 percent of net sales for all respondent cooperatives. Employee expenses, up 7.2 percent from 1994, represented the smallest increase of all the major expense categories. As a percent of net sales, employee expenses decreased as cooperative size increased. This expense decreased from 9.2 percent of net sales for small coop- eratives to 4.6 percent for super cooperatives. By type, employee expenses as a percent of net sales were 9.6 percent for farm supply cooperatives and 3.4 percent for marketing cooperatives. About 62 percent of the cooperatives (268) pro- vided employee numbers and expenses (table 13). These expenses were for all employees. To equate part- time to full-time employees for purposes of this study, four part-time employees were considered as one full- time equivalent employee.3 Based on that calculation, the expense for a single employee averaged $30,119 for an average 19 employees, up 4 percent from 1994. By size, they ranged from $26,982 for small to $33,010 for super cooperatives and by type from $27,611 for those selling only farm supplies to $33,481 for mixed market- ing cooperatives. Small cooperatives averaged 8 actual full-time employees (excludes part-time), medium, 16; 3 Based on previous research conducted by CS economist David E. Cummins.Table wCalculated  salaries (using both full- and part-time employee expenses) and actual number of full- time employees, 1995 Small Medium Large Super All Farm supply salaries number of employees$26,349 9$31,151 21$28,391 44$30,600 42$27,611 14 Mixed farm supply salaries 28,144 31,452 32,324 33,394 31,596 number of employees 9 18 34 59 28 Mixed marketing salaries 31,568 31,704 34,832 34,106 33,481 number of employees 6 11 20 50 25 Marketing salaries 29,634 29,268 32,443 31,864 31,213 number of employees 4 6 11 39 19 All salaries 26,982 31,039 32,634 33,010 30,119 number of employees 8 16 24 47 19 Table I.+Board  member SalarieS Cooperative type Salaries Cooperative size Salaries Farm supply $576 Mixed farm supply 1,087 Mixed marketing 559 Marketing 739 Average of all 684Small $364 Medium 639 Large 870 Super 1,306 large, 24; and super, 47. Farm supply cooperatives averaged 14 employees, mixed farm supply, 28; mixed marketing, 25; and marketing, 19. Cooperatives with a significant proportion of their sales as farm supplies tended to be more labor intensive. Operating a feed mill or service station, applying chemicals and fertilizers, and selling hard- ware required the use of several employees. For instance, a small farm supply cooperative had 9 full- time employees while a small marketing cooperative used fewer employees-often only a manager, book- keeper, and two others. Administrative Expenses Administrative expenses were indirectly related to generating income. Managers usually had more con- trol over administrative expenses than any other cost. In years when revenues were down, managers could reduce expenses in this area more easily than in other categories. Administrative costs include professional services, donations, dues and subscriptions, directors’ fees and expenses, annual meetings, meetings and travel, office supplies, and telephone and market infor- mation.Professional services (such as legal, accounting, and computer) and office supplies both comprised 0.16 percent of net sales-the largest administrative expense. In total, administrative expenses were less than 0.6 percent of net sales. These expenses fell from a high of 1.1 percent for small cooperatives to 0.44 per- cent for super cooperatives. As cooperative size increased, the highest administrative expense, profes- sional services, fell as the cooperative relied more on its own employees to perform these tasks rather than purchase the services. Although directors’ fees and expenses were a small part of total costs, director compensation was important to many cooperatives to get farmers to sacri- fice time normally spent on their own operations to devote several hours of service each month to guiding their cooperative. Table 14 shows the number of direc- tors and their compensation for 282 cooperatives in 1995. Board expenses seemed rather modest, averaging $684  per director. The average board had seven direc- tors. By size, small cooperatives paid directors the least ($364) and super paid the most ($1,306). By type, mixed farm supply cooperatives paid the most at $1,087 per director. 15General Expenses General expenses were usually fixed in the short run and associated with income production. These expenses included advertising and promotion, deliv- ery (auto and truck), general insurance, property, busi- ness and other taxes and licenses, rent and lease expenses, plant supplies and repairs, repairs and main- tenance, utilities (including dryer expenses), miscella- neous, and other. Most of these expenses (with the exception of advertising and promotion) were not under direct management control. General expenses averaged 3.8 percent of net sales in 1995, Repairs and maintenance and delivery expenses at 0.68 percent of net sales were the largest in the general category, followed by insurance and utili- ties, both at 0.49. By cooperative size, general expenses were 4.4 for small cooperatives and 3.4 for super coop- eratives. By cooperative type, these expenses were around 5 percent of net sales for farm supply coopera- tives and around 3 for marketing cooperatives. Depreciation, Interest, and Bad Debts Depreciation expense averaged 1.5 percent of net sales; interest, 0.9 percent; and bad debts, 0.1 percent. By cooperative size, depreciation expense as a percent of net sales was 2.1 percent for small cooperatives and 1.5 percent for super cooperatives. By cooperative type, depreciation expense was 2.2 percent of net sales for farm supply cooperatives, 1.5 percent for mixed marketing, and 1.2 percent for marketing cooperatives. As discussed earlier, interest expenses, especially for short-term borrowing increased dramatically, going from 0.7 percent of net sales in 1994 to 0.9 percent in 1995. Interest expenses were lowest among small coop- eratives at 0.7, but grew to more than 1 percent for super cooperatives. By type, interest expenses were about 0.9 percent for all cooperatives except mixed farm supply which was highest at 1.1 percent.Bad debts as a percent of net sales fell as coopera- tive size increased-O.2 for small cooperatives and 0.1 for super cooperatives. By cooperative type, bad debts were 0.2 for both farm supply cooperatives and around 0.1 for both marketing cooperatives. Local Savings Local savings or local income was generated from own operations (before taxes and patronage refunds from other cooperatives). Local savings as a percent of net sales was highest for small cooperatives (1.6 per- cent) and lowest for super cooperatives (1 percent). By type, local savings was the highest for farm supply cooperatives (1.9 percent) and the lowest for market- ing cooperatives (0.8 percent). Small cooperatives, and especially farm supply cooperatives, had higher local savings than larger marketing cooperatives. About 24 percent of the cooperatives in this study had losses. While small cooperatives have higher returns on net sales, 50 or one-third of them lost money. Table 15 shows losses by size and type. Thirty percent of the mixed farm supply cooperatives lost money. Most likely to lose money were small mixed farm supply cooperatives (57 percent). Patronage Refunds Received Patronage refunds received or income from other cooperatives resulted from locals doing business with other cooperatives, generally regionals, or cooperative banks such as CoBank or the Bank for Cooperatives. The patronage refund from regionals was based on business volume and consisted of cash refunds and equity stock. The equity stock was usually revolved back to the local cooperative on a set schedule. Many respondent cooperatives also borrowed funds from CoBank and the Bank for Cooperatives and received both cash and noncash  patronage income.

Patronage refunds reflect the volume of business with regional cooperatives, CoBank or the Bank for Cooperatives. The dollar amount of patronage refunds between 1994 and 1995 was up 37 percent, suggesting 1995 must have been a good year for regional coopera- tives, CoBank, or the Bank for Cooperatives. Patronage refunds received were 2.4 percent of net sales for small cooperatives and 1.1 percent for super cooperatives. By cooperative type, patronage refunds received as a per- cent of net sales were higher for farm supply coopera- tives than for marketing cooperatives. Patronage refunds were an important source of revenues. They allowed 71 (out of 102) cooperatives that had local losses to have net income. Income Taxes Cooperatives paid income taxes on earnings not allocated to members (retained earnings) and on divi- dend payments. The decision as to what amounts of income that were allocated to retained earnings and to members was made by the board of directors. The treatment of nonmember business has an impact on retained earnings because the cooperative could allo- cate the earnings to nonmembers or retain the income. In terms of net sales, income tax paid was 0.3 percent of net sales in 1995. Income tax paid by cooperatives varied by size and type. Small cooperatives paid income taxes equal to 0.2 percent of their net sales, medium, 0.4; large, 0.5; and super, 0.2. All cooperatives except mixed market- ing ( 0.5 percent) paid 0.2 percent of their net sales in income taxes. Net Income Net income is the term used here for profits on cooperative income statements.

For small cooperatives it was 3.7 percent of net sales, medium, 3.1 percent; large, 2.5 percent; and super, 2 percent. By cooperative type, farm supply had returns of 4.1 percent on net sales, mixed farm supply had 3.2 percent, mixed marketing cooperatives, 2.1 percent, and marketing cooperatives, 1.5 percent. Net income (before taxes) was generally distrib- uted five ways-non-cash patronage allocations, cash patronage refunds, retained earnings, income taxes, and dividends on patron’s equity (table 16). Nearly 53 percent of net income before taxes was held as non- cash patronage allocations by the 287 cooperatives that provided income allocations. Cash patronage refunds were 22 percent. All distributions of income were basi- cally unchanged from 1994. Only 9 of the 287 coopera- tives reported dividends on preferred stock. The effec- tive interest paid was 3.22 percent. Financial Ratio Analvsis Looking beyond levels of assets, liabilities, mem- ber equities, sales, and expenses, cooperative man- agers and boards of directors need comparative mea- sures to evaluate their cooperative’s financial performance. Standard ratios were used in this report, includ- ing financial ratio analysis that allow performance comparisons between years and different cooperatives. No single financial indicator will provide enough information to determine a cooperative’s financial health. Therefore, ratios must be carefully interpreted. It is important to look at a group of financial ratios over a period of time, evaluate other cooperatives with similar sales and functions, and/or compare perfor- mance with other cooperatives in the same geographi- cal area. Ratios used in this study were often chosen because of their comparability with prior studies. Therefore, most figures show ratios for the 11-year period for all 1,610 cooperatives. Data for 1994 and 1995 reflect information gathered from the same 432 cooperatives that reported for both years. Performance ratios measure various levels of cooperative operations and generally have both a financial and operational impact. Four categories were used-liquidity, leverage, activity, and profitability. Many factors underlie each ratio and examining one ratio may not help pinpoint problems. Net income before taxes: Number of cooperatives:$101,171,588  $94,112,032 287 330 17Liquidity Ratios Liquidity ratios, such as current and quick, mea- sure the cooperative’s ability to meet short-term oblig- ations. They focus on the cooperative’s ability to remain solvent. The current ratio is current assets divided by current liabilities. However, this ratio does not consider the degree of liquidity of each of the com- ponents of current assets. In other words, if the current assets of a cooperative were mainly cash, they would be much more liquid than if comprised of mainly inventory. If the ratio is less than 1, current liabilities exceed current assets and the cooperative’s liquidity is threat- Figure i-Current and Quick Ratios Ratio 21 4-=-Quick 0 ’IIIIIIIII 1985 868788899092939495ened.  Improvements in this ratio can be achieved by selling additional capital stock, borrowing additional long-term debt, or disposing of unproductive fixed assets and retaining proceeds. Current liabilities may also be reduced by retaining a greater portion of allo- cated savings (reducing the cash portion). A high current ratio is a favorable condition financially because it indicates the ability to pay cur- rent liabilities from the conversion of current assets into cash. Operationally, this same high ratio tends to increase operating freedom and reduce the probability of bill-paying difficulty from writedowns of accounts receivable or inventory. Figure 1 shows the current and quick ratios for the surveyed cooperatives. The current ratio was relatively constant for 3 years before it took a slight downturn in 1995. The total current assets increased 24 percent while total current liabilities increased 33 percent. From 1994 to 1995, grains and oilseeds  and farm sup- ply inventories and dividends on equity were the only elements of current liabilities that grew. Higher grain and oilseed  inventories are probably causing the 32- percent increase in patron credit balances and other liabilities (which contains grain trade payables). The current ratio fell as cooperative size increased. The ratio was highest for small cooperatives (2.11) and fell to 1.19 for super cooperatives (table 17). By cooper- ative type, the ratio was 1.15 for marketing coopera- tives and 1.82 for farm supply cooperatives (table 18). Quick ratio is current assets minus inventories, divided by current liabilities. Inventories are exclud- ed-the least liquid of all current assets. All elements of this ratio have increased.

Operationally, the results are the same as with current ratio. The quick ratio mimicked the movement of the current ratio. Small cooperatives (1.12) had the highest ratio and it decreased as size increased to 0.41 for super cooperatives (table 17). The quick ratio ranged from a low of 0.39 for marketing cooperatives to a high of 0.92 for farm supply cooperatives. This ratio was highest in 1986 and lowest in 1995 (figure 1).

They help to analyze the use of debt and the ability to meet obligations in times of crisis. Debt-to-asset ratio is defined as total debt divided by total assets. Elements of this ratio include long-term debt plus short-term debt and total assets. Long-term debt increased at the same rate as total assets, which may indicate some short-term obligations were being carried and converted to long-term debt. With invento- ries increasing in the short term, quick financing is needed, usually through the use of short-term debt. In fact, short-term debt increased 72 percent between 1994 and 1995 (table 5). Lenders would rather see a low ratio indicating the cooperative’s ability to repay the loan. Overall, this ratio increased from .21 to .27 because assets increased by 17 percent while debt increased by almost one-half (figure 2). Reducing debt, increasing savings, or financing a greater portion of assets with working capital may improve this ratio. Larger cooperatives were financing more of their assets with debt, but the highest ratio for any size or type of cooperative was still only 0.32 (table 17). Small cooperatives had the lowest use of debt at 0.12. Debt usage was highest for marketing cooperatives at 0.32. This was twice the ratio for farm supply cooperatives. By type, farm supply cooperatives had the lowest use of debt. Debt-to-equity ratio is calculated by dividing long- term debt by member equity. This ratio shows the financial flexibility and the long-term capital structure of the cooperative. High ratios indicate inadequate borrowing power of the cooperative.

A low ratio is more favorable and finan- cially impacts the cooperative through independence on outside sources of funds relative to owners’ equity. A low ratio may also have an unfavorable impact indi- cating low return on equity. Operationally, a low ratio tends to reduce interest cost. Improvement may be gained by reducing long-term debt by disposing of unproductive assets and using proceeds to liquidate debt, or accelerating payments on long-term loans. Other ways include increasing local equity by generat- ing higher levels of local savings, slowing down equity retirement programs, selling additional capital stock, or retaining a greater portion of allocated savings. As cooperative size grew, so did their use of long- term debt. The ratio for small cooperatives was 0.06 Table w-Financial analysis ratios for all cooperatives, 1995and1994 Ratio 1995 1994 Current 1.32 1.41 Quick 0.52 0.65 Debts-to-assets 0.27 0.21 Debt-to-equity 0.14 0.12 Times-interest-earned 3.65 4.65 Total-asset-turnover 2.16 2.34 Fixed-asset-turnover 6.93 8.83 Gross profit margin 9.94 10.13 Return on total assets before interest &taxes 8.04 8.66 Return on allocated equity 13.96 12.65 Figure %--Debt-To-Equity Ratio Percent 0.35 0.30 0.25 1985 86 67 88 89 90 92 93 94 95 20and 0.17 for super cooperatives (table 17). Marketing cooperatives had, at 0.18, the highest ratio by type, while farm supply cooperatives were the lowest at 0.11. When looking at the trend, the ratio increased slightly each year from 1992 to 1995, but is much lower than prior years (figure 3). Times-interest-earned ratio  is the number of times interest expense is covered by earnings. It is calculated by dividing earnings before interest and taxes by inter- est expense. A ratio of one or more indicates the ability of current earnings to pay current interest expenses. Lending institutions are more apt to loan to coopera- tives whose times-interest-earned ratio is more than one (1) because it shows their ability to pay interest payments. Subsequently, a lending institution may lend funds at lower rates more readily for capital improvements. Times-interest-earned ratio was higher for respondent cooperatives in 1993 before starting a slight downward trend for the next 2 years (figure 4). This ratio may be improved by collecting old receiv- ables, improving inventory turnover, disposing of assets and reducing debt with proceeds, or reducing debt with working capital. Financially, a high ratio impacts the return on equity and tends to increase it. Over time operationally, a high ratio will reduce inter- est cost. Interest coverage was the greatest for smaller cooperatives and generally fell as cooperative size increased to super cooperatives (table 17). By coopera- tive type, the ratio ranged from 2.81 for marketing to 6.04 for farm supply. Figure 4-Times-interest-Earned  Ratio Ratio ” 1985 86 87 88 89 90 92 93 94 95Activity Ratios Activity ratios measure how well cooperatives use assets. A low ratio could mean that the cooperative was overcapitalized or carrying too much inventory. A high ratio could be deceptive. A cooperative with fully depreciated older assets could have an artificially high ratio even though those assets were no longer operat- ing efficiently. Total-asset-turnover ratio was found by dividing net sales by total cooperative assets. This ratio has gone down slightly from 2.34 in 1994 to 2.16 in 1995 (figure 5). Both elements of this ratio increased-total sales by 8 percent and total assets by 17 percent. A high ratio exerts a favorable financial influence through the reduction of financial leverage and/or increased return on equity. A high ratio operationally tends to reduce interest costs. The ratio was higher for larger cooperatives (table 17). Super cooperatives had the highest ratio at 2.28, indicating the most efficient use of assets. By cooperative type, the total asset turnover ratio was higher for marketing than farm supply. The total asset turnover ratio was lowest in 1995 at 2.16 and highest in 1989 at 3.01. Fixed-asset-turnover ratio represents net sales divided by net property, plant, and equipment (PP&E). This ratio is similar to the total asset turnover ratio and shows how well the cooperative is using its fixed assets. This ratio by itself might not give a complete picture of the cooperative’s financial health. A cooper- ative with fully depreciated assets would have an arti- Figure ti--Total-  and Fixed-Asset-Turnover Ra tie 12 1 10 “I6 Total-asset-turnover 4 2-0’ ’I I 1 I I I I I I 1985a6a788a99092939495ficially  high ratio. A cooperative that invested heavily in PP&E  for future expansion will have a temporarily low ratio. After a high in 1989 of 10.20, this ratio has remained relatively level for the 1990s. In 1995, the ratio was 8.93 and increased slightly from 1994 because sales increased 8 percent while investment in fixed assets increased 7 percent. The measure for this ratio may or may not show favorable or unfavorable conditions. It simply reflects cooperative conditions. An abnormally high ratio usually indicates very old, nearly depreciated fixed assets or the leasing of prop- erty and equipment. A high ratio financially exerts a favorable influ- ence by increasing asset use, reducing financial lever- age, and/or increasing return on equity. A high ratio, operationally, tends to reduce depreciation and interest costs. It may also increase costs related to operating leases, personnel and travel or delivery expenses. This ratio may be improved by restricting further invest- ments in fixed assets; redesigning production, or office facilities to increase the sales generating potential of existing space and equipment; and/or selling idle machinery and parts, unused vehicles, and unneces- sary equipment. By size, a fixed-asset-turnover ratio of 9.61 was greatest for super cooperatives. By type, the ratio was the highest (10.49) for marketing cooperatives. The fixed-asset-turnover ratio was at its lowest in 1987 (fig- ure 51. Profitability Ratios Profitability ratios, such as gross profit margin, indicate the efficiency of the cooperative’s operations. Because a cooperative is owned by its user-members, many common industry profitability ratios have little meaning. For instance, profitability ratios measuring the return on common or preferred stock of similar investor-oriented firms are not appropriate because there is seldom an open market for cooperative stock. Gross profit margin is found by subtracting the cost of goods sold from, net sales and then dividing this amount (gross margin) by net sales. The gross profit margin is an important operating ratio. A small change in the gross margin has a tremendous impact on local savings. It indicates the cooperative’s pricing policy and cost of goods offered for sale. For all cooperatives, the gross profit margin aver- aged 9.94 percent in 1995. The gross profit margin was the highest for respondent cooperatives in 1993 at 10.76 percent (figure 6). By size, gross profit margin diminished as cooperative sales grew. At 15.64 percent, 21small cooperatives had the highest gross margin. By type, farm supply and mixed farm supply coopera- tives, at 16.68 percent and 14.94 percent, had the high- est margins in 1995 (table 18). Return on total assets measures the rate of return on total investment. It is calculated by dividing net income by total assets and usually calculated before interest and taxes. This ratio is a measure of perfor- mance. It is not sensitive to the leverage position of the cooperative. Although some assets were financed through debt, the ratio measures return to both mem- bers and lenders. This ratio declined by 0.62 percent to 8.04 percent between 1994 and 1995 (table 19). Net savings (before income taxes) declined 1 per- cent while interest expense increased 42 percent dur- ing the 2-year period (table 9). For the decade, this ratio was highest in 1992 and 1995 and has been fairly constant (figure 7). Operationally, a high ratio tends to reduce interest cost and financially indicates a compar- atively high rate of return on assets employed. Medium and large cooperatives had a higher return on total assets (table 17). Medium-sized cooper- atives were slightly higher at 8.54 percent. By coopera- tive type, return on total assets was highest for farm supply cooperatives at 9.27 percent. Assets relative to revenue were higher for both types of farm supply cooperatives. Return on allocated equity is net income divided by allocated equity. It was determined by subtracting unallocated equity from total member equities. It rep- resents member investment in their cooperative and is an important measure of profitability. Figure 6- Gross Profit Margin Percent ‘*tiThis ratio increased 1 percent in 1995 (table 19). This ratio is sensitive to the amount of debt capital in the cooperative and best used in conjunction with other measures such as the return on total assets. Net savings increased 14 percent while allocated equity increased 3 percent from 1994 to 1995. Financially, a high ratio is favorable and tends to decrease financial leverage. However, a high ratio may also be a symptom of low investment adequacy. Operationally, a high ratio tends to reduce interest cost over time but may occur when both total debt and interest costs are on the high side. By size, this ratio increased as the cooperative grew in size. Super cooperatives had the highest return on allocated equity (14.92 percent). Farm supply and mixed farm supply cooperatives ratios were 14.06 per- cent and 13.35 percent and marketing and mixed mar- keting cooperatives were 13.51 percent and 14.65 per- cent (table 18). Summary and Conclusions Local cooperatives studied in this report general- ly had strong financial statements. Assets increased 17 percent from 1994 to 1995. More than half of the accounts receivable were less than 30 days old. Investment in W&E  grew 7 percent. Owner equities grew 5 percent and member ownership in the local exceeds 50 percent. Net sales grew 8 percent. Total expenses grew 13 percent while net income grew slightly faster, at 14 percent.

They are also important to rural communities, often one of the largest employers, and provide considerable tax revenues. The extensive consolidation of local cooperatives during the past two decades reflects attempts to maintain an adequate size from which to provide their members with expanded products and markets. Despite consolidation, coopera- tives studied maintained an average of two branch locations from which to better serve members. These cooperatives maintained strong ties to regional cooperatives, CoBank  or the Bank for Cooperatives through which they obtained products, gained marketing opportunities, or borrowed needed capital. Investment in other cooperatives rose 8 percent from 1994. In turn, patronage refunds to local coopera- tives from regionals and the banks increased 37 per- cent and made the year profitable for 71 cooperatives that would have otherwise had losses. But, local coop- eratives cannot depend on large patronage refunds and with numerous locals losing money, further con- solidation of locals may be necessary in the future. An area of concern in the financial statements was the large buildup in inventories and subsequent increases in short-term debt. Grains and oilseeds inventories increased 51 percent; short-term debt climbed 72 percent and pushed up interest costs 42 percent. Inventory buildup and the subsequent growth in assets financed through additional debt had an impact on much of the ratio analysis: 1) Liquidity ratios, current and quick, declined slightly in 1995 due to increased grains and oilseeds  and farm supply inventories; 2) Leverage ratios-debt-to-total assets ratio, jumped from 0.21 in1994 to0.27 in1995 because assets increased 17 percent while debt increased almost 50 percent; 3) Activity ratios-total-asset-turnover ratio fell from 2.34 in 1994 to 2.16 in 1995 because total sales increased only 8 percent while assets increased 17 percent with much of the increase in inventories; and finallyBut increases in inventories are not expected to be a long-term trend. More current information sug- gests the inventory problem will be a non-issue in FY 1996. Prices for most grains and oilseeds  increased greatly this past year and most inventories were prob- ably liquidated to capture the higher prices. Other pressing issues are sure to arise in the coming year. Cooperatives are owned by their farmer/member/patrons. As long as those farmers want to own a business where they can purchase their supplies and market their products, cooperatives will continue to adapt to changing economic conditions.

Total assets reflect- ed increased inventory while increased interest costs lowered net income. 23Appendix table l-Common  size balance sheets for farm supply cooperatives, 1995 Cooperative size Item

Department of Agriculture Rural Business-Cooperative Service Stop 3250 Washington, D.C. 20250-3250 Rural Business-Cooperative Service (RBS) provides research, management, and educational assistance to cooperatives to strengthen the economic position of farmers and other rural residents. It works directly with cooperative leaders and Federal and State agencies to improve organization, leadership, and operation of cooperatives and to give guidance to further development. The cooperative segment of RBS (1) helps farmers and other rural residents develop cooperatives to obtain supplies and services at lower cost and to get better prices for products they sell; (2) advises rural residents on developing existing resources through cooperative action to enhance rural living; (3) helps cooperatives improve services and operating efficiency; (4) informs members, directors, employees, and the public on how cooperatives work and benefit their members and their communities; and (5) encourages international cooperative programs. FIBS also publishes research and educational materials and issues Rural Cooperatives magazine.

The statements of 432 cooperatives were used to compare 1995 to 1994, while 1,610 cooperatives were used to look at trends over the past 10 years. Cooperatives were divided into four groups based on their mix of net sales between supplies sold and farm products marketed. They were also divided into four size cate- gories, based on their total sales volume. Average net income increased 14 percent from 1994 to 1995. In 1995, average net sales for all cooperatives studied was $12.2 million, up 8 percent from 1994. More than 36 percent of the cooperatives studied were small cooperatives-sales of less than !§5 million. Cooperatives not only were important to their member/patrons, but also were an impor- tant asset to their rural communities. They were probably one of the community’s larg- er employers, employing an average 21 full-time and 9 part-time employees with an average annual payroll of $707,000. Petroleum products and fertilizer were the two principal farm supplies sold. Marketing activities (mainly grains and oilseeds) provided more than 54 percent of sales for these cooperatives. Average total assets grew 17 percent between 1994 and 1995, fueled by large increas- es in inventories. To finance the growth in assets (mainly inventories), total liabilities grew 31 percent while owner equities increased 5 percent. Interest expenses, although less than 1 percent of net sales, increased 42 percent largely due to increased short-term debt used to finance inventory buildup. Local sav- ings was down 24 percent, but with an increase of 37 percent in patronage refunds received, net income for these cooperatives was up 14 percent. Financial ratio analysis was used to look at 1 O-year trends for the 1,610 cooperatives in the data base. The financial ratio analysis revealed these findings: l The current ratio (current assets/current liabilities) was fairly steady around 1.5 between 1988 and 1994, with a slight downturn in 1995. The quick ratio (current assets-inventory/current liabilities) mimicked the current ratio’s trend. . Total debt-to-asset ratio was 0.25 in 1995, higher than most recent years but lower than the high of 0.3 in 1985. l The fixed-asset-turnover ratio, a measure of asset utilization, has averaged at least 9.1 for the past 3 years ( i.e., net sales were 9.1 times property, plant, and equipment levels). l Return on total assets measures the rate of return on total investments. At 8 percent, this measure was down slightly from 1994. l Return on allocated equity before taxes has grown dramatically in the decade from 5 percent to 14 percent. . . .111Analysis of Financial Statements: Local Farm Supply, Marketing Cooperatives E. Eldon Eversull and Beverly L. Rotan Rural Business-Cooperative Service U.S. Department of Agriculture Local agricultural cooperatives play a vital role in providing goods and services to their patrons and the rural community. This report analyzes their financial statements for comparative purposes for cooperative managers, directors, and members. Ratio analysis and trends will be discussed. The presentation is sub-divided into four cooperative sizes and types to make the information more useful. The 432 local cooperatives had farm supply sales (petroleum, fertilizer, feed, etc.) that averaged $5.6 mil- lion in 1995 while marketing sales (corn, wheat, soy- beans, etc.) averaged $6.6 million. Income from ser- vices (product delivery, fertilizer application, grains and oilseeds  hauling and storage, etc.) averaged SO.4 million per year. These cooperatives were not only important to, their member/patrons, but also an important asset to their rural communities. The cooperatives paid an average of $43,000 in annual property taxes. They were also a large employer in their communities, averaging 21 full-time and 9 part-time employees with an aver- age annual payroll of $707,000. Cooperative annual reports generally contain the balance sheet and a statement of operations. More detailed reports may contain a statement of changes in patrons’ equity and a statement of cash-flows along with explanations detailing various aspects of the financial statements. The manager and the president of the board of directors may also provide a statement on the cooperative’s past year operating results and future plans. This study focuses on the balance sheet, income statement, and financial ratios derived from these statements.Profile of Respondent Cooperatives Staff of the Cooperative Services (CS) program in USDA’s Rural Business-Cooperative Service annually survey farmer cooperatives. Data from this survey are used in this study. To be included, a cooperative had to sell some farm supplies. No cooperative that exclusive- ly markets members’ products was included. In addi- tion to selling farm supplies, the cooperative also had to provide an annual report that had a detailed income statement. There are 1,610 cooperatives in the CS Farm Supply and Services (FSS)  database. This report focus- es on 432 cooperatives that provided information in both 1995 and 1994 when comparing those years and on all 1,610 cooperatives when looking at long-term trends (1985 through 1993 ‘) in the financial ratio analysis section. To obtain a more complete under- standing of the local cooperatives’ business, informa- tion in this report is divided into a cross section of four sizes and four types. Cooperative Size Cooperatives were grouped into four sizes by sales volume, using actual figures. No attempt was made to deflate these values. Sales groupings used in this report were the same as in prior reports (see CS- RR 134 and RR 138) and, for the 432 cooperatives, sizes and types used are summarized in table 1. 1 The data in the FSS database does not include 1991. It was omitted in an effort to disseminate information in a more timely fashion. At the time, it was thought that information from 1991 would be included in the future, but as that information became less and less current, it is less likely to become part of the database. 1In classifying by total sales alone, product mix was ignored. For example, a cooperative with $10 mil- lion in sales that exclusively marketed grains and oilseeds  could be considered small relative to most grains and oilseeds  marketing organizations. But, a strictly farm supply cooperative with sales of $10 mil- lion, however, was quite substantial. Cooperative Type To account for differences in operations and ori- entation based on product mix, cooperatives were grouped into one of four descriptive categories: 1) farm supply; 2) mixed farm supply; 3) mixed market- ing; and 4) marketing. These descriptions were chosen to represent business operations of these cooperatives as closely as possible and their definitions summarized in table 1. This report focuses on cooperatives handling farm supplies-42 percent in 1995 sold only farm sup- plies; 16 percent were mixed; 24 percent were mixed marketing; and 18 percent were marketing (table 2). Of Table r-Size and type definitions used for respondent cooperatives Cooperative size Definition Number Small up to $5 million in total sales 156 Medium $5 million to $10 million 103 Large $10 million to $20 million 96 Super $20 million and more 75 Cooperative type Farm supply total net sales from farm supplies’ 161 Mixed farm supply from 50 to 99 percent 70 Mixed marketing from 25 to 49 percent 103 Marketing less than 25 percent 78 1 The definition of farm supply cooperatives differs from prior reports. These cooperatives now have 100 percent farm supply sales instead of 90 to 100 percent.the respondents, 36 percent were small; 24 percent, medium; 23 percent, large; and 17 percent, super. Both types of marketing cooperatives tended to be larger while the farm supply cooperatives were most often small. Most respondents were small farm supply coop- eratives. The first part of this report focuses on the 432 cooperatives that provided information in both 1995 and 1994. In the financial ratio analysis sections, data between the years were not completely comparable in that the same cooperatives did not respond to the CS survey every year. Information in the FSS database was not randomly selected and may not be statistically valid to draw industry-wide conclusions. However, the samples are large and represent a cross section of cooperatives selling farm supplies and marketing grains and oilseeds  throughout the United States. The information in this report also goes beyond 432 cooperatives and rural communities. These coop- eratives operated 643 branches and had a significant business impact on 1,075 rural communities in terms of taxes and employment (table 3). Super cooperatives that averaged almost five branch outlets impacted more rural communities. Marketing cooperatives had an average of two branch outlets. Sales Mix The respondent cooperatives had five major farm supply and two marketing categories (table 4). Petroleum was the dominant production supply item sold by small and medium cooperatives. Sales of small cooperatives, the most numerous, averaged $2.8 mil- lion in 1995. Farm production supplies represented the bulk (86 percent) of their sales. As cooperatives grew in size, the importance of farm supplies declined (64 percent for medium-sized cooperatives, 52 percent for large, and 32 percent for super). Table z-Respondent cooperatives by size and type Cooperative size Cooperative type Small Medium Large Super Total Number Percenf Farm supply 122 37 19 3 41.90 Mixed farm supply 14 23 22 11 16.20 Mixed marketing 12 28 33 30 23.84 Marketing a 15 24 31 18.06 Percent of total 36.11 23.84 22.69 17.36 100.00Sales of mixed farm supply cooperatives aver- aged $12 million with $5 million in farm supply sales. Petroleum was the most important farm supply item sold, with feed a close second. Average sales of marketing and mixed marketing cooperatives were $22 million and $18 million, respec- tively, and much larger than both categories of farm supply cooperatives. As defined, marketing made up the majority of their sales. Feed, fertilizer, and crop protectants were the most important farm supplies sold for both types of marketing cooperatives. Balance Sheet Definitions Balance sheet assets represent what the coopera- tive owns and are usually listed in decreasing order of their liquidity--the time it would take to convert them to cash. Liabilities, or what the cooperative owes toothers, are usually presented in a similar decreasing order. Equity represents members’ investment in their cooperative. Current assets- These are the most liquid assets on the cooperative balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents represent monies either in the bank, in short-term investments, or on hand at the cooperative. Accounts receivable is money due the cooperative (i.e., a credit sale due from the customer in 90 days). Inventories are products the cooperative has purchased from patrons to market and supplies the cooperative hopes to sell to patrons. Prepaid expenses are those paid up-front and then expensed as period costs throughout the fiscal year (i.e., taxes or insurance). Investments in other cooperatives- represent equity held in regional cooperatives through whom local cooperatives market products or purchase supplies and equity in the Bank for Cooperatives or CoBank, their lending source. These investments are purchased Table z+-Average  and total number of branches Cooperative type Average Farm supply .92 Mixed farm supply 1.79 Mixed marketing 1.78 Marketing 2.33 All 1.43Total 55 122 178 177 643Cooperative size Average Total Small .36 55 Medium .95 96 Large 1.59 153 Super 4.52 339 Table &Average  farm supplies sold and products marketed as a percent of tOtSI Saks, and change from 1994 to1995 Item 1995 1994 change, 1994 to1995 Percent Farm supplies sold: Feed 9.22 10.17 1.48 Seed .90 .98 3.05 Fertilizer 10.45 10.44 12.10 Crop protectants 7.42 7.87 5.52 Petroleum products 12.64 13.20 7.23 Other 4.91 5.29 3.04 Total 45.54 47.95 6.33 Products marketed: Grains and oilseeds 53.79 52.05 25.59 Other .67 - - Total 54.46 52.05 9.10 Total sales 100.00 100.00 11.96 Based on sales of: $12,203,699 $10,900,239 3equity as well as equity (patronage) paid back to the cooperative based on use. The more sales through or purchases from the regional cooperative or borrowing from the bank, the larger the investment. Other assets are usually past due accounts receivable not yet con- sidered as bad debt losses. Property, plant, and equipment- are the fixed assets of the cooperative (i.e., grain bins, office equipment, warehouse, gas station). Accumulated depreciation is the sum of all the year’s depreciation expenses taken on the assets. Net property, plant, and equipment (PPQE)  is the book value of the fixed assets-their cost minus accumulated depreciation. Total assets- are what the cooperative owns-current assets, plus investments, plus net fixed assets equal total assets. Current liabilities- are obligations the cooperative must pay within the next year. Accounts payable is money owed, usually to suppliers (sometimes classi- fied as accounts payable-trade accounts). Accrued expenses and accrued taxes are unpaid expenses. They often include unpaid salaries and benefits earned by employees. Accrued taxes often include property and sales taxes that have been incurred but not yet paid. Other liabilities in this study are most often accounts payable-grains and oilseeds  delivered and sold to the cooperative by its patrons who have not yet been paid. Retired equity represents allocated equity that the board has approved to revolve to members but not yet paid as of the closing date of the books. This equity accu- mulated from past sales to or purchases from patrons-usually revolved to members on a set sched- ule (often 7 or more years later). Patronage refunds and dividends are monies declared but not yet paid to mem- bers for current use of the cooperative and for invest- ing in preferred stock. Cooperatives are required to pay at least 20 per- cent of their refunds in cash, with the rest becoming allocated equity to be revolved to the members at a later date. The refunds are based on cents per product (weight or bushel) sold and/or on a percent of the dol- lars of farm supplies purchased. The refunds are deter- mined by the board of directors. Dividends paid on preferred stock ownership are based on a set percent return on the investment. Current portion of Zong-term debt and seasonal short-term debt are the final current lia- bilities. They are money owed (principal) for borrow-ing money and for leases. Long-term debt typically is used to finance long-term assets, while short-term debt is usually used for operating or seasonal loans. Long-term debt- includes notes, bonds, mortgages, and leases not due within the current year. Member equities- are member and patron invest- ments in the cooperative. The two main types are allo- cated and unallocated. Allocated equity is assigned to members in one of two forms. Each member has one share and one vote. The other form includes noncash allocated certificates which are member investments in the cooperative based on use. Allocated equity could be classified as stock if the cooperative was incorporated or certificates of owner- ship if not incorporated. In most cases, cooperative stock or ownership certificates are not generally traded between members and, if sold, require board approval. Unallocated equity is the retained earnings of the cooper- ative and often thought of as nonmember-nonpatron- age business but can also be based on member business. Analysis of the Balance Sheet The balance sheet of a local cooperative states its financial position at the end of an operating period-a 1Zmonth  fiscal year. The balance sheet represents the cooperative’s assets, liabilities, member equity, and their relationship to each other. This report analyzes the balance sheets of 432 local cooperatives to provide examples of typical levels for assets, liabilities, and member equities for different sizes and types. Table 5 compares common size balance sheets for all respondents for 1995 and 1994. Appendix tables l-4 show common size balance sheets by size and type for 1995. In a common size balance sheet, each account is listed as a percentage of total assets. The dollar amount of total assets the balance sheets represent is listed at the bottom of the table. By cooperative size, total assets increased from $1.5 million for small coop- eratives to $16.2 million for super-size cooperatives (table 7). By cooperative type, total assets were $2.7 million for farm supply, $6.2 million for mixed farm supply, $7.8 million for mixed marketing, and $9 mil- lion for marketing (table 8). Current Assets Looking first at current assets, cash and cash equivalents as a percent of total assets decreased as cooperative size increased. For small cooperatives,cash was 7.4 percent of total assets. But, this dropped to From 1994 to 1995, current assets increased by 24 1.9 percent for super cooperatives. Farm supply cooper- percent.

By size, farm supply invento- ries increased about 10 percent more for large and super cooperatives and by type, about 5 percent more for both farm supply cooperatives. Grains and oilseeds inventories increased more than 55 percent for medi- um and super cooperatives. By type, they increased more than 50 percent for all but farm supply coopera- tives. There were also regional differences in inventory buildup. By looking at 103 cooperatives that had their grains and oilseeds  inventories increase more than 50 percent, 65 cooperatives were in Iowa, Minnesota, or Nebraska. In dollar terms, inventory increased $178 million, with $128 million in these three States. Part of this buildup was due to low grains and oilseeds  prices the prior year and farmers holding back sales. But a grain railcar  shortage in the upper Midwest also forced some cooperatives to resort to outdoor storage on the ground (with increased grain prices and especially corn prices, inventories of grains and oilseeds  can be expected to be much lower in FY 96). Interest expenses in the three States increased by $7 million, in part to finance these inventories. Local sav- ings fell $10 million and 30 cooperatives had losses in local income. Net income was up 16 percent for these cooperatives due to patronage refunds, so that only nine experienced losses. Accounts receivable in this study were farm sup- ply trade accounts, not grains and oilseeds  trade receivables. Farm supply and grains and oilseeds  trade receivables (“other” current assets) were separated to allow ratio analysis in a future section of this study. Accounts receivable for farm supply sales increased 7 percent, growing at about the same rate as the increase in farm supply sales. The age of accounts receivable refers to how long ago the sale that started this receivable was made. Most cooperatives have credit sales with discounts offered to promote prompt payment. Terms might be 2 percent-10 days, net 30 days (no discount). Discounts might be offered on all farm supply sales or on certain products. The terms and what products had discounts were not known, but 96 cooperatives listed their dis- count on sales, and it was 1.22 percent on total farm supply sales. The age of accounts receivable is known for 54 cooperatives for both years (table 6). Fifty-five percent were current. Another 14 percent were from 31 to 60 days old. The largest difference between the 2 years was nearly 12 percent of receivables were more than 6 months old compared with 8 percent in 1994.Table 6 Age of SCCOUM  receivable, 1995 and 1994 Accounts receivable age 1995 1994 Percent Current, 0 to 30 days 55.02 53.15 31 to 60 days 14.26 14.77 61 to 90 days 8.69 10.55 91 to 120 days 1.96 4.70 121 to 180 days 3.10 3.72 Greater than 6 months 11.63 7.70 Accounts written off this period 5.34 5.41 Based on accounts receivable of: $26,284,134  $24,160,885 Investments and Other Assets About 1.4 percent of cooperative’s total assets was invested in the Bank for Cooperatives or CoBank. Larger cooperatives and both types of marketing coop- eratives had comparable investments. Meanwhile, investments in other cooperatives dropped from a high of 26 percent for small cooperatives to 13 percent for super cooperatives. Across types, marketing coopera- tives had less invested than farm supply cooperatives. Other assets often included overdue accounts receiv- able and were generally less than 2 percent of total assets for all cooperative sizes and types (except large farm supply cooperatives, 4.2 percent). Property, Plant, and Equipment Net property, plant, and equipment (PP&E)  as a percent of total assets tended to be between 22 percent and 26 percent for all cooperative sizes. Net PP&E increased 6.5 percent from 1994. Cooperatives that handled grains and oilseeds  had higher dollar amounts of PP&E,  probably due to extensive grains and oilseeds  storage and handling facilities and, also, because these cooperatives were larger than farm sup- ply cooperatives. But, both farm supply cooperatives had growth in net W&E  of at least 9 percent while both marketing cooperatives were less than 5.5 per- cent. Current Liabilities Current liabilities grew 33 percent between 1994 and 1995. The largest increase was in notes payable- seasonal used to finance current operations, and usual- ly used for inventories, They grew from 11.2 percent of total assets to 16.5 percent. Farm supply cooperatives had a negligible change while mixed farm supply, mixed marketing, and marketing cooperatives all were up 5 percent.Table 7%Common  size balance sheets by cooperative size, 1995 Small Medium Large Super Assets Current assets Cash and cash equivalents Accounts receivable Inventories-grains and oilseeds -farm supplies Prepaid expenses Other current assets7.41 13.10 3.29 20.23 2.15 3.93Percent of fofal assets 4.59 3.03 14.05 11.96 11.38 18.46 14.11 12.68 64 63 5.07 6.541.93 9.07 31.21 9.15 .77 9.21 Total current assets Investments and other assets Investments-other cooperatives --Bank for Cooperatives50.11 50.04 53.50 61.34 26.20 22.51 17.95 12.72 .37 1.39 1.41 1.65 -total 26.57 23.90 19.36 14.37 Other assets 1.15 1.40 1.50 .53 Total investments & other assets Property, plant, and equipment At cost Less accumulated depreciation27.72 25.30 20.86 14.90 60.87 67.77 71.20 60.07 38.70 43.11 45.57 36.30 Net PP&E 22.17 24.66 25.64 23.76 Total assets 100.00 100.00 100.00 100.00 Liabilities and owner equities Current liabilities Current portion of long-term debt Notes payable-seasonal Accounts payable Patrons credii balances & other liabilities Accrued taxes Accrued expenses Patronage refunds (cash) Total current liabilities Long-term debt Total liabilities 27.86 37.73 47.11 58.76 Owner equities Allocated equity Unallocated equity1.76 3.05 4.11 3.12 6.35 9.29 13.09 22.19 6.38 5.88 6.09 4.35 6.19 9.13 12.94 18.74 .44 .55 .65 .71 1.30 1.42 1.65 1.52 1.31 1.38 1.31 1.10 23.73 30.70 39.84 51.73 4.13 7.03 7.27 7.03 53.64 45.70 39.58 30.02 18.50 16.57 13.31 11.22 Total owner equities 72.14 62.27 52.89 41.24 Total liabilities and owner equities Based on total assets of:100.00 100.00 100.00 100.00 $1,460,910 $3,558,985 $8,316,485 $16,249,985 7Table s-Common  Size balance sheets by cooperative type, 1995 Farm supply Mixed farm supply Mixed marketing Marketing Assets Current assets Cash and cash equivalents Accounts receivable Inventories-grains and oifseeds -farm supplies Prepaid expenses Other current assets Total current assetsPercent of total assets 5.34 2.78 2.66 2.30 13.59 15.15 10.41 7.09 0.00 16.32 27.53 35.66 23.11 12.33 9.79 6.16 2.05 .65 .68 .57 2.69 3.85 8.64 11.51 46.78 51.08 59.71 63.29 Investments and other assets Investments-other cooperatives -Bank for Cooperatives25.47 19.77 14.66 11.30 .72 1.39 1.67 1.69 -total 26.19 21.16 16.33 12.99 Other assets 2.12 1.31 .36 .63 Total investments & other assets Property, plant, and equipment At cost Less accumulated depreciation Net PP&E28.31 22.47 16.69 13.62 58.84 68.75 69.64 58.78 33.93 42.30 46.04 35.69 24.91 26.45 23.60 23.09 Total assets 100.00 100.00 100.00 100.00 Liabilities and owner equities Current liabilities Current portion of long-term debt Notes payable-seasonal Accounts payable Patrons credit balances & other liabilities Accrued taxes Accrued expenses Patronage refunds (cash)2.00 3.14 3.36 4.00 6.79 15.67 18.91 20.90 7.66 6.34 4.35 3.78 5.27 7.06 16.47 23.78 .51 .55 .76 .67 1.86 1.88 1.54 1.03 1.62 1.51 1.23 0.74 Total current liabilities Long-term debt Total liabilities Owner equities Allocated equity Unallocated equity Total owner equities Total liabilities and owner equities Based on assets of:25.71 36.15 46.62 54.90 7.42 7.81 5.97 6.77 33.13 43.96 52.59 61.67 52.05 45.05 32.67 26.52 14.82 10.99 14.74 11.81 66.87 56.04 47.41 38.33 100.00 100.00 100.00 100.00 $2,731,412 $6,180,969 $7,762,383 $9,046,959 8Patrons’ credit balances and other liabilities grew by 32 percent, mostly due to the inclusion of payables due on grains and oilseeds  trading and other market- ing activities. Accrued expenses and patronage refunds were the only other current liabilities that grew in double digits. Accrued expenses grew by 17.7 percent and were a slightly larger percentage of total assets for larger cooperatives and for both types of farm supply cooperatives. Cash patronage refunds and dividends grew by 15.5 percent, but was less than 2 percent of total assets for all sizes and types of cooperatives. Long-term Debt Long-term debt increased by 16.3 percent from 1994 to 1995. As a percent of total assets it generally increased with cooperative size, but interestingly, tended to be higher for both types of farm supply cooperatives. By type as a percent of total assets, long- term debt ranged from 6 percent to 7.8 percent with the farm supply cooperatives at the high end, about a percentage point higher than the marketing coopera- tives. Twenty-nine percent of the cooperatives had no long-term debt. About half were small farm supply cooperatives and combined together, farm supply cooperatives made up more than half. Nearly 66 percent of the cooperatives provided information that broke out four main sources of their $500 million total debt (short- and long-term com- bined)-Bank  for Cooperatives and CoBank,  commer- cial banks, debentures or notes, and other. A regional cooperative was most often the source in the “other” category. The local cooperative often purchases its farm supplies and markets its grains and oilseeds  through a regional cooperative, which becomes a source of debt capital. The debt may be short-term operating capital or long-term investment capital. Bank for Cooperatives and CoBank were the most frequent source of debt capital (59 percent). Others were regional cooperatives (32 percent), deben- tures or notes (5 percent), and commercial banks (4 percent). Most sources, except debentures and notes, extend lines of credit. Only 90 cooperatives reported their lines of credit for both years, but in total it increased by $20 million to $308 million in 1995. Of this line of credit, the unused portion fell by $20 mil- lion to $166 million in 1995. Member Equities Member equities to total assets represent the per- cent of the cooperative’s assets owned by the mem-bers, with creditors claiming the rest. Over all sizes and types of cooperatives, members averaged 50.3 per- cent ownership of the cooperative, down from 55.7 percent in 1994. Members of small cooperatives had the highest percentage of ownership (72.1 percent) while members of super-size cooperatives had the lowest (41.2 per- cent). By cooperative type, members of mixed farm supply cooperatives owned at least 56 percent of their cooperatives’ assets while farm supply cooperatives’ members owned more than 66 percent. Both types of marketing cooperatives had lower member owner- ship-38.3 percent for marketing and 47.4 percent for mixed marketing cooperatives. Member equities consisted of both allocated (pre- ferred, common, and other kinds of ownership certifi- cates) and unallocated equity. Allocated equity as a percentage of total assets was highest for small cooper- atives at 53.6 percent and more than 45 percent for both farm supply cooperatives. Unallocated equity averaged more than 13 per- cent of total assets for all sizes and types, but fell as cooperative size increased. By type, unallocated equity was around 15 percent of total assets for farm supply and mixed marketing cooperatives and around 11 per- cent to 12 percent for mixed farm supply and market- ing cooperatives. Description of Income Statement The income statement shows the results of opera- tions for the past year and usually includes both the current and prior year. It lists all sources of revenue and expenses. The statement measures the profitability of the cooperative for a given period of time. Although it does not show timing of cash-flows, the statement best describes the status of the business. In the analysis of income statements, net sales were set at 100 percent to find out the proportion that a single item represented in a total group or subgroup. Because the income statement variables were expressed as a percent of net sales, comparisons were possible between different sizes and types of opera- tions. Thus, the statement used in this report became known as a “common size” income statement. This statement was provided for the average cooperative respondent in table 9. The first item listed on the income statement net sales was the primary source of revenue-farm supplies sold and products marketed. Cost of goods sold (COGS) was the amount a cooperative paid for the products it sold and market- 9Table 9-hICOI?W  Statt?t?Wnt  and change in SCCOUntS,  19%  t0 1995 1995 1994 Percent change Net sales Cost of goods sold Gross margin Service and other income Gross revenue Operating expenses Employee: Salaries and wages Payroll taxes Employee insurance Pension expense Total Administrative: Professional services Office supplies (includes postage) Telephone, markets Meetings and travel Donations Dues and subscriptions Directors’ fees and expense Annual meetings expense Total General: Advertising and promotion Delivery (auto & truck) expense Insurance Property & Business taxes Other taxes and licenses Rent and lease expense Plant supplies & repairs Repairs and maintenance Utilities (includes dryer expense) Miscellaneous expenses Other expenses Total Depreciation Interest expense Bad debts Total expenses Local savings Patronage refunds received Savings before income taxes Less income taxes Net income Based on sales of:100.00 90.06 9.94 3.98 13.92Percent of net sales 100.00 89.87 10.13 3.79 13.927.82 8.05 5.83 13.26 7.85 4.69 4.36 15.97 .37 .36 9.31 .49 .50 6.78 .14 .14 12.94 5.69 5.36 7.16 .16 .13 34.45 .16 .16 7.72 .09 .09 7.18 .07 .07 7.52 .Ol .Ol 9.92 .03 .03 15.51 .03 .03 6.26 .02 .02 3.93 57 .54 13.66 .16 .16 8.81 .68 .63 16.27 .49 .51 2.83 .33 .34 3.55 .15 .17 (4.96) .20 .20 9.28 .22 .20 21.74 .68 .65 12.85 .49 .51 3.08 .12 .ll 17.21 .32 .39 (14.35) 3.84 3.87 18.00 1.53 1.54 7.33 .89 .68 42.42 .ll .lO 17.16 12.63 12.09 12.65 1.29 1.83 (23.98) 1.41 1.11 36.55 2.70 2.94 (1.03) .31 .68 (51 .Ol) 2.39 2.26 14.01 $12,187,025 $11,302,965 10ed-cost to the cooperative for the supplies sold and payments to farmers for products marketed. Net sales less COGS represented the gross margin on sales. Service and other income came mainly from pro- viding services to cooperative patrons. Service includ- ed delivery, chemical and fertilizer application, grain drying, and storage. Although substantial for some cooperatives, service income was not considered a pri- mary source of revenue. Operating expenses were those incurred in the course of conducting normal business. They were usu- ally classified by function like employee, administra- tive, general, and depreciation, interest, and bad debts. Local savings resulted from operations before taxes and patronage refunds from other cooperatives. Patronage refunds were based on volume of business conducted with another cooperative and were depen- dent on the other cooperative’s net income. Usually, this income was allocated equity and not actual cash coming into the respondent cooperatives. Net income was the end result of operations for that year. Distribution of net income was not part of the income statement. The board of directors decides how to distribute net income or allocate a net loss. Analysis of the Income Statement The income statement displays the net results of cooperative operations. Because most managers’ per- formance is judged by net income, members attach great importance to the income statement. In the fol- lowing sections, the underling values of the income statement are studied. Table 9 presents a common size income statement for 432 cooperatives and the change between 1994 and 1995. Appendix tables 5 to 8 show common size income statements by size and type for 1995. Net Sales The first item of the income statement analyzed in this report was net sales. It was determined by sub- tracting sales discounts and returns and allowances from gross sales. The average net sales for the 432 cooperatives in 1995 was $12.2 million, up $0.9 million or 7.8 percent from 1994. Net sales by cooperative size are presented in table 10, and by type in table 11. All sizes and types of cooperatives experienced a growth in net sales from 1994. If assets from tables 7 and 8 are compared to net sales in tables 10 and 11, sales for all types (except marketing) and sizes are about twice the level of assets.Cost of Goods Sold Cost of goods sold (COGS) represented the largest single component of expenses, usually expressed as a percent of net sales. For this study, COGS includes the beginning inventory plus purchas- es and freight costs, minus purchase returns and allowances, purchase discounts, and ending inventory. So, for these cooperatives, COGS was the purchase price of the farm supplies sold or products marketed. Table 11 shows COGS as a percent of net sales for the different types of cooperatives. Both types of market- ing cooperatives had a relatively high COGS when compared with farm supply cooperatives, which was to be expected because they were generally marketing grains and oilseeds  for their patrons with only a few cents per bushel margin. There was negligible change in COGS by cooperative size and type between the 2 years. Gross Margins Gross margins were the excess of net sales over the cost of goods sold. The gross margin averaged 9.9 percent for all cooperatives, down from 10.1 percent in 1994. The gross margin or gross margin percentage is a very important operating ratio. A small change in the gross margin has a tremendous impact on local sav- ings. A cooperative manager must maintain a gross margin near industry averages. Thus, least cost sources of supplies need to be developed and marketing coop- eratives must pay market rates on the products they purchase. Cooperatives are often characterized as business- es that provide goods and services “at cost.” However, a cooperative cannot operate at cost on a day-to-day basis. Therefore, unless a cooperative has an adequate gross margin, it can neither be profitable nor afford to finance essential future-directed discretionary expen- ditures such as expansion and advertising. Because by definition, gross margin equals net sales less cost of goods sold, those cooperatives with higher COGS had lower gross margins. COGS were higher for marketing and larger cooperatives, so gross margins as a percent of net sales were highest for farm supply and small cooperatives. Farm supply coopera- tives-16.7 percent-had the highest gross margin. Although both types of farm supply cooperatives had less business volume than those that performed mar- keting activities, their gross margin percentage was from 6 to 10 percentage points higher. Small coopera- tives, mostly selling farm supplies, had the highest gross margin by size (15.6 percent). 11Table w-Abbreviated income statement as a percent of net sales for cooperatives by size, 1995 Small Medium Large Super Percent of net sa/es Net sales 100.00 100.00 100.00 100.00 Cost of goods sold 64.36 67.66 89.08 91.98 Gross margin 15.64 12.34 10.92 a.02 Service and other income 3.63 4.16 4.07 3.94 Gross revenue 19.27 16.50 14.99 11.96 Expenses Employee 1 9.23 7.22 6.52 4.58 Administrative * 1.10 .79 .59 -44 General 3 4.35 3.78 3.56 3.35 Depreciation 2.11 1.97 1.74 1.46 Interest .68 .a2 .90 1.03 Bad debts .23 .24 .ia .06 Totalexpenses 17.70 14.82 13.49 10.92 Local savings 1.57 1.68 1.50 1.04 Patronage refunds received 2.36 1 .a4 1.49 1.12 Savings before income taxes 3.93 3.52 2.99 2.16 Less income taxes .24 .42 .49 .20 Net income 3.69 3.10 2.50 1.96 Based on total sales of: $2,599,834 $7,010,685 $13,819,360 !§37,104,303 t Employee expenses include salaries and wages, payroll taxes, employee insurance, unemployment compensation, and pension expense. 2 Administrative costs include professional services, office supplies, telephone, meetings and travel, donations, dues and subscriptions, directors’ fees and expense, and annual meetings. 3 General expenses include advertising and promotion, delivery (auto and truck), insurance, property, business and other taxes and licenses, rent and lease expenses, plant supplies and repairs, repairs and maintenance, utilities, miscellaneous, and other. Gross margins vary not only by cooperative, but also by farm supply sold or product marketed. Cooperatives, like other businesses, have different margins for different products. For 100 cooperatives that provided their individual product gross margins, these margins are shown in table 12. Margins vary due to product type and competition. For instance, fertiliz- er sold by the truckload has a different margin than a sale of a single bag. The services offered in conjunction with a sale (e.g., fertilizer spread on the field by a cooperative truck) have an impact on margin. Margins are also subject to competition. The gross margin dis- cussed in the first paragraph of this section is a blend- 12ed margin, made up of the margins of all products the cooperative sold, services rendered, and products mar- keted. The highest weighted (by volume) gross margin for the five main farm supplies was for fertilizer with a gross margin of almost 19 percent. The maximum mar- gin on fertilizer of 46 percent was for a small amount, probably a speciality fertilizer sold by the bag. Feed and petroleum margins were both around 17 percent. The margin of -302 percent on seed looks incorrect and needs further explanation. This margin was from a cooperative with more than $6 million in grains and oilseeds  sales that sold $1,500 of seed for $400.

For example, the two cooperatives with the lowest margins were located in close proximity and of course, in head-to-head competition. On further analysis, both cooperatives have been profitable over the past 5 years and have increased sales. They have even discussed merger, but membership has resisted this change. In this one instance, their low margins may be equated to low product prices-something that their members have noted by increasing their purchases from both cooperatives.Grains and oilseeds  were the only products mar- keted where gross margins were known. Grains and oilseeds  margins were low, only around 4 percent. Around 10 cooperatives reported high grains and oilseeds  margins of 18 and 19 percent. These high mar- gins were all at mixed farm supply cooperatives that had feed sales. It is suspected that the high margins resulted from the grain and oilseed  content in livestock feeds sold rather than the commodities themselves. Service and Other Income Service and other income, for the most part, con- sisted of trucking services (both delivery of purchases to patrons and transfer of their products to market), custom application of fertilizers and crop protectants, and drying and storing of grains and oilseeds.

This income averaged between 3.6 percent and 5 percent of net sales for all sizes and types of cooperatives. Other income was derived from non-operating sources such as interest and finance charges. This income included interest on cash equivalents and interest charged on credit sales. Other income also came from the sale of property, plant, and equipment, rentals, and extraordinary items. Sometimes property, plant, and equipment was sold to generate income, but usually it was the sale of a fully depreciated asset where the market value was greater than the book value. In some cases, disposal of a fully depreciated asset may mean a loss to the coop- erative. Rental income from unused facilities or equip- ment provided income flows. Extraordinary items might be either a gain or a loss. A gain could result from a fire loss where the insurance settlement was greater than the book value of the asset. A loss might be from flood damage for which the cooperative had no coverage. Operating Expenses Operating expenses were divided into four main categories-employee; administrative; general; and depreciation, interest, and bad debts. Employee expenses, of course, were related to labor costs. Administrative expenses included a variety of over- head costs associated with a cooperative and indirectly related to revenue production. General expenses were those directly related to revenue production, The bulk were in employee, general, and depreciation categories. 14Employee Expenses Employee expenses included salaries, wages, and benefits (payroll taxes, employee insurance, unem- ployment compensation, and pension expense) and averaged 5.7 percent of net sales for all respondent cooperatives. Employee expenses, up 7.2 percent from 1994, represented the smallest increase of all the major expense categories. As a percent of net sales, employee expenses decreased as cooperative size increased. This expense decreased from 9.2 percent of net sales for small coop- eratives to 4.6 percent for super cooperatives. By type, employee expenses as a percent of net sales were 9.6 percent for farm supply cooperatives and 3.4 percent for marketing cooperatives. About 62 percent of the cooperatives (268) pro- vided employee numbers and expenses (table 13). These expenses were for all employees. To equate part- time to full-time employees for purposes of this study, four part-time employees were considered as one full- time equivalent employee.3 Based on that calculation, the expense for a single employee averaged $30,119 for an average 19 employees, up 4 percent from 1994. By size, they ranged from $26,982 for small to $33,010 for super cooperatives and by type from $27,611 for those selling only farm supplies to $33,481 for mixed market- ing cooperatives. Small cooperatives averaged 8 actual full-time employees (excludes part-time), medium, 16; 3 Based on previous research conducted by CS economist David E.

Farm supply cooperatives averaged 14 employees, mixed farm supply, 28; mixed marketing, 25; and marketing, 19. Cooperatives with a significant proportion of their sales as farm supplies tended to be more labor intensive. Operating a feed mill or service station, applying chemicals and fertilizers, and selling hard- ware required the use of several employees. For instance, a small farm supply cooperative had 9 full- time employees while a small marketing cooperative used fewer employees-often only a manager, book- keeper, and two others. Administrative Expenses Administrative expenses were indirectly related to generating income. Managers usually had more con- trol over administrative expenses than any other cost. In years when revenues were down, managers could reduce expenses in this area more easily than in other categories. Administrative costs include professional services, donations, dues and subscriptions, directors’ fees and expenses, annual meetings, meetings and travel, office supplies, and telephone and market infor- mation.Professional services (such as legal, accounting, and computer) and office supplies both comprised 0.16 percent of net sales-the largest administrative expense. In total, administrative expenses were less than 0.6 percent of net sales. These expenses fell from a high of 1.1 percent for small cooperatives to 0.44 per- cent for super cooperatives. As cooperative size increased, the highest administrative expense, profes- sional services, fell as the cooperative relied more on its own employees to perform these tasks rather than purchase the services. Although directors’ fees and expenses were a small part of total costs, director compensation was important to many cooperatives to get farmers to sacri- fice time normally spent on their own operations to devote several hours of service each month to guiding their cooperative. Table 14 shows the number of direc- tors and their compensation for 282 cooperatives in 1995. Board expenses seemed rather modest, averaging $684  per director. The average board had seven direc- tors. By size, small cooperatives paid directors the least ($364) and super paid the most ($1,306). By type, mixed farm supply cooperatives paid the most at $1,087 per director. 15General Expenses General expenses were usually fixed in the short run and associated with income production. These expenses included advertising and promotion, deliv- ery (auto and truck), general insurance, property, busi- ness and other taxes and licenses, rent and lease expenses, plant supplies and repairs, repairs and main- tenance, utilities (including dryer expenses), miscella- neous, and other. Most of these expenses (with the exception of advertising and promotion) were not under direct management control. General expenses averaged 3.8 percent of net sales in 1995, Repairs and maintenance and delivery expenses at 0.68 percent of net sales were the largest in the general category, followed by insurance and utili- ties, both at 0.49. By cooperative size, general expenses were 4.4 for small cooperatives and 3.4 for super coop- eratives. By cooperative type, these expenses were around 5 percent of net sales for farm supply coopera- tives and around 3 for marketing cooperatives. Depreciation, Interest, and Bad Debts Depreciation expense averaged 1.5 percent of net sales; interest, 0.9 percent; and bad debts, 0.1 percent. By cooperative size, depreciation expense as a percent of net sales was 2.1 percent for small cooperatives and 1.5 percent for super cooperatives. By cooperative type, depreciation expense was 2.2 percent of net sales for farm supply cooperatives, 1.5 percent for mixed marketing, and 1.2 percent for marketing cooperatives. As discussed earlier, interest expenses, especially for short-term borrowing increased dramatically, going from 0.7 percent of net sales in 1994 to 0.9 percent in 1995. Interest expenses were lowest among small coop- eratives at 0.7, but grew to more than 1 percent for super cooperatives. By type, interest expenses were about 0.9 percent for all cooperatives except mixed farm supply which was highest at 1.1 percent.Bad debts as a percent of net sales fell as coopera- tive size increased-O.2 for small cooperatives and 0.1 for super cooperatives. By cooperative type, bad debts were 0.2 for both farm supply cooperatives and around 0.1 for both marketing cooperatives. Local Savings Local savings or local income was generated from own operations (before taxes and patronage refunds from other cooperatives). Local savings as a percent of net sales was highest for small cooperatives (1.6 per- cent) and lowest for super cooperatives (1 percent). By type, local savings was the highest for farm supply cooperatives (1.9 percent) and the lowest for market- ing cooperatives (0.8 percent). Small cooperatives, and especially farm supply cooperatives, had higher local savings than larger marketing cooperatives. About 24 percent of the cooperatives in this study had losses. While small cooperatives have higher returns on net sales, 50 or one-third of them lost money. Table 15 shows losses by size and type. Thirty percent of the mixed farm supply cooperatives lost money. Most likely to lose money were small mixed farm supply cooperatives (57 percent). Patronage Refunds Received Patronage refunds received or income from other cooperatives resulted from locals doing business with other cooperatives, generally regionals, or cooperative banks such as CoBank or the Bank for Cooperatives. The patronage refund from regionals was based on business volume and consisted of cash refunds and equity stock. The equity stock was usually revolved back to the local cooperative on a set schedule. Many respondent cooperatives also borrowed funds from CoBank and the Bank for Cooperatives and received both cash and noncash  patronage income.

Patronage refunds reflect the volume of business with regional cooperatives, CoBank or the Bank for Cooperatives. The dollar amount of patronage refunds between 1994 and 1995 was up 37 percent, suggesting 1995 must have been a good year for regional coopera- tives, CoBank, or the Bank for Cooperatives. Patronage refunds received were 2.4 percent of net sales for small cooperatives and 1.1 percent for super cooperatives. By cooperative type, patronage refunds received as a per- cent of net sales were higher for farm supply coopera- tives than for marketing cooperatives. Patronage refunds were an important source of revenues. They allowed 71 (out of 102) cooperatives that had local losses to have net income. Income Taxes Cooperatives paid income taxes on earnings not allocated to members (retained earnings) and on divi- dend payments. The decision as to what amounts of income that were allocated to retained earnings and to members was made by the board of directors. The treatment of nonmember business has an impact on retained earnings because the cooperative could allo- cate the earnings to nonmembers or retain the income. In terms of net sales, income tax paid was 0.3 percent of net sales in 1995. Income tax paid by cooperatives varied by size and type. Small cooperatives paid income taxes equal to 0.2 percent of their net sales, medium, 0.4; large, 0.5; and super, 0.2. All cooperatives except mixed market- ing ( 0.5 percent) paid 0.2 percent of their net sales in income taxes. Net Income Net income is the term used here for profits on cooperative income statements.

For small cooperatives it was 3.7 percent of net sales, medium, 3.1 percent; large, 2.5 percent; and super, 2 percent. By cooperative type, farm supply had returns of 4.1 percent on net sales, mixed farm supply had 3.2 percent, mixed marketing cooperatives, 2.1 percent, and marketing cooperatives, 1.5 percent. Net income (before taxes) was generally distrib- uted five ways-non-cash patronage allocations, cash patronage refunds, retained earnings, income taxes, and dividends on patron’s equity (table 16). Nearly 53 percent of net income before taxes was held as non- cash patronage allocations by the 287 cooperatives that provided income allocations. Cash patronage refunds were 22 percent. All distributions of income were basi- cally unchanged from 1994. Only 9 of the 287 coopera- tives reported dividends on preferred stock. The effec- tive interest paid was 3.22 percent. Financial Ratio Analvsis Looking beyond levels of assets, liabilities, mem- ber equities, sales, and expenses, cooperative man- agers and boards of directors need comparative mea- sures to evaluate their cooperative’s financial performance. Standard ratios were used in this report, includ- ing financial ratio analysis that allow performance comparisons between years and different cooperatives. No single financial indicator will provide enough information to determine a cooperative’s financial health. Therefore, ratios must be carefully interpreted. It is important to look at a group of financial ratios over a period of time, evaluate other cooperatives with similar sales and functions, and/or compare perfor- mance with other cooperatives in the same geographi- cal area. Ratios used in this study were often chosen because of their comparability with prior studies. Therefore, most figures show ratios for the 11-year period for all 1,610 cooperatives. Data for 1994 and 1995 reflect information gathered from the same 432 cooperatives that reported for both years. Performance ratios measure various levels of cooperative operations and generally have both a financial and operational impact. Four categories were used-liquidity, leverage, activity, and profitability. Many factors underlie each ratio and examining one ratio may not help pinpoint problems. Net income before taxes: Number of cooperatives:$101,171,588  $94,112,032 287 330 17Liquidity Ratios Liquidity ratios, such as current and quick, mea- sure the cooperative’s ability to meet short-term oblig- ations. They focus on the cooperative’s ability to remain solvent. The current ratio is current assets divided by current liabilities. However, this ratio does not consider the degree of liquidity of each of the com- ponents of current assets. In other words, if the current assets of a cooperative were mainly cash, they would be much more liquid than if comprised of mainly inventory. If the ratio is less than 1, current liabilities exceed current assets and the cooperative’s liquidity is threat- Figure i-Current and Quick Ratios Ratio 21 4-=-Quick 0 ’IIIIIIIII 1985 868788899092939495ened.  Improvements in this ratio can be achieved by selling additional capital stock, borrowing additional long-term debt, or disposing of unproductive fixed assets and retaining proceeds. Current liabilities may also be reduced by retaining a greater portion of allo- cated savings (reducing the cash portion). A high current ratio is a favorable condition financially because it indicates the ability to pay cur- rent liabilities from the conversion of current assets into cash. Operationally, this same high ratio tends to increase operating freedom and reduce the probability of bill-paying difficulty from writedowns of accounts receivable or inventory. Figure 1 shows the current and quick ratios for the surveyed cooperatives. The current ratio was relatively constant for 3 years before it took a slight downturn in 1995. The total current assets increased 24 percent while total current liabilities increased 33 percent. From 1994 to 1995, grains and oilseeds  and farm sup- ply inventories and dividends on equity were the only elements of current liabilities that grew. Higher grain and oilseed  inventories are probably causing the 32- percent increase in patron credit balances and other liabilities (which contains grain trade payables). The current ratio fell as cooperative size increased. The ratio was highest for small cooperatives (2.11) and fell to 1.19 for super cooperatives (table 17). By cooper- ative type, the ratio was 1.15 for marketing coopera- tives and 1.82 for farm supply cooperatives (table 18). Quick ratio is current assets minus inventories, divided by current liabilities. Inventories are exclud- ed-the least liquid of all current assets. All elements of this ratio have increased.

Operationally, the results are the same as with current ratio. The quick ratio mimicked the movement of the current ratio. Small cooperatives (1.12) had the highest ratio and it decreased as size increased to 0.41 for super cooperatives (table 17). The quick ratio ranged from a low of 0.39 for marketing cooperatives to a high of 0.92 for farm supply cooperatives. This ratio was highest in 1986 and lowest in 1995 (figure 1).

They help to analyze the use of debt and the ability to meet obligations in times of crisis. Debt-to-asset ratio is defined as total debt divided by total assets. Elements of this ratio include long-term debt plus short-term debt and total assets. Long-term debt increased at the same rate as total assets, which may indicate some short-term obligations were being carried and converted to long-term debt. With invento- ries increasing in the short term, quick financing is needed, usually through the use of short-term debt. In fact, short-term debt increased 72 percent between 1994 and 1995 (table 5). Lenders would rather see a low ratio indicating the cooperative’s ability to repay the loan. Overall, this ratio increased from .21 to .27 because assets increased by 17 percent while debt increased by almost one-half (figure 2). Reducing debt, increasing savings, or financing a greater portion of assets with working capital may improve this ratio. Larger cooperatives were financing more of their assets with debt, but the highest ratio for any size or type of cooperative was still only 0.32 (table 17). Small cooperatives had the lowest use of debt at 0.12. Debt usage was highest for marketing cooperatives at 0.32. This was twice the ratio for farm supply cooperatives. By type, farm supply cooperatives had the lowest use of debt. Debt-to-equity ratio is calculated by dividing long- term debt by member equity. This ratio shows the financial flexibility and the long-term capital structure of the cooperative. High ratios indicate inadequate borrowing power of the cooperative.

A low ratio is more favorable and finan- cially impacts the cooperative through independence on outside sources of funds relative to owners’ equity. A low ratio may also have an unfavorable impact indi- cating low return on equity. Operationally, a low ratio tends to reduce interest cost. Improvement may be gained by reducing long-term debt by disposing of unproductive assets and using proceeds to liquidate debt, or accelerating payments on long-term loans. Other ways include increasing local equity by generat- ing higher levels of local savings, slowing down equity retirement programs, selling additional capital stock, or retaining a greater portion of allocated savings. As cooperative size grew, so did their use of long- term debt. The ratio for small cooperatives was 0.06 Table w-Financial analysis ratios for all cooperatives, 1995and1994 Ratio 1995 1994 Current 1.32 1.41 Quick 0.52 0.65 Debts-to-assets 0.27 0.21 Debt-to-equity 0.14 0.12 Times-interest-earned 3.65 4.65 Total-asset-turnover 2.16 2.34 Fixed-asset-turnover 6.93 8.83 Gross profit margin 9.94 10.13 Return on total assets before interest &taxes 8.04 8.66 Return on allocated equity 13.96 12.65 Figure %--Debt-To-Equity Ratio Percent 0.35 0.30 0.25 1985 86 67 88 89 90 92 93 94 95 20and 0.17 for super cooperatives (table 17). Marketing cooperatives had, at 0.18, the highest ratio by type, while farm supply cooperatives were the lowest at 0.11. When looking at the trend, the ratio increased slightly each year from 1992 to 1995, but is much lower than prior years (figure 3). Times-interest-earned ratio  is the number of times interest expense is covered by earnings. It is calculated by dividing earnings before interest and taxes by inter- est expense. A ratio of one or more indicates the ability of current earnings to pay current interest expenses. Lending institutions are more apt to loan to coopera- tives whose times-interest-earned ratio is more than one (1) because it shows their ability to pay interest payments. Subsequently, a lending institution may lend funds at lower rates more readily for capital improvements. Times-interest-earned ratio was higher for respondent cooperatives in 1993 before starting a slight downward trend for the next 2 years (figure 4). This ratio may be improved by collecting old receiv- ables, improving inventory turnover, disposing of assets and reducing debt with proceeds, or reducing debt with working capital. Financially, a high ratio impacts the return on equity and tends to increase it. Over time operationally, a high ratio will reduce inter- est cost. Interest coverage was the greatest for smaller cooperatives and generally fell as cooperative size increased to super cooperatives (table 17). By coopera- tive type, the ratio ranged from 2.81 for marketing to 6.04 for farm supply. Figure 4-Times-interest-Earned  Ratio Ratio ” 1985 86 87 88 89 90 92 93 94 95Activity Ratios Activity ratios measure how well cooperatives use assets. A low ratio could mean that the cooperative was overcapitalized or carrying too much inventory. A high ratio could be deceptive. A cooperative with fully depreciated older assets could have an artificially high ratio even though those assets were no longer operat- ing efficiently. Total-asset-turnover ratio was found by dividing net sales by total cooperative assets. This ratio has gone down slightly from 2.34 in 1994 to 2.16 in 1995 (figure 5). Both elements of this ratio increased-total sales by 8 percent and total assets by 17 percent. A high ratio exerts a favorable financial influence through the reduction of financial leverage and/or increased return on equity. A high ratio operationally tends to reduce interest costs. The ratio was higher for larger cooperatives (table 17). Super cooperatives had the highest ratio at 2.28, indicating the most efficient use of assets. By cooperative type, the total asset turnover ratio was higher for marketing than farm supply. The total asset turnover ratio was lowest in 1995 at 2.16 and highest in 1989 at 3.01. Fixed-asset-turnover ratio represents net sales divided by net property, plant, and equipment (PP&E). This ratio is similar to the total asset turnover ratio and shows how well the cooperative is using its fixed assets. This ratio by itself might not give a complete picture of the cooperative’s financial health. A cooper- ative with fully depreciated assets would have an arti- Figure ti--Total-  and Fixed-Asset-Turnover Ra tie 12 1 10 “I6 Total-asset-turnover 4 2-0’ ’I I 1 I I I I I I 1985a6a788a99092939495ficially  high ratio. A cooperative that invested heavily in PP&E  for future expansion will have a temporarily low ratio. After a high in 1989 of 10.20, this ratio has remained relatively level for the 1990s. In 1995, the ratio was 8.93 and increased slightly from 1994 because sales increased 8 percent while investment in fixed assets increased 7 percent. The measure for this ratio may or may not show favorable or unfavorable conditions. It simply reflects cooperative conditions. An abnormally high ratio usually indicates very old, nearly depreciated fixed assets or the leasing of prop- erty and equipment. A high ratio financially exerts a favorable influ- ence by increasing asset use, reducing financial lever- age, and/or increasing return on equity. A high ratio, operationally, tends to reduce depreciation and interest costs. It may also increase costs related to operating leases, personnel and travel or delivery expenses. This ratio may be improved by restricting further invest- ments in fixed assets; redesigning production, or office facilities to increase the sales generating potential of existing space and equipment; and/or selling idle machinery and parts, unused vehicles, and unneces- sary equipment. By size, a fixed-asset-turnover ratio of 9.61 was greatest for super cooperatives. By type, the ratio was the highest (10.49) for marketing cooperatives. The fixed-asset-turnover ratio was at its lowest in 1987 (fig- ure 51. Profitability Ratios Profitability ratios, such as gross profit margin, indicate the efficiency of the cooperative’s operations. Because a cooperative is owned by its user-members, many common industry profitability ratios have little meaning. For instance, profitability ratios measuring the return on common or preferred stock of similar investor-oriented firms are not appropriate because there is seldom an open market for cooperative stock. Gross profit margin is found by subtracting the cost of goods sold from, net sales and then dividing this amount (gross margin) by net sales. The gross profit margin is an important operating ratio. A small change in the gross margin has a tremendous impact on local savings. It indicates the cooperative’s pricing policy and cost of goods offered for sale. For all cooperatives, the gross profit margin aver- aged 9.94 percent in 1995. The gross profit margin was the highest for respondent cooperatives in 1993 at 10.76 percent (figure 6). By size, gross profit margin diminished as cooperative sales grew. At 15.64 percent, 21small cooperatives had the highest gross margin. By type, farm supply and mixed farm supply coopera- tives, at 16.68 percent and 14.94 percent, had the high- est margins in 1995 (table 18). Return on total assets measures the rate of return on total investment. It is calculated by dividing net income by total assets and usually calculated before interest and taxes. This ratio is a measure of perfor- mance. It is not sensitive to the leverage position of the cooperative. Although some assets were financed through debt, the ratio measures return to both mem- bers and lenders. This ratio declined by 0.62 percent to 8.04 percent between 1994 and 1995 (table 19). Net savings (before income taxes) declined 1 per- cent while interest expense increased 42 percent dur- ing the 2-year period (table 9). For the decade, this ratio was highest in 1992 and 1995 and has been fairly constant (figure 7). Operationally, a high ratio tends to reduce interest cost and financially indicates a compar- atively high rate of return on assets employed. Medium and large cooperatives had a higher return on total assets (table 17). Medium-sized cooper- atives were slightly higher at 8.54 percent. By coopera- tive type, return on total assets was highest for farm supply cooperatives at 9.27 percent. Assets relative to revenue were higher for both types of farm supply cooperatives. Return on allocated equity is net income divided by allocated equity. It was determined by subtracting unallocated equity from total member equities. It rep- resents member investment in their cooperative and is an important measure of profitability. Figure 6- Gross Profit Margin Percent ‘*tiThis ratio increased 1 percent in 1995 (table 19). This ratio is sensitive to the amount of debt capital in the cooperative and best used in conjunction with other measures such as the return on total assets. Net savings increased 14 percent while allocated equity increased 3 percent from 1994 to 1995. Financially, a high ratio is favorable and tends to decrease financial leverage. However, a high ratio may also be a symptom of low investment adequacy. Operationally, a high ratio tends to reduce interest cost over time but may occur when both total debt and interest costs are on the high side. By size, this ratio increased as the cooperative grew in size. Super cooperatives had the highest return on allocated equity (14.92 percent). Farm supply and mixed farm supply cooperatives ratios were 14.06 per- cent and 13.35 percent and marketing and mixed mar- keting cooperatives were 13.51 percent and 14.65 per- cent (table 18). Summary and Conclusions Local cooperatives studied in this report general- ly had strong financial statements. Assets increased 17 percent from 1994 to 1995. More than half of the accounts receivable were less than 30 days old. Investment in W&E  grew 7 percent. Owner equities grew 5 percent and member ownership in the local exceeds 50 percent. Net sales grew 8 percent. Total expenses grew 13 percent while net income grew slightly faster, at 14 percent.

They are also important to rural communities, often one of the largest employers, and provide considerable tax revenues. The extensive consolidation of local cooperatives during the past two decades reflects attempts to maintain an adequate size from which to provide their members with expanded products and markets. Despite consolidation, coopera- tives studied maintained an average of two branch locations from which to better serve members. These cooperatives maintained strong ties to regional cooperatives, CoBank  or the Bank for Cooperatives through which they obtained products, gained marketing opportunities, or borrowed needed capital. Investment in other cooperatives rose 8 percent from 1994. In turn, patronage refunds to local coopera- tives from regionals and the banks increased 37 per- cent and made the year profitable for 71 cooperatives that would have otherwise had losses. But, local coop- eratives cannot depend on large patronage refunds and with numerous locals losing money, further con- solidation of locals may be necessary in the future. An area of concern in the financial statements was the large buildup in inventories and subsequent increases in short-term debt. Grains and oilseeds inventories increased 51 percent; short-term debt climbed 72 percent and pushed up interest costs 42 percent. Inventory buildup and the subsequent growth in assets financed through additional debt had an impact on much of the ratio analysis: 1) Liquidity ratios, current and quick, declined slightly in 1995 due to increased grains and oilseeds  and farm supply inventories; 2) Leverage ratios-debt-to-total assets ratio, jumped from 0.21 in1994 to0.27 in1995 because assets increased 17 percent while debt increased almost 50 percent; 3) Activity ratios-total-asset-turnover ratio fell from 2.34 in 1994 to 2.16 in 1995 because total sales increased only 8 percent while assets increased 17 percent with much of the increase in inventories; and finallyBut increases in inventories are not expected to be a long-term trend. More current information sug- gests the inventory problem will be a non-issue in FY 1996. Prices for most grains and oilseeds  increased greatly this past year and most inventories were prob- ably liquidated to capture the higher prices. Other pressing issues are sure to arise in the coming year. Cooperatives are owned by their farmer/member/patrons. As long as those farmers want to own a business where they can purchase their supplies and market their products, cooperatives will continue to adapt to changing economic conditions.

Financial Statements of the General Department    PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, 655 New York Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20001   T: (202) 414 1000, www.pwc.com/us       Report of Independent Auditors     To the  Board of Governors of the International Monetary Fund     Opinion     We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the General Department of the International  Monetary Fund (the “Department”), which comprise the  statements of financial position as of April 30,  2022 and 2021, and the related statements of income, of comprehensive income, of changes in reserves,  retained earnings, and resources, and of cash flows for the years then ended , including the related notes  (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”).     In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial  position of the Department as of April 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash  flows for the years then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued  by the International Accounting Standards Board.     Basis for Opinion     We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of  America (US GAAS) and in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our  responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibil ities for the Audit  of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of the International  Monetary Fund, and have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant  ethical requirements relatin g to our audit,  which include relevant ethical requirements in the United  States of America and the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for  Professional Accountants . We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and  appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.     Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial  Statements     Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the fina ncial statements in  accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting  Standards Board, and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the  preparation and fair presenta tion of financial statements that are free from material misstatement,  whether due to fraud or error.     In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Department’s ability to  continue as a going concern for at least, but not limited to, twelve months from the end of the reporting  period , disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of  accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Department or to cease operati ons, or has  no realistic alternative but to do so.           Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Department’s financial reporting  process.     Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements       Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are  free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that  includes our opinion . Reasonable assurance is a high l evel of assurance but is not absolute assurance and  therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with US GAAS and ISAs  will always  detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement result ing  from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional  omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material  if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment  made by a reasonable user based on the financial statements.     In performing an audit in accordance with US GAAS and ISAs we:    ● Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.   ● Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to  fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such  procedures include exam ining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in  the financial statements.   ● Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit  procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for  the purpose of expressing an  opinion on the effectiveness of the Department’s internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is  expressed.    ● Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant  accounting estimate s made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the  financial statements.   ● Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate,  that raise substantial doubt about the Department’s ability to c ontinue as a going concern for a  reasonable period of time.     We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the  planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal contr ol-related  matters that we identified during the audit.    Supplemental Information     Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the financial statements taken as a  whole. The accompanying supplemental schedules appearing on pages 40 to 48 as of April 30, 2022 and  for the years ended April 30, 2022 and 2021 (collectively referred to as the “supplemental schedules”) are  presented for purposes of additional analysis and are not a required part of the financial statements. The  supplemental s chedules are the responsibility of management and were derived from and relate directly to  the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the financial statements. The information  has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the au dit of the financial statements and certain  additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying  accounting and other records used to prepare the financial statements or to the financial statements     themselv es and other additional procedures, in accordance with US GAAS. We also subjected the  information to the applicable procedures required by ISAs. In our opinion, the supplemental schedules are  fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the fina ncial statements taken as a whole.         June 24, 2022       I.

Nature of operations  The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is an international  organization with 190 member countries. The IMF’s  fundamental mission is to en sure the stability of the  international monetary system. It does so in three ways:  surveillance of the global economy and the economies of  member countries; lending to  countries with balance of  payments difficulties; and giving practical help by providing technical assistance to members. It is headquartered in Washington, DC, USA.   The IMF conducts its operations and transactions through the  General Department. The General Department comprises three accounts: (i) the General  Resources Account (GRA);  (ii) the Investment Account (IA); and (iii) the Special Disbursement Account (SDA).  1.1  General Resources Account  The financial operations of the IMF with its members are  primarily conducted through the GRA. The assets and liabilities in the GRA reflect the payment of member quota  subscriptions, use and repayment of GRA credit, borrowings  and repayments to lenders, collection of charges from borrowers, payment of remuneration on creditor positions  and interest to lenders, and other operations.  A core responsibility of the IMF is to provide financial  assistance to member countries experiencing actual or  potential balance of payments pr oblems. Upon the request of  a member country, GRA resources are made available either  under a financing arrangement or in the form of outright  purchases (disbursements). An arrangement is a decision by  the IMF’s Executive Board (Executive Board) that gives a  member the assurance that the IMF stands ready to provide  resources to the member during a specified period and up to a specified amount, in accordance with the terms of the  relevant financing instrument.   The Stand-By Arrangement (SBA)  is designed for members  with balance of payments problems expected to be resolved  in the short to medium term. The Extended Fund Facility  (EFF) is a special facility in the GRA for members with longer-term balance of payments problems, the resolution of  which would require structural and more comprehensive  economic reforms. Resources under the SBA and the EFF are made available in phased installments as the member  implements economic policies and measures specified under the arrangement, subject to periodic reviews by the  Executive Board.  The Flexible Credit Line (FCL) is available for members with  very strong fundamentals, policies, and track records of  policy implementation and is intended for both crisis prevention and resolution. The Short-term Liquidity Line  (SLL) is designed to provide liquidity support and has several  innovative features, including revolving access. It has the  same qualification criteria as the FCL but is available only for  members facing potential moderate short-term balance of  payments needs arising due to capital account pressures.  The Precautionary and Liquidity Line (PLL) is available for  members with sound economic fundamentals but with some remaining vulnerabilities that pr eclude them from meeting the  qualification criteria for the FCL and the SLL.   The financing instrument for outright purchases is the Rapid  Financing Instrument (RFI), which is used by members facing  an urgent balance of payments need without the necessity or  capacity for a full-fledged program.  1.2  Investment Account  The IA holds resources transferred from the GRA, which are  invested to broaden the IMF’s income base. The Rules and Regulations of the IA adopted  by the Executive Board  provide the framework for the implementation of the expanded investment authorit y authorized under the Fifth  Amendment of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, which  became effective in February 2011. The IA comprises two  subaccounts: the Fixed-Income Subaccount and the Endowment Subaccount.   The Fixed-Income Subaccount holds resources transferred  from the GRA that are not relat ed to profits from gold sales.  With a view to generating income while protecting the IMF’s  balance sheet, the investment objective of the Fixed-Income  Subaccount is to produce returns in Special Drawing Rights  (SDRs) terms in excess of the th ree-month SDR interest rate  (see Notes 2.1 and 2.2) over time while minimizing the  frequency and extent of negative returns and  underperformance over an investment horizon of three to  four years. During financial year ended April 30, 2022, the  Executive Board concluded its 5- yearly review of the Fixed- Income Subaccount’s investment strategy and effective January 12, 2022, set the investment objective to achieve, over time, returns that exceed  the SDR interest rate by a  margin of 50 basis points. I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021    12 The Endowment Subaccount was credited with  SDR 4.4 billion in profits fr om gold sales during financial  years 2010 and 2011. The Endowment Subaccount’s investment objective is to achieve a real return of 3 percent in US dollar terms over the long term to contribute to covering  the IMF’s administrative expenditures, while preserving the  long-term real value of these assets.   1.3  Special Disbursement Account  The SDA is the vehicle used to receive profits from the sale of gold held by the IMF at  the time of the Second  Amendment of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement (April 1978).  SDA resources can be used for various purposes, as  specified in the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, including transfers to the GRA for immediate use in operations and  transactions, transfers to the IA, or operations and  transactions that are not authorize d by other provisions of the  IMF’s Articles of Agreement but are consis tent with the  mandate of the IMF, in particular to provide balance of payments assistance on special terms to low-income  member countries.  1.4  Other entities administered by the IMF  The IMF also administers the Special Drawing Rights  Department (SDR Department ), trusts (Concessional  Lending and Debt Relief Trusts), and special purpose accounts (Administered Accounts) established to fund financial and technical services consistent with the IMF’s  purposes. As the General Department does not have control  over these entities, their finan cial statements are presented  separately.  The resources of the SDR Department are held separately  from the assets of all t he other accounts owned or  administered by the IMF. As specified in the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, these resources may not be used to meet the liabilities, obligations, or losses incurred in the operations of  the General Department (or vice versa), except that  expenses of conducting the business of the SDR Department are paid by the General De partment and are then reimbursed  by the SDR Department.   The resources of the trusts and special purpose accounts are  contributed by members, by other  financial institutions, or by  the IMF through the SDA. The a ssets and liabilities of the  trusts and special purpose accounts are separate from the assets and liabilities of the General Department. The assets  of the trusts and special purpose accounts cannot be used to  meet the liabilities, obligations, or losses incurred in the  operations of the General  Department. The General  Department can be reimbursed for the expenses incurred in  conducting the business of certain trusts and accounts in  accordance with the IMF’s Articles of Agreement and  relevant decisions of the Executive Board. 1.5  Impact of geopolitical and global economic  developments  The COVID-19 pandemic has cr eated severe disruptions in  global economic activity. The IMF responded to the crisis  with unprecedented speed and  magnitude of financial  assistance, to help countries, notably to protect the most vulnerable and set the stage for economic recovery. A significant number of countri es benefited from emergency  financing through RFI purchases during the financial year ended April 30, 2021 (see Note 5.1). The IMF has also approved financial assistance under its lending arrangements  and augmented existing lending arrangements to  accommodate new needs arising from the impact of the pandemic during the financial years ended April 30, 2022,  and 2021 (see Schedule 3). As a result of this increased  financing activity, the General Department’s credit exposure has increased compared with the pre-pandemic level.  The evolution of the pandemic is  still subject to significant  uncertainty. Beyond April 30, 2022, slowing global growth  and elevated debt vulnerabilities could lead to further  demand for lending arrangements in the coming months. The war in Ukraine that started in February 2022 is expected to  have a significant negative effect on global growth through  commodity markets, trade, and, to a lesser extent, financial interlinkages. Economic and financial spillovers from the war  could also trigger additional demand for Fund financing.   The General Department continues to manage its risks in  accordance with its existing risk management framework  (see Note 4). As of the date of  these financial statements,  there had been no negative impact on the operational results of the General Department, in cluding from the impairment  analysis of its credit portfolio (see Note 5.1). See also Note  2.3 for the most significant estimates and judgements used in  the preparation of thes e financial statements.  The risk management practices described in Note 4.3 have  effectively mitigated the risk exposure of the effects of the  global developments on the investment portfolios. The  valuations of mark-to-market  financial instruments had fully  and rapidly recovered after a brief decline in value at the  onset of the pandemic. However,  in light of the war in  Ukraine, tightening monetary c onditions coupled with a sharp  increase in inflation and inflat ion expectations, the investment  portfolios remain subject to challenging market conditions  and high volatility. The effects of the global developments on  investments are also reflected in the value at risk (VaR) (see  Note 4.3.2.3). The valuation of  investments held at amortized  cost was not impacted. I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021     13 2.  Basis of preparation and measurement  The financial statements of t he General Department are  prepared in accordance with International Financial  Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International  Accounting Standards B oard (IASB). The financial  statements have been prepared under the historical cost  convention, except for the revalu ation of financial instruments  at fair value through profit or  loss. The financial statements  have also been prepared on t he basis that the General  Department will continue to op erate as a going concern.  2.1  Unit of account  The financial statements are presented in SDRs, which is the  IMF’s unit of account. The value of the SDR is determined  daily by the IMF by summing specific amounts of the basket  currencies in US dollar equivalents on the basis of market exchange rates. The IMF generally reviews the composition  of the SDR valuation basket at  five-year intervals. These  reviews cover the currencies to be included in the SDR valuation basket (along with the criteria for the selection of  currencies), determine the relative weights of those  currencies, and assess the fi nancial instruments that are  used to calculate the SDR interest rate. The current basket consists of five currencies. The weights and amounts of the  currencies in the basket, at April 30, 2022, and April 30,  2021, relative to 1 SDR, were as follows:  SDR basket curren cy Weight (in percent) Amount  Chinese renminbi 10.92 1.0174  Euro 30.93 0.38671  Japanese yen 8.33 11.900  Pound sterling 8.09 0.085946  US dollar  41.73 0.58252    At April 30, 2022, SDR 1 was equal to US$1.34430  (US$1.43599 at April 30, 2021).  The current SDR valuation basket was originally scheduled  to expire on September 30, 2021. However, the Executive  Board decided to extend it to July 31, 2022.  On May 11, 2022, the Exec utive Board concluded the  quinquennial review of the me thod of valuation of the SDR  and agreed to maintain the curr ent composition of the SDR  currency and interest rate baskets and approved their  updated weights. The updated basket implies slightly higher weights for the US dollar and the Chinese renminbi and,  accordingly, somewhat lower we ights for the British pound,  the euro, and the Japanese yen.   Effective August 1, 2022, t he SDR basket valuation basket  will be assigned the following weights:  SDR basket currency Weight (in percent)  Chinese renminbi 12.28  Euro 29.31  Japanese yen 7.59  Pound sterling 7.44  US dollar  43.38    The amounts of each of the five  currencies will be calculated  on July 29, 2022 (the transition date) in accordance with the  new weights. The next review of the method of valuation of  the SDR will take place in 2027, unless developments in the  interim justify an earlier review.   2.2  SDR interest rate  The SDR interest rate provides the basis for basic charges  levied on credit outstanding (see Note 17), interest on SDR  holdings (see Note 6), remuneration paid on members’  reserve tranche positions (see Note 18), and interest on  borrowings (see Note 14).   The SDR interest rate is determined weekly by reference to a  weighted average of yields or rates on short-term instruments  in the money markets of the members whose currencies are  included in the SDR valuation basket:   SDR basket currency Yield or rate  Chinese renminbi Three-month benchmark yield for China  Treasury bonds as published by the China  Central Depository and Clearing Co., Ltd.  Euro Three-month spot rate for euro area central  government bonds with a minimum rating of  AA published by the European Central  Bank  Japanese yen Three-month Treasury discount bills  Pound sterling Three-month Treasury bills  US dollar Three-month Treasury bills    The SDR interest rate is subject to a floor of 0.050 percent  and is rounded to three decimal places.   The average SDR interest rate was 0.107 percent per annum  and 0.077 percent per annum during the financial years  ended April 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively.  2.3  Use of estimates and judgement  The preparation of financ ial statements requires  management to make judgements, estimates, and assumptions that affect the app lication of accounting policies  and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.  Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an  ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021    14 recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised  and in any future periods affected.  The most significant estimates and judgements used in  applying accounting policies include expected credit losses measurement for credit outstanding and undrawn  commitments (see Notes 3.2.1.1 and 5.1), fair value  measurement of financial inst ruments (see Notes 3.10 and  8), and actuarial assumptions used in calculating the net assets/liabilities under retirement benefit plans (see Note 11.3).  3.  Summary of significant accounting policies  3.1  Financial instruments   Financial instruments include financial assets and financial liabilities described in Notes 3.2 and 3.7.  Measurement at initial recognition  Financial instruments are recognized when the General Department becomes a party to the contractual provisions of  the instrument. The General Department uses settlement  date accounting for all financial instruments except for  investments, which are accounted for using trade date  accounting (see Note 3.2.3). At initial recognition, a financial instrument is measured at it s fair value, which is best  evidenced by the transaction amount.   Derecognition Financial assets, or a portion thereof, are derecognized when  the contractual rights to rece ive the cash flows from the  assets have expired, or when they have been transferred and  either: (i) the General Department  transfers substantially all  the risks and rewards of owners hip; or (ii) the General  Department neither transfers nor retains substantially all the  risks and rewards of ownership but the General Department  has not retained control.   Financial liabilities are derecognized when they are  extinguished (i.e., when the obligation is discharged,  canceled, or expires).   Classification and subsequent measurement of  financial assets  A financial asset is classified on initial recognition based on two factors: the business model for managing the financial  asset and its contractual cash flow characteristics.   Financial assets that are held for collection of contractual  cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and intere st are measured at amortized  cost (AC). Interest income fr om these financial assets is  included in the statements of  income using the effective interest method. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is  recognized in the statements of income.   Financial assets that are held for collection of contractual  cash flows and for selling, where the assets’ cash flows  represent solely payments of principal and interest, would be  measured at fair value through other comprehensive income  (FVOCI). The General Departm ent did not have financial  assets at FVOCI during the financial years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021.  All other financial assets that do not meet the criteria to be  measured at AC or FVOCI are measured at fair value, with  changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss (FVPL).  Impairment  At each reporting date, the General Department assesses on  a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses (ECL)  associated with its financial assets at AC and with the  undrawn balances under its lending commitments. The  measurement of ECL reflects: (i) an unbiased and probability-weighted amou nt that is determined by evaluating  a range of possible outcomes; (ii) the time value of money; and (iii) reasonable and suppor table information that is  available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date about past events, current conditions, and forecasts of future economic conditions.   If the General Department neede d to recognize ECL, they  would be recorded as impairment allowances for assets at AC and as a liability provision for undrawn commitments.   Should any financial asset become credit-impaired, interest  income would be calculated for it by applying the effective interest rate to its amortized co st (i.e., net of the impairment  allowance).  Classification and subsequent measurement of  financial liabilities  Derivative financial liabilities are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss.   All other financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost. Interest expense from these financial liabilities is included in the statements of income using t he effective interest method.   3.2  Financial assets  3.2.1  Currencies  Currencies are financial assets that consist of members’  currencies held by the GRA with designated depositories, in  the form of account balances or non-interest-bearing  promissory notes that ar e encashable by the GRA on  demand. All currencies in the GRA are classified at AC. I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021     15  Usable currencies are currencies of members considered  to be in a sufficiently strong external position that they can  be used to finance GRA transactions with other members.    Currencies of members that are not considered to have a  sufficiently strong balance of payments and reserves  position to finance GRA transactions with other members are presented as other currencies.    Holdings of member currencies that represent purchases of usable currencies or SDRs in exchange for their own  currencies are presented as credit outstanding (see Note  3.2.1.1).   The currency balances in the statements of financial position include receivables and payables arising from currency  revaluations (see Note 5).  3.2.1.1  Credit outstanding and charges  Credit outstanding is a financial asset that represents  financing provided to members under the various GRA financing facilities (see Note 1.1). Members receive financing  in the GRA by purchasing SDRs or usable currencies in  exchange for their own currencies. GRA credit is repaid by  members by repurchasing holdings of their currencies in  exchange for SDRs or usable currencies.   Charges and fees  The GRA earns interest, referred to as basic charges, on  members’ use of GRA credit (see Note 17). Basic charges are recognized using the e ffective interest method.    In addition to basic charges, outstanding GRA credit is also subject to level-based and time-based surcharges (see Note 17). Surcharges are recognized when the relevant  level-based and time-based thresholds on credit outstanding  set by the Executive Board are reached.   Charges not received from members within the required  timeframe are recovered by the GRA under the burden- sharing mechanism, through adjustments to increase the rate  of charge for debtor member s and decrease the rate of  remuneration on members’ reserve tranche positions (see  Note 13.1).   A service charge is levied by the GRA on all purchases from  the GRA except reserve tranche purchases. Service charges are paid when the purchases are made and are recognized  as income upon payment.   A commitment fee is levied on the amount available for  financing under an arrangement for each 12-month period of  the arrangement. Except for SLL arrangements, commitment  fees are refunded as the member makes purchases under  the relevant arrangement. A prorated commitment fee is also  refunded for all arrangements in case of an arrangement’s cancellation. At the arrangement’s expiration or cancellation, any unrefunded amount is recognized as income. Pending refund or recognition as income, commitment fees are  recognized as part of other li abilities in the statements of  financial position. For SLL arrangements, the commitment  fee is nonrefundable upon purchases. Accordingly,  commitment fee income is recognized on a straight-line basis  over the duration of the SLL arrangement.  Impairment of credit outstanding The General Department’s assessment for impairment of its credit outstanding is grounded in  the context of the nature of  the IMF’s financing and its un ique institutional status:     The IMF has a unique relationship with its member countries, all of which are shar eholders in the institution.    IMF financing under arrangements is linked to regular reviews of performance under a program of economic  policies that the member commits to in order to overcome  balance of payments problems, return to external viability, and repay the IMF.    The IMF employs a comprehensive set of measures to mitigate credit risk (see Note 4.2.1).   The IMF also has de facto pref erred creditor status, which  has been recognized by the official community and generally accepted by private creditors.  Taken together, these factor s significantly reduce the  likelihood of the General Department incurring credit losses.   The General Department has not recognized any impairment  losses since inception. Also, unlik e large financial institutions  in the private sector, the General Department’s credit portfolio consists of a relatively small number of exposures to  its member countries, with eac h member’s circumstances  varying. Therefore, a stat istical approach to credit risk  assessment, such as probability of default (PD) and loss given default (LGD) modeling, as typically followed in the financial sector is neither feasible nor appropriate for the  General Department.   Similarly, the assessment of t he General Department’s credit  risk cannot rely on external credit risk ratings. Due to its  unique characteristics, the IMF’ s credit risk exposure is not  comparable to sovereign credit risk faced by commercial  financial entities and, as a cooperative member organization,  the IMF does not produce its own internal credit rating  grades. Accordingly, credit risk for the General Department is  assessed holistically based on  qualitative an d quantitative  considerations pertaining to each debtor member, such as  the status of the economic programs underlying IMF  financing, the member’s cooperation on policy  implementation and timely settlement of IMF financial obligations, and forward-looking assessment of the member’s  capacity to repay. I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021    16 The General Department has developed a model for ECL  estimation based on changes in credit quality since initial  recognition, where credit qualit y is referred to as Stage 1,  Stage 2, and Stage 3. Credit out standing for which credit risk  has increased significantly since initial recognition (Stage 2), or that is credit-impaired (S tage 3), has its ECL measured on  a lifetime basis. Credit outstan ding for which there has been  no significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition  (Stage 1) has its ECL measured as a portion of lifetime ECL  that result from default events possible within the next  12 months.  The key judgements and assumptions adopted by the  General Department in t he measurement of ECL are  discussed below :  (i) Definition of defaul t and credit-impaired   The General Department considers a member country to be  in default when it is six months or more overdue in settling its  financial obligations to the General Department. This rebuts the presumption that  default occurs no later than 90 days  past due, reflecting the nature of the IMF’s financing and its unique institutional status as well as consistency with the  threshold for internal risk management purposes. Credit outstanding is considered cred it-impaired when the obligation  has defaulted.   (ii) Significant increase in credit risk  The General Department assesses whether a significant increase in credit risk has occurred on a member-by-member  basis by comparing the risk of default at the reporting date  with the risk of default at t he date of the most recent  disbursement to the debtor member. The assessment is  performed on each reporting date and takes into account a  range of qualitative and quantitative criteria, including  overdue obligations to the IMF, signals of noncooperation by  the member, and forward-looking indicators of capacity to repay the IMF. The criteria used to identify significant  increases in credit risk are monitored and reviewed for  appropriateness at least annually.   The assessment does not rely on any single factor and may,  on the basis of other relevant considerations, rebut the  presumption that credit risk has increased significantly when contractual payments are mo re than 30 days past due.  During the financial years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021, the General Department did not have any member more than 30 days past due, except for one member in protracted  arrears at April 30, 2021, which were subsequently settled  (see Note 5.2).  (iii) Low credit risk   The General Department assumes that the credit risk of a member country has not increased significantly since initial recognition if the member is determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date, as defined below.   Credit risk related to the General Department’s exposure to a member country is considered low if: (i) it has a low risk of default; (ii) the member country  has a strong capacity to meet  its contractual cash flow obligations in the near term; and (iii) adverse changes in economic and business conditions in  the longer term may, but will not necessarily, reduce the  ability of the member country to fulfill its contractual cash flow  obligations.   (iv) Measuring ECL  ECL are determined by comparing expected cash flows with contractual cash flows and discounting the expected cash  shortfalls at the effective interest  rate, which is the basic rate  of charge. ECL are estima ted by assessing a range of  possible outcomes in light of expected future economic  conditions, weighted according to the assessed probability of  each outcome. This entails considerable judgement and uncertainty about the estimates.   For the purpose of ECL measurement, financial safeguards that are integral to the IMF’s financial structure and  operations are also considered, such as the burden-sharing  mechanism to compensa te the IMF for loss of income due to  overdue payments (see Note  13.1) and the Special  Contingent Account (SCA-1) to pr otect the IMF in case of the  ultimate failure of a member to repay its overdue obligations to the GRA (see Note 13.2).  Write-off  In the unlikely event that a member with credit outstanding (i) withdraws from the IMF; ( ii) repudiates its outstanding  obligations to the General Depar tment; and (iii) there are no  prospects of recovering amounts due to the General  Department in the foreseeable future, the IMF would  recognize the ultimate loss and the withdrawn member’s credit outstanding to the G eneral Department would be  written off.   3.2.2  SDR holdings   SDR holdings represent SDRs held by the GRA (see Note 6).  SDR holdings are measured at AC.  Interest on SDR holdings is recognized using the effective  interest method.   3.2.3  Investments   Investments are financial assets that include equity securities, real estate investment trusts (REITs), private  infrastructure debt, fixed-in come securities, short-term  investments, fixed-term deposits, and derivative assets. Derivative liabilities are disclosed as part of other liabilities in  the statements of fi nancial position.  I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021     17 Investments in each of the tw o subaccounts are managed in  accordance with their respective investment strategy (see  Note 7) and their performance is evaluated on a fair value  basis. The business model for the invested portfolios focuses on achieving fair value gains. Accordingly, these securities  are classified at FVPL. Funds pending suitable investment in  accordance with the investment  strategy may be kept in  fixed-term deposits, which are measured at amortized cost.  Purchases and sales of investments are recognized on the  trade date. The corresponding investment trades receivable  or payable are recognized in other assets and other liabilities,  respectively, pending settlement of a transaction.  Investment income compri ses interest income on  investments at AC, interest and dividend income, and  realized and unrealized gains and losses from FVPL investments, including currency valuation differences arising  from exchange rate movements against the SDR, net of all  trading-related fees.  Interest income from investments is recognized using the  effective interest method. Dividend income is recognized  based on the ex-dividend date.  3.3  Cash and cash equivalents   Usable currencies and SDR holdings are considered cash and cash equivalents in the statements of cash flows.  3.4  Gold holdings  Gold holdings (acquired prior to the Second Amendment of  the IMF’s Articles of Agreement in April 1978) are carried at  historical cost using the spec ific identification method. The  carrying value is determined by the restrictions on the use of  the IMF’s gold holdings and the di sposition of profits from the  sale of gold. In accordance with the provisions of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, whenever the IMF sells gold that was  held on the date of the e ffectiveness of the Second  Amendment of the IMF’s Articles  of Agreement, that portion  of the proceeds equal to the hist orical cost must be placed in  the GRA. Any proceeds in excess of the historical cost will be held in the SDA or transferred to the Endowment Subaccount  of the IA (see Note 9). The IMF may also sell such gold  holdings to those members that were members on August 1, 1975, in exchange for their currencies and at a price equal to  the historical cost.  3.5  Property, plant and equipment and intangible  assets  Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are  measured at historical cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization. Property, plant and equipment and intangible  assets are capitalized and depreciated or amortized over the  estimated remaining useful lives using the straight-line method. Buildings are deprecia ted over 30 years and other  property, plant and equipment over 3 to 20 years. Leasehold  improvements are depreciated ov er the term of the lease  agreement. Software is amortized over three to five years.  3.6  Post-employment benefits  The IMF sponsors various post-employment benefit plans for its employees, which include defined benefit and other  post-employment benefits such as medical and life insurance  benefits (see Note 11).  The net asset/liability under each retirement benefits plan  recognized in the statements of financial position is the  present value of the defined ben efit obligation less the fair  value of the plan assets. Changes resulting from remeasurements are reported in other comprehensive  income. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined using the projecte d unit credit method by  discounting the estimated future cash outflows using market  yields on high-quality corporate bonds.   Net periodic pension cost includes service cost and net  interest cost on the net asse ts/liabilities under retirement  benefit plans.  3.7  Financial liabilities  3.7.1  Special Contingent Account The SCA-1 was used by the General Department to  accumulate precautionary balances under the burden- sharing mechanism (see Note 13.2) against possible credit  default. Balances in the SCA-1 are akin to refundable non-interest-bearing deposits.   3.7.2  Borrowings   Borrowings are financial liabilities that represent financing  received under the various borrowing arrangements  (see Note 14).  Interest expense on borrowings is calculated by applying the  effective interest method.   3.7.3  Quota subscriptions   Members’ quota subscriptions are financial liabilities that  represent subscription payments by members, including  payments as a result of quota increases (see Note 15.1). An increase in quota subscription for an existing member  becomes effective when the member both consents to the  quota increase and makes the actual payment (provided that any other requirements for the effectiveness of the specific  quota increase are met), and the increase is recorded in the financial statements on the payment  date. Typically, about a  quarter of a member’s quota subscription (reserve asset portion) is paid either in SDRs or in the currencies of other members specified by the IMF, or in any combination of I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021    18 SDRs and such currencies; and the remainder is paid in the  member’s own currency.   Quota subscriptions are cla ssified as liabilities in the  statements of financial position, as they embody an  unconditional repayment obligation in the case of a member’s  withdrawal from the IMF.  3.7.3.1  Reserve tranche positions and remuneration  A member acquires a reserve tranche position in the GRA in  exchange for the reserve asset portion of its quota subscription payment, and from the use of the member’s  currency in the GRA’s transactions or operations (see  Note 15.2).   The GRA pays interest, referr ed to as remuneration, on a  remunerated portion of t he member’s reserve tranche  position (see Note 18). Remuneration expense is recognized  on an accrual basis.   3.8  Provisions  Provisions are recognized when the IMF has a current legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is  probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made. Provisions are measured at  the present value of the amoun ts that are expected to be  paid to settle the obligations.  3.9  Foreign currency translation  Transactions denominated in currencies and not in SDRs are  recorded at the rate of exchange on the date of the  transaction. Assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies are reported using the SDR exchange rate on the  date of the financial statements. Exchange differences  arising from the settlement of transactions at rates different  from those at the originating date of the transactions are  included in the determination of net income.  3.10  Fair value measurement  Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between  market participants at the m easurement date. A fair value  measurement is based on th e presumption that the  transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either in the principal market for the asset or liability or, in the absence of a principal market, in the most  advantageous market.  A three-level fair value hierarchy is used to determine fair  value under which financial instruments are categorized  based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique. The fair value hierarchy has the following levels:  When the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset  or liability fall within multiple le vels of the hierarchy, the level  within which the fair value me asurement is categorized is  based on the lowest-level input t hat is significant to the fair  value measurement of the instrument in its entirety. Thus, a  Level 3 fair value measurement may include inputs that are  both observable and unobservable. Transfers in and out of  the fair value hierarchy levels  are recognized at the end of  the reporting period.  The valuation techniques used to determine fair value are  described in Note 8.  3.11  Amendments to existing standards that became  effective in the financial year ended April 30, 2022  Amendments to IFRS 9, “Financial Instruments”, and IFRS 7,  “Financial Instruments: Disclosures” were issued in August 2020 to address financial reporting issues related to the  reform of an interest rate benchmark, including its  replacement with alternative benchmark rates. The  amendments are effective for annual periods starting on or  after January 1, 2021, and were adopted by the General  Department on May 1, 2021. The amendments had no  material effect on the General Department’s financial  statements.  3.12  Amendments to existing standards effective in  future years  The following amendments to existing standards issued by  the IASB will become effective in  future financial years.   Amendments to IFRS 9, “Financial Instruments” were issued in May 2020 to clarify certain aspects of derecognition of financial liabilities. The amendm ents are effective for annual  periods starting on or after January 1, 2022. The amendments will be adopted by t he General Department for  the financial year ending Ap ril 30, 2023, and are not  expected to have a material effect on the General Department’s financial statements.  Amendments to IAS 1, “Pre sentation of Financial  Statements” and IFRS Prac tice Statement 2, “Making  Materiality Judgements” were issued in February 2021 to  help entities apply materiality judgements to accounting  policy disclosures. The amendments are effective for annual Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical  assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the  measurement date;   Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly  (i.e., derived from prices);  Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021     19 periods starting on or after January 1, 2023. The  amendments will be adopted by t he General Department for  the financial year ending Ap ril 30, 2024, and are not  expected to have a material effect on the General Department’s financial statements.  Amendments to IAS 8, “Accounting Policies, Changes in  Accounting Estimates and Errors” were issued in February  2021 to clarify the definition of accounting estimate. The  amendments are effective for annual periods starting on or  after January 1, 2023. The amendments will be adopted by  the General Department for the financial year ending  April 30, 2024, and are not expected to have a material effect on the General Department’ s financial statements.  4.  Financial risk management   The General Department is exposed to various types of  operational and financial risks, including credit, market, and  liquidity risks.  4.1  Risk management framework  By virtue of its role establishe d through the IMF’s Articles of  Agreement, the IMF faces a range of financial and nonfinancial risks. The Executive Board has approved a risk  acceptance statement guiding risk acceptance and  assessment across the IMF’s activities. The IMF has adopted the three lines of defense model for risk management.   Risks inherent in day-to-day o perations are mitigated by  establishing and main taining a system of internal controls.   A risk management function is responsible for developing  and maintaining the risk management framework, fostering the development of  risk management tools, and  reporting on the General Depart ment’s overall risk profile,  highlighting areas where additional mitigation efforts are needed.    An internal audit function is responsible for providing an independent assessment of  the effectiveness of  governance and internal control processes.    Oversight is provided by committees established to monitor  and make decisions in specific risk areas, which supports the  cycle of risk assessment, ownership, and mitigation vis-à-vis risk acceptance.   4.2  Financial assets and liabilities other than  investments  Financial assets and liabilities other than investments are  exposed to credit, market, and liquidity risks. 4.2.1  Credit risk on financial assets and liabilities other than  investments  Credit risk is the risk of suffering financial losses, should any  of the IMF’s members fail to fulfill their financial obligations to the GRA. Credit risk arises on credit outstanding and  undrawn committed amounts under approved financing  commitments.  Credit risk is inherent in the IMF’s unique role in the  international monetary system  because the IMF has limited  ability to diversify its credit portfolio and generally provides  financing when other sources of credit are not available to a  member. In addition, the IMF’s credit concentration is generally high due to the nature of the financial assistance  provided to its member countries.  Measures to help mitigate the IMF’s credit risk in financing  arrangements include program design and conditionality,  which serve to help member countries solve their balance of  payments problems within the period of an IMF-supported program and to provide the ne eded assurances that the  member will be able to repay the IMF. Other risk mitigating policies include access limits, post financing assessments,  surcharge policies, preventive and remedial measures for  dealing with overdue financial obligations, and the burden- sharing mechanism (see Note 13).   The IMF has established limits on overall access to  resources in the GRA, except for the FCL arrangements that are not subject to any access limits (for limits applicable to  SLL arrangements, see below). The annual limit is normally  set at 145 percent of a member ’s quota, with a cumulative  limit of 435 percent of a mem ber’s quota (net of scheduled  repurchases). In response to the COVID-19 crisis, the annual  limit was temporarily increased to 245 percent of quota  annually for the period from July 13, 2020, through  December 31, 2021.   Access in excess of these limits can be granted in  exceptional circumstances. Except for PLL arrangements,  there is no prespecified maximum on exceptional access to IMF resources, which is assessed on a case-by-case basis in  accordance with the policy framework on exceptional access.  The IMF assesses factors such as the size of balance of  payments needs, the member’s debt sustainability and its  ability to regain access to financing from other sources, the  member’s capacity to repay the Fund, and the strength of  policies to be adopted.   PLL arrangements have a cumulative access limit of  500 percent of quota (net of scheduled repurchases). Access  under a six-month PLL arrangement is subject to a limit of  125 percent of quota. In exceptional circumstances where a member is experiencing or has the potential to experience  larger short-term balance of payments needs due to the I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021    20 impact of exogenous shocks, including heightened regional  or global stress conditions, access under a six-month PLL  arrangement is subject to a higher limit of 250 percent of  quota.  SLL arrangements have revolving access, and multiple  purchases and repurchases may take place during the  course of the arrangement, subj ect to a limit of 145 percent  of quota on the total credit outstanding at any given date under current or any prior SLL arrangements.   Further, in September 2020, the IMF established policy  safeguards when a member requests financing with  combined access to GRA and Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRG Trust) resources in excess of specified  thresholds. These thresholds are set at the same levels that  trigger application of the GRA exceptional access framework.  The safeguards are also broadly aligned with the criteria and  procedures applied in the GRA exceptional access  framework described above. There were no limits on combined access to GRA and PRG Trust resources prior to  September 2020.  The annual limit for RFI purchases is normally set at 50  percent of a member’s quota, with a cumulative limit of 100  percent of a member’s quota ( net of scheduled repurchases).  These limits were temporarily increased to 100 percent of  quota annually and 150 percent of  quota cumulatively (net of  scheduled repurchases) for the period from April 6, 2020,  through June 30, 2023.  Purchases under SBA and EFF arrangements are made in  tranches and are subject to conditionality in the form of performance criteria, indicative targets, structural  benchmarks, and prior actions, as well as regular reviews by  the Executive Board.   In addition, the IMF has adopted a safeguards policy to  mitigate the risk of misuse of resources and a misreporting policy to deal with incorrect reporting of data or performance  against any conditions under an IMF-supported program.  Safeguards assessments of member central banks are undertaken to provide the IMF with reasonable assurance  that the central bank’s legal structure, governance, control,  reporting, and auditing systems are adequate to maintain the integrity of its operations and to manage resources, including  IMF disbursements. When IMF resources are provided as  direct budget financing to the government, the safeguards policy also requires that IMF disbursements be deposited at  the central bank, and that an appropriate framework  agreement between the central bank and the government be  in place to ensure timely servicing of the member’s financial  obligations to the IMF. Further, a fiscal safeguards review of the state treasury is requir ed for cases where a member requests exceptional access, and at least 25 percent of IMF funds are expected to be used fo r direct budget financing.   The maximum credit risk exposure is the carrying value of the IMF’s credit outstanding a nd undrawn commitments.   4.2.1.1  Credit outstanding  Credit outstanding comprised SDR 93,031 million and  SDR 89,788 million at April 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively  (see Note 5). The concentration of GRA outstanding credit by  region was as follows:     The use of credit in the GRA by the largest users was as  follows:    The five largest users of GRA credit at April 30, 2022, and 2021, in descending order, were Argentina, Egypt, Ukraine,  Pakistan, and Ecuador. Credit outstanding by member is  presented in Schedule 1.  In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant number  of countries have benefited from emergency financial  assistance under the RFI (see Note 5.1), including 21  countries with a total disbursed amount of SDR 9,480 million  that did not have credit outst anding from the IMF at March  31, 2020. There is no ex-post program-based conditionality or reviews under the RFI, with overall conditionality limited.  4.2.1.2  Undrawn commitments  Undrawn commitments under GRA arrangements amounted  to SDR 102,614 million and SDR 93,457 million at April 30,  2022, and 2021, respectively. Commitments and undrawn balances under current arrangements are presented in  Schedule 3.

General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021     21 No purchases under RFIs had been approved by the  Executive Board, but not yet disbursed at April 30, 2022  (SDR 630 million at April 30, 2021).   The undrawn commitments under GRA arrangements have  also increased as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic (see  Note 1.5) as the IMF has approved new financial assistance under its lending arrangements (including to four countries  that had not had a lending arrangement with, or credit  outstanding to the IMF at Ma rch 31, 2020) and augmented  existing lending arrangements to accommodate urgent new  needs arising from the impact of the pandemic.  4.2.2  Market risk on financial assets and liabilities other than  investments Market risk is the risk that the fa ir value or future cash flows  of financial instruments will fl uctuate because of changes in  market prices. Market risk for financial assets and liabilities other than investments includes interest rate risk and  exchange rate risk.  4.2.2.1  Interest rate risk  Interest rate risk is the risk t hat future net cash flows will  fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. All interest-bearing financial instru ments other than investments  of the General Department accr ue interest either at the SDR  interest rate or at a rate that is linked to the SDR interest rate  (see Note 2.2). Interest rate risk is primarily managed by  linking the rate of charge directly, by means of a fixed margin, to the cost of financing (which is equal to the SDR  interest rate).   4.2.2.2  Exchange rate risk  Exchange rate risk is the risk that the General Department’s  financial position and cash flows will be affected by  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.    The General Department has no exchange rate risk  exposure on its holdings of members’ currencies in the GRA because members maintain the value of such  holdings in SDR terms (see Note 5).    The General Department has other assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than SDRs and makes  administrative payments largely in US dollars, but the exchange rate risk exposure associated with these  activities is limited.    The General Department has no exchange rate exposure  from its current borrowing arrangements because all  drawings are denominated in SDRs.  4.2.3  Liquidity risk on financial assets and liabilities other than investments  Liquidity risk is the risk to the General Department of  nonavailability of resources to meet the financing needs of  members and its own obligations. The IMF must have usable resources available to meet members’ demand for IMF  financing. While the IMF’s resources are largely of a  revolving nature, uncertainties in the timing and amount of  credit extended to members during financial crises expose the IMF to liquidity risk. Moreover, the IMF must also stand  ready to provide resources for unexpected needs, for  example, to: (i) meet, upon a member’s representation of  need, potential demands for a drawing on the member’s  reserve tranche; and (ii) authorize drawings to meet demands for encashment of creditor claims under the New  Arrangements to Borrow (NAB) or the bilateral borrowing  agreements (see Note 14).  The IMF manages its liquidity risk by closely scrutinizing  developments in its liquidity position. The IMF’s main liquidity  measure—Forward Commitment Capacity -represents the  IMF’s capacity to make new GRA resources available to its  members over the following 12 months (see Schedule 2).   Long-term liquidity needs are addressed by reviewing the  adequacy of quota-based resources. General reviews of  members’ quotas are conducted at regular intervals to  evaluate the adequacy of quot a-based resources to meet  members’ demand for IMF financing. The IMF may also borrow to supplement its quota resources (see Note 14).  Short-term liquidity needs for financing activities are reviewed  and approved by the Executive Board on a periodic basis  through a financial transactions plan for quota resources and  the resource mobilization plan for borrowed resources.   4.2.3.1  Maturity profile of fi nancial assets and liabilities other  than investments  Depending on the type of financing instrument, repurchase  periods for GRA credit vary from 3¼ to 10 years. Scheduled  and overdue repurchases of outstanding GRA credit are  summarized below:      Repayments of outstanding borrowings are determined  according to the schedule of repurchases of credit that was  financed by borrowed resources. They also take into account  the maximum maturity of outstanding borrowings, which was  April 30, 2022  April 30, 2021   Financial year (in millions of SDRs )  2022 —  8,961  2023 19,198  19,777  2024 23,252  24,006  2025  18,497  18,183  2026 9,494  7,842  2027 6,446  3,692  2028 and beyond 16,144  7,185  Overdue —  142  Total 93,031  89,788  I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021    22 equal to 10 years for all outstanding borrowings. Scheduled  repayments of outstanding borrowings are summarized  below:    Repurchases during the financial years ended April 30, 2022,  and 2021, included advance repurchases of SDR 3,797 million and SDR 3,677 million, respectively.  These advance repurchases resulted in earlier than  scheduled repayments of outstanding borrowings of SDR 1,134 million and SDR 2,094 million, respectively.  Future interest payments on borrowings calculated at the  SDR interest rate at April 30, 2022, represent SDR 10 million for the financial year ending April 30, 2023. Thereafter, a total  of SDR 3 million will be paid th rough the last repayment date.  Usable and other currencies, SDR holdings, and quota subscriptions do not have maturity dates.  4.3  Investments  Investments are exposed to credit, market, and liquidity risks.  4.3.1  Credit risk on investments  Credit risk on investments repr esents the potential loss if  issuers and counterparties were to default on their  contractual obligations.   Credit risk in the IA is minimized by limiting fixed-income  investments to financial instrum ents with a credit rating at the  time of acquisition:   For the Fixed-Income Subaccount, effective January 12,  2022 the minimum credit rating is set at the equivalent of  BBB– (based on Standard & Poor’s long-term rating scale)  for corporate bonds and BBB+ for all other assets (at least A for all assets before January 12, 2022).    For the Endowment Subaccount, the minimum credit rating is set at BBB+ for so vereign bonds and BBB– for  corporate bonds and private infrastructure debt. Limited holdings in the Endowment Subaccount of corporate  bonds and private infrastructure debt rated below BBB–  are permitted under the Rules and Regulations of the  Investment Account.   Exempt from the credit rating requirement are instruments  issued by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS),  which does not have a credit ra ting, central bank deposits,  and short-term instruments.  The carrying amount of the fixed-income instruments represents the maximum exposure to credit risk. The credit  risk exposure for fixed-income instruments in the IA, at the  end of the respective reporting periods, was as follows:   Fixed-Income Subaccount    April 30, 2022 April 30, 2021  (as a percentage of total investments in  fixed-income instruments)   Not rated (BIS) — 0.0% 2,557 15.6%  AAA  5,422 29.3% 5,918 36.2%  AA+ to AA–  7,075 38.3% 3,435 21.0%  A+ to A  5,741 31.1% 4,305 26.4%  BBB+ 240 1.3% 125 0.8%  Total  18,478 100.0% 16,340 100.0%      Counterparty risk for derivative instruments is mitigated by strict exposure limits, cr edit rating requirements, and  collateral requirements. The ma ximum exposure to credit risk  for derivative instruments is the amount of any unrealized  gains on such contracts.   The credit risk exposure for derivative instruments in the  Fixed-Income Subaccount amounted to SDR 106 million and  SDR 38 million at April 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The  credit risk exposure for derivative instruments in the Endowment Subaccount amounted to SDR 58 million and  SDR 5 million at April 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively.  4.3.2  Market risk on investments  Market risk is the risk that the fa ir value or future cash flows  of financial instruments will fl uctuate because of changes in  market prices. Market risk for investments incl udes interest  rate risk, exchange rate risk, and other price risks.  The investment objectives of the Fixed-Income and  Endowment Subaccounts differ, and the investment  strategies, including asset allocation and risk tolerance, are  tailored for each of the subacc ounts, thereby exposing them  to different types of market risk.

General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021     23 4.3.2.1  Fixed-Income Subaccount  The Fixed-Income Subaccount holds debt obligations of a  broad range of issuers within limits defined by the Rules and  Regulations of the IA (see Note 7.1 for the eligible investments). Market risk is mitigated through asset class  diversification and within asset classes through broad security selection.   The Fixed-Income Subaccount authorizes the use of  derivative instruments for managing interest rate risk, currency hedging, or reducing co sts in the context of portfolio  balancing, benchmark replication, and market access. Safeguards are in place against short selling and financial leverage.  Exchange rate risk is mitigated by hedging investments  denominated in non-SDR currencies into SDR basket currencies with the objective of preserving the Fixed-Income  Subaccount’s SDR basket composition.  4.3.2.2  Endowment Subaccount   Investments are divided into eight categories, which are  subject to varying market risks and benefits from  diversification properties (see  Note 7.2 for the eligible  investments). Market risk is mitigated through asset class  diversification and within asset classes through broad security selection.   Effective January 12, 2022, except for the allocation to  emerging market equities, which may be managed actively, all Endowment Subaccount assets shall be managed  passively (prior to January 12, 2022, the Endowment  Subaccount was split into the passively-managed portfolio managed in accordance with the strategic asset allocation  and the actively-managed portfolio, which could comprise up  to 10 percent of the Endowment assets, invested in the same  asset categories with target  shares for fixed-income  instruments and equities with out specific allocation  requirements within those shares).   The Endowment Subaccount authorizes the use of derivative  instruments for managing interest rate risk, currency hedging, or reducing costs in the cont ext of portfolio balancing,  benchmark replication, and market access.   Because the IMF’s administrative expenditures are largely in  US dollars and the Endowment Subaccount’s general  objective is to contribute to  covering such expenditures (see  Note 1.2), the performance of the Endowment Subaccount is  measured in US dollars as the base currency but translated into SDRs for financial reporting. The Rules and Regulations  of the IA provide for hedging against the exchange rate risk  for fixed-income instruments denominated in developed  market currencies vis-à-vis the US dollar. The valuation changes from exchange rate fluctuations are included in the determination of investment income.   4.3.2.3  Value at risk  Exposures to market risk, including interest rate, exchange rate, and other price risks, are measured using VaR, which  considers known market risks in each of the asset categories  and the effect of asset class diversification. VaR estimates  reported below represent the maximum potential loss in  value of the assets over the ne xt year due to adverse market  movements with a 95 percent c onfidence level. There is a  1 in 20 chance that annual losses on investment assets are equal to or exceed the reported VaR. Losses in a single year could exceed the reported VaR by a significant amount.  The VaR model is based on historical simulations with a  three-year look back period and monthly overlapping risk factor returns for each individual instrument in the portfolios  to produce plausible future scenarios based on these  simulations. In each simulation scenario, risk factor data on the valuation date is shocked according to past observations  and each instrument is repriced, resulting in a hypothetical  empirical distribution of re turns. There is no standard  methodology for estimating VaR, and the modeling of the market risk characteristics of the investments involves many  assumptions and some limited pr oxy or substitutes. Different  assumptions or methodologies would produce significantly different VaR estimates.   The VaR for the Fixed-Income Subaccount portfolio was as  follows:   April 30, 2022 April 30, 2021   (in millions of SDRs )  Tranche 1 (see Note 7) 169 65  Tranche 2 (see Note 7) 107 58  Diversification effects (26) (47)  Total Fixed-Income Subaccount 250 76   I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021    24 The VaR for the Endowment Subaccount portfolio was as  follows:   April 30, 2022 April 30, 2021   (in millions of SDRs )  Passively managed portfolio:   Developed market equities 397 493  Emerging market equities 182 203  Global Sovereign bonds 66 —  Developed market sovereign bonds n/a1 65  Developed market corporate bonds 60 51  Emerging market bonds n/a1 17  US Treasury Inflation-Protected        Securities 68 52  Real estate investment trusts 175 97  Private infrastructure debt 17 5  Infrastructure equities 55 —  Diversification effects (296) (236)  Total for passively managed  portfolio 724 747  Actively managed portfolio:    Fixed-income securities — 10  Equity securities — 39  Diversification effects — (11)  Total for actively managed portfolio — 38  1 Following the changes to the investment  strategy approved by the Executive  Board on January 12, 2022, the investment categories of developed market  sovereign bonds and emerging market bonds were restructured into the global sovereign bonds category.     4.3.3  Liquidity risk on investments  Liquidity risk on investments refers to the risk that an investment will not have an active buyer or seller when  traded, which could negatively affect the price of the  investment.  The IA’s liquidity needs are low and the liquidity risk is  minimal because both subaccounts hold the majority of their resources in readily marketable short-term investments. 4.3.3.1  Maturity profile of investments The maturities of the fixed-income securities and derivatives  in the Fixed-Income Subaccount were as follows:     April 30, 2022 April 30, 2021  Financial year  (in millions of SDRs)   2022  — 6,909  2023 5,659 3,131  2024 5,294 2,179  2025  3,346 1,554  2026 2,110 1,254  2027 1,535 425  2028 and beyond 891 1,154  Total 18,835 16,606   The maturities of the fixed-income securities and derivatives  in the Endowment Subaccount were as follows:   April 30, 2022 April 30, 2021  Financial year  (in millions of SDRs)   2022  — 392  2023 496 376  2024 344 396  2025  388 455  2026 390 461  2027 361 303  2028 and beyond 1,331 1,346  Total 3,310 3,729    Investments in both subaccounts largely represent liquid  investments, which could be sold earlier than their maturity,  whenever necessary.  4.4  Post-employment benefit plans  The General Department is exposed to investment, liquidity, and longevity risks associated wit h post-employment benefit  plans (the Plans). These risks are balanced a gainst the need  to meet the financial obligations of each plan. The Plans have adopted general guidelines on permissible investments and plan assets are invested a ccording to a strategic asset  allocation, which is expected to generate a rate of return at or in excess of the rate of growth in the Plans’ liabilities. The strategic asset allocation is reviewed periodically by the  Investment Committee. The strategic asset allocation is  designed to minimize the level of portfolio market risk  (volatility) for the targeted rate of return, while better aligning  portfolio volatility with the potential volatility of the Plans’  liabilities. Through a global, multiple-asset-class investment  approach, the portfolio risk is r educed for any targeted rate of  return, because asset class returns are not perfectly  correlated as regional and global economic, financial, and political events unfold. The Pl ans do not utilize specific,  targeted asset-liability matching  instruments or strategies I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021     25 such as annuities, longevity swaps, cash flow matching, or  duration matching.  The primary objective with respect to liquidity is to have  sufficient liquid resources available to pay benefits when due. This risk is monitored to ensure that payments due to the  participants and beneficiaries can be met from the holdings  of cash and highly liquid investments of the Plans.  4.5  Precautionary balances  Precautionary balances consist of the GRA reserves (excluding that portion repres enting the profits from the  2009–10 gold sales that have been earmarked for the  Endowment Subaccount), and t he balance in the SCA-1.  They are a key element of the Fund’s multilayered risk  management framework as they provide a buffer to protect  the Fund against unexpected losses resulting from credit,  income, and other financial risks. The Executive Board conducted an interim review of the adequacy of  precautionary balances in December 2021, ahead of the  standard two-year cycle given the need for close monitoring  due to the heightened uncertainty in the global economy  linked to the pandemic and the path and timing of the recovery. In concluding the interim review, the Executive  Board kept the medium-term indicative target and minimum  floor for precautionary balances at SDR 25 billion and SDR 15 billion, respectively (the medium-term indicative  target had been raised from SDR 20 billion to SDR 25 billion  during the previous review of the precautionary balances in November 2020).  During the December 2021 interim review, the Executive  Board approved a new approach for the treatment of retirement benefit plans in th e computation of precautionary  balances. This approach better reflects the role of precautionary balances as a long-term buffer for economic  and financial risks. Under the new approach, referred to as  the ‘economic basis’, the defined benefit liability of the plans  is measured using a discount rate that reflects the  expected  long-term return on plan assets. Any net liability measured under the economic basis is used in calculating precautionary balances in place of the net asset/liability  calculated under IAS 19 (see Note 11). However, any net  asset measured under the economic basis would not be used in calculating precautionary bala nces. The change took effect  from May 1, 2021. A one-time increase of SDR 205 million was made to precautionary ba lances as at that date,  reflecting the accumulated net loss to date, to align with the new measurement methodology.   At April 30, 2022, and 2021, precautionary balances  amounted to SDR 20.9 billion and SDR 20.0 billion,  respectively, and were calculated as follows:   April 30, 2022  April 30, 2021   (in millions of SDRs)  Special Reserve (Note 16)  13,692 11,347  General Reserve (Note 16) 12,832 12,003  Excluding profits from gold sales (4,403) (4,403)  Adjustment for net assets/liabilities under  retirement benefit plans under  IAS 19 (Note 11.2) (1,248) n/a  Adjustment for net liabilities  under retirement benefit plans  under the economic basis —1 n/a   SCA-1 (Note 13.2)   — 1,066  Total precautionary balances 20,873 20,013  1 The measurement of the retirement benefit plans under the economic basis  resulted in a net pension asset at April 30, 2022. As such, further adjustments to  precautionary balances were not required after excluding the net assets/liabilities determined under IAS 19.  5.  Currencies, including credit outstanding  Under the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, members are  required to maintain the value of the GRA’s holdings of their  currencies in terms of the SDR. Any depreciation or  appreciation in a member’s currency vis-à-vis the SDR gives  rise to a currency valuation adjustment receivable or payable that must be settled by the mem ber promptly after the end of  the financial year or at other times as requested by the IMF  or the member. Currency holdi ngs of SDR 454,718 million at  April 30, 2022, included receivables and payables arising  from those valuation adjustm ents of SDR 19,796 million and  SDR 13,073 million, respectively (currency holdings of  SDR 458,656 million at April 30, 2021, included receivables  and payables of SDR 25,618 million and SDR 10,182 million,  respectively).  All holdings of members’ currencies are typically revalued at  the IMF’s financial year-end.   5.1  Credit outstanding  At April 30, 2022, and 2021, members’ use of GRA credit  was represented by currency holdings of SDR 93,031 million  and SDR 89,788 million, respectively. I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021    26 Changes in credit outstanding under the various facilities of  the GRA were as follows:  1 Other facilities include legacy credit under Enlarged Access and Supplementary  Financing Facility.    1 Other facilities include legacy credit under Enlarged Access and Supplementary  Financing Facility.    5.1.1  Emergency financial assistance  The tables above reflect emergency financing under the RFI  that was provided by the General Department to members  facing urgent balance of payment s needs as a result of the  economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Credit  outstanding by member is presented in Schedule 1.  Following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the access  limits for RFI purchases were temporarily increased (see  Note 4.2.1).  5.1.2  Impairment analysis  The General Department has performed an impairment  analysis of credit outstanding  in accordance with its ECL  model (see Note 3.2.1.1). Based on this analysis, no loss  allowance was deemed to be necessary at April 30, 2022,  and 2021. As described in Note 3.2.1.1, the impairment analysis of the General Depa rtment’s credit outstanding  takes into account the unique  nature of the IMF’s financing  and its institutional status, and is performed holistically for  each debtor member based on  qualitative an d quantitative  considerations and taking into account relevant current developments, including the geopolitical and global economic developments as described in Note 1.5. In this context, the  results of the impairment ana lysis at April 30, 2022, and  2021, are not materially sensitive to reasonable changes in  input parameters of the ECL calculation.  5.2  Overdue obligations  At April 30, 2022, no member was six months or more overdue in settling its financial obligations to the General  Department (one member—Sudan—was six months or more  overdue in settling its financial obligations to the General Department at April 30, 2021).   On June 29, 2021, Sudan settled all of its overdue  obligations to the General Department, including GRA credit outstanding and overdue char ges of SDR 142 million and  SDR 738 million, respectively . Settlement of the overdue  charges generated burden-sharing refunds to members totaling SDR 611 million that had been previously collected  through burden-sharing adjustments to charges and  remuneration (see Notes 13.1, 13.2, 17, and 18).   6.  SDR holdings  The General Department can receive SDRs from members in  the settlement of their financia l obligations to the GRA and  quota subscription payments. In  addition, the GRA may use  or receive SDRs in transactions and operations with members, including the provision of financial assistance to  members, the receipt of charges and fees, and the payment of remuneration on reserve tranche positions or interest on  borrowings to member countries and lenders.  At April 30, 2022, and 2021, the SDR holdings of the General  Department amounted to SDR 22,270 million and  SDR 22,203 million, respectively.  The GRA earns interest on its SDR holdings at the same rate  as other holders of SDRs. Interest on SDR holdings during  the financial years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021, amounted to SDR 25 million and SDR 17 million,  respectively.  7.

General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021     27 During the financial year ended April 30, 2022,  SDR 2,393 million was transferred from the GRA to the IA, as  approved by the Executiv e Board (SDR 319 million  transferred from the IA to the GRA during the financial year  ended April 30, 2021).  On January 12, 2022, the Executive Board reviewed the  strategy of the Investm ent Account and approved  refinements to the investment strategies of the Fixed-Income Subaccount and the Endowment Subaccount, as reflected in Notes 1.2, 4.3.1, 4. 3.2, 7.1, and 7.2. Im plementation of these  changes has been initiated, but will be completed during the year ending April 30, 2023.  7.1  Fixed-Income Subaccount   The Fixed-Income Subaccount comprises two tranches, a  shorter-duration Tranche 1 and a longer-duration Tranche 2.  Effective January 12, 2022, the average duration of the  Fixed-Income Subaccount should not exceed three years  (prior to January 12, 2022, the Fixed-Income Subaccount  had an average duration limit of two and a half years with  Tranche 1 managed against a zero- to three-year  government bond benchmark index and Tranche 2 against a zero- to five-year government bond benchmark index).  Tranche 1 is managed actively, while Tranche 2 is managed  according to a buy-and-hold investment approach, which in limited circumstances allows for the sale of investments in  accordance with the overall in vestment strategy prior to  maturity. Tranche 2 was phased in over a five-year period, which concluded in 2021. Prior to completion, assets pending  investment in Tranche 2 were placed in fixed term deposits.  Both tranches can be invested in debt obligations issued by  national governments of member s, their central banks and  official agencies, international financial institutions, and obligations of the BIS, denomi nated in SDRs or currencies  included in the SDR basket, referred to as Group 1 assets for investment management purposes . Eligible investments in  Tranche 1 also include fixed-income securities issued by  subnational governments, corporate bonds,  mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, and cash instruments with maturities  of one year or less, referred  to as Group 2 assets for investment management purposes. Assets are being invested by external managers, except for investments with the BIS and short-term investments  (residual cash balances). Effective January 12, 2022, Group 2 assets should not exceed 40 percent of the Fixed-Income  Subaccount portfolio (35 percent before January 12, 2022).         Investments in the Fixed-Income Subaccount were as follows:   April 30, 2022   Tranche 1 Tranche 2 Total    (in millions of SDRs)   At fair value through profit or loss:    International financial institutions  obligations:          Medium-term instruments (BIS)  — — —       Others  528 1,701 2,229  Sovereign bonds 7,199 4,693 11,892  Corporate bonds 3,616 — 3,616  Securitized assets 741 — 741  Short-term investments 214 37 251  Derivative assets  106 — 106  Total at fair value through profit or  loss 12,404 6,431 18,835  At amortized cost:     Fixed-term deposits — — —  Total 12,404 6,431 18,835     April 30, 2021   Tranche 1 Tranche 2 Total   (in millions of SDRs)  At fair value through profit or loss:    International financial institutions  obligations:          Medium-term instruments (BIS)  — 1,806 1,806       Others  439 569 1,008  Sovereign bonds 7,786 1,615 9,401  Corporate bonds 2,757 — 2,757  Securitized assets 616 — 616  Short-term investments 215 14 229  Derivative assets  38 — 38  Total at fair value through profit or  loss 11,851 4,004 15,855  At amortized cost:     Fixed-term deposits — 751 751  Total 11,851 4,755 16,606   I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021    28 Fair values of derivative assets and liabilities in the  Fixed-Income Subaccount at April 30, 2022, were  SDR 106 million and SDR 77 million, respectively  (SDR 38 million and SDR 40 million for derivative assets and liabilities, respectively, at April 30, 2021). Notional values of  derivative instruments were as follows:  7.2  Endowment Subaccount   The assets of the Endowment Subaccount are invested in a  globally diversified portfolio consisting of fixed-income and equity instruments (including REITs), and private  infrastructure debt. Assets are invested by external  managers, except for short-term investments (residual cash balances).   The Endowment Subaccount is invested in accordance with  the strategic asset allocation in  select investment categories  approved by the Executive Board.  Each investment category  is invested to achieve exposure to broad characteristics of the specific asset class.   The refinements to the investm ent strategy approved by the  Executive Board on January 12, 2022, modified the strategic  asset allocation by reorganizing some investment categories  and shifting the allocations between the categories including:  (i) a reduction in the allocation to government bonds; (ii) a reduction in inflation-linked bonds; (iii) a dedicated allocation  to infrastructure equities; and (iv) an increase in REITS.  The strategic asset allocation includes a 5 percent allocation  to private infrastructure debt. The IMF invests in this asset  class through commingled funds and its commitments are  drawn down over time based on notices from the respective  investment managers. At Apr il 30, 2022 and April 30, 2021,  total original commitments amounted to SDR 171 million.  During the financial year ended April 30, 2022, total capital  calls under the commitments totaled SDR 96 million and  distributions amounting to SDR 1 million were paid back to the General Department (SDR 14 million and SDR 1 million  for capital calls and distributions, respectively, during the financial year ended April 30, 2021). Investments in the Endowment Subaccount, all of which are classified as FVPL, consisted of the following investment  categories:   April 30, 2022 April 30, 2021   (in millions of SDRs)   Passively managed portfolio:    Developed market sovereign bonds n/a1 894  Developed market corporate bonds 927 1,005  Emerging market bonds n/a1 274  Global sovereign bonds 971 —  US Treasury Inflation-Protected        Securities 969 1,214  Developed market equities 1,614 1,565  Emerging market equities 643 639  Infrastructure equities 340 —  Real estate investment trusts 676 347  Private infrastructure debt 97 12  Short-term investments 288 184  Total passively managed portfolio  6,525 6,134  Actively managed portfolio:    Fixed-income securities — 143  Equity securities — 134  Short-term investments — 10  Total actively managed portfolio — 287  Derivative assets  58 5  Total 6,583 6,426  1 Following the changes to the investment  strategy approved by the Executive  Board on January 12, 2022, the investment categories of developed market  sovereign bonds and emerging market bonds were restructured into the global sovereign bonds category.     Investment categories comprise funds managed to achieve  exposure to broad characteristics of the specific asset class.  Funds may include holdings in other asset classes. Market  exposure may be achieved throug h derivative instruments,  where necessary and as determined under the IA’s Rules  and Regulations.  Fair values of derivative assets and liabilities in the  Endowment Subaccount at April 30, 2022, were SDR 58 million and SDR 15 million, respectively  (SDR 5 million and SDR 16 million for derivative assets and liabilities, respectively, at April 30, 2021). Notional values of derivative instruments were as follows:  April 30, 2022 April 30, 2021   (in millions of SDRs)   Futures    Long positions 452 465  Short positions 2,038 2,336  Currency forwards 3,258 1,587  Interest rate swaps 633 643  Currency swaps — 718  Options on futures 3 —  Swaptions — 63   April 30, 2022 April 30, 2021   (in millions of SDRs)   Futures    Long positions 16 22  Short positions 9 29  Currency forwards 3,571 2,329  I.

Fair value measurement   Valuation techniques used to value financial instruments  include the following:  Level 1  The fair value of publicly tr aded investments is based on  quoted market prices in an active market for identical assets  without any adjustments (clo sing price for equities and  derivative instruments and bi d price for fixed-income  securities). These investments are included within Level 1 of  the fair value hierarchy.   Level 2 The fair value of equity and fixed-income securities not actively traded is determined on the basis of a compilation of  significant observable market information, such  as recently  executed trades in securities of the issuer or comparable  issuers and yield curves. The assessment also takes into  account the inherent risk and terms and conditions of each security. Given that the significant inputs are observable,  these securities are included wit hin Level 2 of the fair value  hierarchy.   The fair value of over-the-c ounter derivative instruments  (foreign exchange forwards, curr ency/interest rate swaps) not  actively traded is determined using a pricing model that  incorporates foreign exchange spot and forward rates and interest rate curves. Given that  the significant inputs into the  pricing models are market obser vable, these instruments are  included within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.  Level 3  The private infrastructure debt assets classified within Level  3 have significant unobserva ble inputs, as they trade  infrequently or do not trade at all. As observable prices are  not available for these assets, the mark-to-model valuation  technique is used to derive the fair value. Different assumptions or approximations could produce significantly  different valuation estimates.   8.1  Investments   The following tables present the fair value hierarchy used to  determine the fair value of investments in the IA:   April 30, 2022   Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total  (in millions of SDRs)   Recurring fair value measurements    Fixed-Income Subaccount 133 18,702 — 18,835  Endowment Subaccount 3,270 3,216 97 6,583  Total 3,403 21,918 97 25,418     April 30, 2021   Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total  (in millions of SDRs)   Recurring fair value measurements    Fixed-Income Subaccount 194 15,661 — 15,855  Endowment Subaccount 2,707 3,707 12 6,426  Total 2,901 19,368 12 22,281    During the financial year ended April 30, 2022, investments totaling SDR 11 million in the Endowment Subaccount were transferred from Level 1 to Level 2 (there were no transfers  from Level 1 to Level 2 in the Fixed-Income Subaccount).  These investments relate to equity securities where trading was either inactive or quoted prices in the applicable market  were not observable as at April 30, 2022. Quoted prices for  similar securities directly observable in an alternative market  were used for fair value measurement of these securities as  at April 30, 2022. During the financial year ended April 30, 2021, there were no transfers from level 1 to level 2 in both  the Fixed-Income and Endowment Subaccounts.    There were no transfers between levels 2 and 3 of fair value  hierarchy in both the Fixed-Income and Endowment  Subaccounts during the financial years ended April 30, 2022,  and 2021. I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021    30 Fixed-term deposits in the IA are generally of a short-term  nature and are carried at amorti zed cost, which approximates  fair value.  Derivative liabilities at April 30, 2022 comprised  SDR 16 million valued based on quoted market prices  (Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy) and SDR 76 million  valued based on observable market data (Level 2 in the fair  value hierarchy) (SDR 8 million and SDR 48 million for  Level 1 and Level 2, respectively, at April 30, 2021).  8.2  Credit outstanding   The IMF plays a unique role in providing balance of  payments support to member countries. IMF financing  features policy conditions that  require member countries to  implement macroeconomic and structural policies and are an  integral part of IMF financing. These measures aim to help  countries resolve their balanc e of payments problems while  safeguarding IMF resources. The fair value of IMF credit  outstanding cannot be deter mined due to its unique  characteristics, including the debtor’s membership relationship with the IMF, and the absence of a principal or  most advantageous market for IMF credit.   8.3  Other financial assets and liabilities   The carrying value of other financial assets and liabilities that  are classified at AC represents a reasonable estimate of their  fair value at April 30, 2022, and 2021.  9.  Gold holdings   The IMF acquired its gold holdings from quota subscriptions and financial transactions prior to the entry into force of the  Second Amendment of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement  (April 1, 1978). At April 30,  2022, and 2021, the IMF held  gold of 2,814 metric tons, equal to 90.474 million fine troy ounces, at designated depositories. Gold holdings were valued at a historical cost of SDR 3,167 million at April 30,  2022, and 2021, based on a cost of SDR 35 per fine troy ounce.  At April 30, 2022, the market value of the IMF’s holdings of  gold was SDR 128.6 billion (SDR 111.4 billion at  April 30, 2021).   10.  Property, plant and equipment and intangible  assets  Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, net of  depreciation and amortization, amounted to SDR 551 million and SDR 555 million at April 30, 2022, and 2021,  respectively, and consisted of land, buildings, equipment,  furniture, and software.   Land Buildings Other Total   (in millions of SDRs)   Financial year ended April 30, 2022:    Cost          Beginning of the year 95 437 420 952          Additions — 2 46 48          Disposals — — (16) (16)      End of the year 95 439 450 984  Accumulated depreciation and amortization:      Beginning of the year — 175 222 397        Depreciation and amortization — 12 40 52        Disposals — — (16) (16)      End of the year — 187 246 433  Net book value at April 30, 2022 95 252 204 551      Depreciation and amortization expenses of SDR 52 million  and SDR 49 million are included in administrative expenses  for the financial years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively.  11.  Employee benefits  11.1  Overview of the Plans  The IMF has a defined benefit Staff Retirement Plan (SRP) that covers all eligible staff and a Supplemental Retirement  Benefits Plan (SRBP) for a subset of participants of the SRP.  The SRBP provides for the payment of benefits that  otherwise would have been payable had the US qualified  plan benefits and compensation limits not applied. Participants in the SRP and SRBP (the pension plans) are  entitled to unreduced annual pensions beginning at the  normal retirement age of 62 or earlier if certain conditions of  age and service are met. The mandatory retirement age is  Land Buildings Other Total   (in millions of SDRs)  Financial year ended April 30, 2021:    Cost          Beginning of the year 95 436 401 932        Additions — 1 46 47        Disposals — — (27) (27)      End of the year 95 437 420 952  Accumulated depreciation and amortization:      Beginning of the year — 163 212 375        Depreciation and amortization — 12 37 49        Disposals — — (27) (27)      End of the year — 175 222 397  Net book value at April 30, 2021 95 262 198 555 I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021     31 65. The pension plans also provide an option for eligible staff  to receive reduced pension be nefits beginning at the age of  50. The level of pension benefits depends on the participants’ length of service and highest three-year average pensionable gross compensation. Participants may also elect upon  retirement to commute a portion of the lifetime pension  benefits into a lump-sum payment.  On June 3, 2021, the Executiv e Board approved changes to  the SRP and SRBP with an effect ive date of May 1, 2022, to  update the formula for the co mputation of the pensionable  gross compensation. The amount of past service cost  resulting from these changes recognized in the statement of income for the year ended April 30, 2022, amounted to  negative SDR 57 million.   The IMF provides other non-pension long-term benefits,  including medical insurance, life insurance, separation and  repatriation benefits, accrued annual leave, and associated  tax allowances. The IMF has established a separate account, the Retired Staff Benefits Investment Account (RSBIA), to  hold and invest resources set asid e to fund the cost of certain  post-retirement benefits.   In May 2020, the Executive Board approved changes to  separation and repatriation benef its with an effective date of  October 1, 2020. The past servic e cost resulting from these  changes recognized in the stat ement of income for the year  ended April 30, 2021, amounted to SDR 6 million. In April 2022, the Executive Board ap proved changes to medical  benefits covered by the RSBI A with an effective date of  January 1, 2023. The past service cost resulting from these changes recognized in the stat ement of income for the year  ended April 30, 2022 was a gain of SDR 112 million.  The assets in the SRP, SRBP, and RSBIA (collectively, the  Plans) are held separately from  the assets of all other  accounts of the IMF. Also, the net asset position in one of the  Plans cannot be netted with the net liability position in  another Plan. In the event the IMF were to exercise its right  to terminate the Plans, the assets of these plans would be used to satisfy liabilities to par ticipants, retired participants,  and their beneficiaries and other liabilities of the pension plans. Any remaining assets would be returned to the GRA. The GRA meets the costs of administering the Plans, and the  SRP and RSBIA reimburse the GRA for investment-related  costs.   The Executive Board and t he Pension Committee are  responsible for the governance of the Plans. The Executive  Board approves the funding framework and amendments to  the Plans. The Pension Committ ee, consisting of members of  the Executive Board a nd senior staff, super vises and controls  the overall administration of  the SRP and the SRBP. The  Pension Committee also undert akes periodic valuations of the assets and liabilities related to the Plans and advises the  Executive Board on the appropri ate funding framework. It is  supported by an Investment Committee to oversee the investments of the Plans.  11.2  Net assets/liabilities and benefit costs under  retirement benefit plans  The amounts recognized in the statements of financial  position were as follows:   April 30, 2022 April 30,  2021   Pension  benefits Other  employee  benefits Total   Total    (in millions of SDRs)   Defined benefit  obligation (8,610) (1,856) (10,466) (11,425)  Plan assets 9,404 2,310 11,714 11,220  Net assets 794 581 1,375 —  Net liabilities  — (127) (127) (205)    The amounts recognized in the statements of income and  statements of comprehensive income were as follows:   2022 2021   Pension  benefits Other  employee  benefits Total Total    (in millions of SDRs)   Service cost (262) (105) (367) (407)  Past service cost 57 112 169 (6)  Interest expense related to  defined benefit obligation (280) (71) (351) (335)  Interest income related to plan assets 271 65 336 244  Net periodic pension cost  recognized in the statements of income (214) 1 (213) (504)  Remeasurement of defined benefit obligation 1,405 630 2,035 457  Net return on plan assets excluding amounts included in interest income (393) (94) (487) 2,532  Exchange differences (19) (14) (33) 166  Amounts recognized in other comprehensive income 993 522 1,515 3,155  Total gain recognized in  statements of  comprehensive income 779 523 1,302 2,651   I.

The actuarially  determined employer contributions to the pension plans  during the financial year ended April 30, 2022 amounted to 10.66 percent of pensionable gross compensation  (13.06 percent of pensionable gross compensation during the  financial year ended April 30, 2021). Under the IMF’s funding  framework, the budgetary allocations for payments to the  pension plans have been set at 14 percent of pensionable gross compensation. The IMF expects to contribute  SDR 150 million to the Plans during the financial year ending  April 30, 2023.  The expected pension and benefits payments to be paid out  by the Plans over the next five years were as follows at  April 30, 2022:  Financial year  Pension  benefits  Other  employee  benefits Total  (in millions of SDRs)  2023 332 85 417  2024 348 70 418  2025 368 74 442  2026 385 76 461  2027 401 79 480  11.3  Principal actuarial assumptions  The IMF conducts a comprehensive analysis of the principal actuarial assumptions used in calculating the net assets/liabilities under retirement benefit plans every five  years and reviews their applicability on an annual basis. The  most recent five-year analysis was completed in April 2021.   The principal actuarial assumptions used in the actuarial  valuation were as follows:   April 30, 2022  April 30, 2021   (in percent)   Discount rate/expected return on  plan assets 4.18 3.02  Rate of salary increases (average)  3.50  Health care cost trend rate  4.00–6.50 4.00–6.75  Inflation  2.00  Life expectancy: (in years)  Male  89.6 89.5  Female  93.0 92.9    The assumed retirement rate ranges from 5 percent at age  50 to 100 percent at age 65, and the assumed participation  rate for medical benefits upon retirement is 85 percent.  The weighted average dura tion of the defined benefit  obligation was 15.8 years at Ap ril 30, 2022 (19.1 years at  April 30, 2021).   2022 2021   Pension  benefits Other  employee  benefits Total Total   (in millions of SDRs )  Beginning of the year 9,112 2,313 11,425 12,018  Current service cost 262 105 367 407  Past service cost (57) (112) (169) 6  Interest expense 280 71 351 335  Employee contributions 44 — 44 44  Actuarial gain due to  demographic assumptions  changes — (172) (172) (120)  Actuarial gain due to financial  assumptions changes (1,405) (458) (1,863) (337)  Benefits paid (273) (58) (331) (314)  Exchange differences 647 167 814 (614)  End of the year 8,610 1,856 10,466 11,425  I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021     33 The following shows the sensitivit y of the present value of the  defined benefit obligation to changes in actuarial  assumptions at April 30, 2022:  Present value  of the defined  benefit obligation Change in  assumption Increase in  assumption Decrease in  assumption  (in millions of SDRs)   Discount rate 0.5% Decrease by 770 Increase by 880  Rate of salary  increases 0.5% Increase by 120 Decrease by 110  Health care cost  trend rate 0.5% Increase by 180 Decrease by 150  Inflation rate 0.5% Increase by 590 Decrease by 530  Life expectancy One year in  longevity Increase by 290     The sensitivity analyses are based on a change in one  assumption, while holding all other assumptions constant, so that the effects of correlati on between the assumptions are  excluded.  12.

Burden-sharing and the Special Contingent  Account  13.1  Burden-sharing for deferred charges   The IMF has adopted a burden-sharing mechanism to  address the financial consequences of member countries’  failure to settle financial obligations to the GRA on time.  Under the burden-sharing mechanism, resources are generated by increasing the rate of charge paid by borrowers  and reducing the rate of remuneration paid to creditor  members to cover shortfalls in the GRA’s income due to the  nonpayment of charges.   Members that participated in  burden-sharing for overdue  charges receive refunds to the extent that t hese charges are  subsequently settled by the defaulting member. During the financial year ended April 30, 2022, the General  Department refunded the full amount of remaining burden- sharing adjustments amounting to SDR 611 million resulting  from the settlement of all outstanding overdue GRA charges  previously deferred (see Note 5.2). There were no deferred charges at April 30, 2022.  There were no burden-sharing refunds during the financial  year ended April 30, 2021. Overdue charges that resulted in  adjustments to charges and remuneration for the year ended  April 30, 2021, amounted to SDR 2 million (see Note 17). Cumulative overdue charges that resulted in adjustments to  charges and remuneration since May 1, 1986 (the date the  burden-sharing mechanism was adopted) amounted to SDR 2,051 million at April 30, 2021. The cumulative refunds  for the same period, resulting from the settlements of  overdue charges for which burden-sharing adjustments had  been made, amounted to SDR 1,440 million at  April 30, 2021.   13.2  Burden-sharing for the SCA-1  The burden-sharing mechanism has also financed additions  to the SCA-1, which offers protection against the risk of loss  resulting from the ultimate failure of a member to repay its overdue obligations to the GRA.   Contributions to the SCA-1 are to be returned when there are  no outstanding overdue repurchases and charges, or at such earlier time as the Executive Board may decide.  During the financial year ended April 30, 2022, in connection  with the clearance of Sudan’ s arrears to the IMF, the  Executive Board decided to make a distribution of the remaining SDR 1,066 million in the SCA-1 to contributing members. The distribution took place on June 29, 2021, and  the SCA-1 balance amounted to zero at April 30, 2022  (SDR 1,066 million at April 30, 2021). I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021    34 Effective November 1, 2006, t he Executive Board decided to  suspend, for the time being, further additions to the SCA-1.  Accordingly, no additions have been made to the SCA-1  during the financial years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021.   14.  Borrowings  The GRA can borrow to temporarily supplement its quota  resources. The Executive Boar d has established guidelines  on borrowing by the GRA to ensur e that the financing of the  GRA is managed in a prudent and systemic manner.   The GRA’s main standing borrowing arrangement is the  NAB. The GRA may also borrow under bilateral agreements, in particular loan and note purchase agreements (bilateral  borrowing agreements). At April 30, 2022, the NAB credit  arrangements amounted to SDR 360.8 billion and the bilateral borrowing agreements amounted to  SDR 138.1 billion; see Schedules 4 and 5, respectively.  14.1  New Arrangements to Borrow   The NAB is a standing set of credit arrangements with 40 participants, of which 38 ag reements were effective at  April 30, 2022, and 2021. The NAB provides supplementary  resources to the GRA as a second line of defense to IMF  quotas.   NAB periods are renewed periodically. In January 2020, the  Executive Board approved a NAB reform that doubled NAB  commitments and set a new NAB period through end 2025.  NAB participants have since provided the necessary consents and this reform took effect as targeted on January  1, 2021. Following the effect iveness of the reform, the  effective NAB commitments amounted to 360.8 billion at April 30, 2022, and 2021.  NAB resources can be activated when the Fund’s resources  need to be supplemented in order to forestall or cope with an  impairment of the internat ional monetary system. The  activation requires the consent of participants representing  85 percent of total NAB credit  arrangements of participants  eligible to vote and the approval  of the Executive Board. The  NAB was not activated at April 30, 2022, and 2021.  Drawings under the NAB can be made to finance purchases  by borrowing members for outright purchases and under  arrangements that were approved during the period when the NAB was activated. Claims under the NAB are encashable  on demand by participants, subject to certain conditions.  14.2  Bilateral Borrowing Agreements   Bilateral borrowing agreements are intended to serve as a third line of defense to IMF quotas and NAB resources. The  current round of bilateral borrowing agreements, which have been in effect since January 1, 2021, were signed under a framework established by the Executive Board in 2020. They  have an initial term through end-December 2023, which may  be extended by one more year, subject to creditor consent.   At April 30, 2022, lenders’  commitments under effective  borrowing agreements totaled US$185.6 billion, equivalent to  SDR 138.1 billion (US$193.9 billion equivalent to  SDR 135.0 billion at April 30, 2021).   Resources under bilateral borrowing agreements can be  activated only if the amount  of IMF resources otherwise  available for financing has fallen below a threshold of SDR 100 billion and either the NAB is activated or there are no available uncommitted NAB resources. Activation requires  approval by bilateral creditors r epresenting 85 percent of the  total credit amount committed.   Drawings under the borrowing agreements may be made to  finance purchases by borrowing members for outright  purchases and under arrangements that were approved during the period when the borrowing agreements were  activated. Claims under the bilateral borrowing agreements  are encashable on demand by lenders, subject to certain conditions.  14.3  Outstanding borrowings  Outstanding borrowings represent  drawings under the NAB,  are denominated in SDRs, and carry the SDR interest rate. There were no outstanding borrowings under bilateral  borrowing agreements at April 30, 2022, and 2021.  There were no drawings under the NAB or bilateral  borrowings during the financial years ended April 30, 2022,  and 2021. Repayments under the NAB during the same periods amounted to SDR 2,523 million and  SDR 3,765 million, respectively. Total outstanding NAB  borrowings at April 30, 2022, and 2021, were SDR 2,615  million and SDR 5,138 million, respectively (see Schedule 4).   The average interest rate on outstanding borrowings was  0.107 percent per annum and 0.077 percent per annum for  the financial years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021,  respectively.  The interest expense on outstanding borrowings  during the same periods was SDR 4 million and  SDR 6 million, respectively.  15.  Quota subscriptions and reserve tranche  positions  15.1  Quota subscriptions  The IMF’s resources are primarily provided by its members  through the payment of quota subscriptions, which broadly I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021     35 reflect each member’s relative position in the global  economy. Quotas also determine each member’s relative  voting power, its share in SDR allocations, and its access to  IMF resources.   The IMF conducts a general review of members’ quotas at  intervals of not more than five years. The review allows the  IMF to assess the adequacy of quota resources to meet its  needs and to allow for adjustments to members’ quotas to  reflect their relative positions in the world economy.   The Fourteenth General Review of Quotas became effective  in January 2016. At April 30, 2022, 187 members had  consented and paid in full their quota increases, amounting to SDR 238 billion (184 members at April 30, 2021,  amounting to SDR 238 billion) . This amount represents over  99 percent of the total quota increases that members were  eligible for at January 26, 2016 (SDR 239 billion). Quota subscription payments under the Fourteenth General Review  of Quotas during the years e nded April 30, 2022, and 2021,  amounted to SDR 0.5 billion and SDR 2 million, respectively.  The Fifteenth General Review of  Quotas was concluded in  February 2020 with no increase in IMF quotas. The Sixteenth  Review is planned to be concluded no later than  December 15, 2023.  On October 16, 2020, the Princi pality of Andorra became the  190 th member of the IMF wit h an initial quota of  SDR 83 million, which was paid in full during the financial  year ended April 30, 2021.  15.2  Reserve tranche positions  The reserve tranche is determined as the difference between the member’s quota subscription and the GRA’s holdings of its currency, excluding holdings that reflect the member’s use  of GRA credit and administrative balances. A member’s  reserve tranche is also considered a part of its international  reserves and a liquid claim against the GRA that can be  encashed by the member at any time upon the representation of a balance of payments need.    Members’ reserve tranche positions were as follows:    April 30, 2022 April 30, 2021   (in millions of SDRs )  Quota subscriptions 476,272 475,808  Total currency holdings 454,718 458,656  Less: GRA credit outstanding (93,031) (89,788)  Less: administrative balances (161) (167)   361,526 368,701  Reserve tranche positions 114,746 107,107  16.  Reserves of the General Resources Account  16.1  Reserves of the General Resources Account  The GRA reserves consist of the Special Reserve and the  General Reserve. The General Reserve may be used inter  alia to meet capital losses and operational deficits or for  distribution to IMF members. The Special Reserve can be  used for the same purposes except distribution to members. At April 30, 2022, the balanc es of Special and General  Reserves amounted to SDR 13,692 million and SDR 12,832 million, respectively (SDR 11,347 million and SDR 12,003 million, respectively, at April 30, 2021).   16.2  Income disposition  The Executive Board determines annually what part of the GRA net income (as described below) will be placed to the General Reserve and/or the Special Reserve, and what part,  if any, will be distributed. Net losses are charged against the  Special Reserve in accordance with an Executive Board  decision.   The GRA net income/losses for the purpose of the income  disposition includes: (i) total income of the GRA; (ii) transfer  from the IA as approved by the Executive Board; and (iii) the  remeasurement of net assets/ liabilities under retirement  benefit plans. For the financia l years ended April 30, 2022,  and 2021, the Executive Board decided to place income to/charge losses against reserves as follows:   Special Reserve  General Reserve    Income Remea- surement Total Income Remea- suremen tTotal    (in millions of SDRs)  Balance at      April 30, 2021 10,842 505 11,347 10, 983 1,020 12,003  Income of the  GRA 830 — 830 829 — 829  Transfer from the IA — — — — — —  Remeasurement of net assets/liabilities  under retirement  benefit plans — 1,515 1,515 — — —  Balance at    April 30, 2022 11,672 2,020 13,692 11,812 1,020 12,832   I.

Charges and fees   The average credit outstanding subject to charges amounted  to SDR 90,522 million and SDR 86,700 million for the financial years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively.   The rate of charge levied on outstanding credit is equal to the  basic rate of charge adjusted for burden-sharing (see  Note 13). The basic rate of charge is the SDR interest rate  plus a fixed margin as determined by the Executive Board, which for the years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021,  amounted to 100 basis points. The average rate of charge  (adjusted for burden-sharing) was 1.107 percent per annum  and 1.077 percent per annum for the financial years ended  April 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively.  Credit outstanding in excess of 187.5 percent of quota  resulting from purchases in the credit tranches and under the  EFF and the SLL is subject to a level-based surcharge of  200 basis points per annum above the basic rate of charge.  An additional time-based surcharge of 100 basis points per  annum applies to such credit outstanding for more than three years, except for purchases under the EFF, for which the  additional surcharge of 100 basis points applies after 51 months. Purchases under the SLL are not subject to time-based surcharges given the short maturity of repurchase  obligations.  Charges income consisted of the following:    During the year ended April 30, 2022, the IMF did not have  overdue charges to defer. The deferred charges during the  year ended April 30, 2021, amounted to SDR 2 million (see  Note 13.1) and were fully recovered through the proceeds from burden-sharing adjustments to charges and  remuneration of SDR 1 million each (see also Note 18).   Other charges and fees cons isted of the following:   2022  2021   (in millions of SDRs)  Service charges  71 115  Commitment fee 283 70  Special charges 88 —  Total charges  442 185    A service charge of 50 basis points is levied by the GRA on  all purchases from the GRA, except for purchases under SLL arrangements, which are subject to a service charge of  21 basis points, and reserve tranche purchases, which are  not subject to service charges.   A commitment fee is levied on the amount available for  financing under an arrangement for each 12-month period  and refunded as the member makes purchases under the  arrangement. Except for SLL arrangements, the commitment  fee amounts to 15 basis points per annum for access up to 115 percent of quota, 30 basis points for access between  115 and 575 percent of quota, and 60 basis points for access  in excess of 575 percent of quota. For SLL arrangements,  the commitment fee amounts to 8 basis points and is not  refundable when the member makes purchases under the  arrangement. At the expiration or cancellation of a GRA arrangement any unrefunded amount is recognized as  income, except for SLL arrangements for which commitment  fee income is recognized on a straight-line basis during the  duration of the arrangement.  The GRA levies special charges on overdue repurchases  and charges of less than six mont hs’ duration. Currently, the  special rate of charge on overdue repurchases is set at zero and for overdue charges it is equal to the SDR interest rate. Such charges are deferred when not paid and recognized as  2022  2021   (in millions of SDRs)  Basic charges before burden-sharing adjustment  1,043 930  Deferred basic charges recovered through:    Burden-sharing adjustment to charges — 1  Burden-sharing adjustment to remuneration  — 1  Surcharges  1,234 931  Total charges  2,277 1,863",6

Financial Statements of the General Department    PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, 655 New York Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20001   T: (202) 414 1000, www.pwc.com/us       Report of Independent Auditors     To the  Board of Governors of the International Monetary Fund     Opinion     We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the General Department of the International  Monetary Fund (the “Department”), which comprise the  statements of financial position as of April 30,  2022 and 2021, and the related statements of income, of comprehensive income, of changes in reserves,  retained earnings, and resources, and of cash flows for the years then ended , including the related notes  (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”).     In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial  position of the Department as of April 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash  flows for the years then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued  by the International Accounting Standards Board.     Basis for Opinion     We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of  America (US GAAS) and in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our  responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibil ities for the Audit  of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of the International  Monetary Fund, and have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant  ethical requirements relatin g to our audit,  which include relevant ethical requirements in the United  States of America and the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for  Professional Accountants . We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and  appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.     Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial  Statements     Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the fina ncial statements in  accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting  Standards Board, and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the  preparation and fair presenta tion of financial statements that are free from material misstatement,  whether due to fraud or error.     In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Department’s ability to  continue as a going concern for at least, but not limited to, twelve months from the end of the reporting  period , disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of  accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Department or to cease operati ons, or has  no realistic alternative but to do so.           Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Department’s financial reporting  process.     Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements       Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are  free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that  includes our opinion . Reasonable assurance is a high l evel of assurance but is not absolute assurance and  therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with US GAAS and ISAs  will always  detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement result ing  from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional  omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material  if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment  made by a reasonable user based on the financial statements.     In performing an audit in accordance with US GAAS and ISAs we:    ● Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.   ● Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to  fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such  procedures include exam ining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in  the financial statements.   ● Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit  procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for  the purpose of expressing an  opinion on the effectiveness of the Department’s internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is  expressed.    ● Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant  accounting estimate s made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the  financial statements.   ● Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate,  that raise substantial doubt about the Department’s ability to c ontinue as a going concern for a  reasonable period of time.     We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the  planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal contr ol-related  matters that we identified during the audit.    Supplemental Information     Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the financial statements taken as a  whole. The accompanying supplemental schedules appearing on pages 40 to 48 as of April 30, 2022 and  for the years ended April 30, 2022 and 2021 (collectively referred to as the “supplemental schedules”) are  presented for purposes of additional analysis and are not a required part of the financial statements. The  supplemental s chedules are the responsibility of management and were derived from and relate directly to  the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the financial statements. The information  has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the au dit of the financial statements and certain  additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying  accounting and other records used to prepare the financial statements or to the financial statements     themselv es and other additional procedures, in accordance with US GAAS. We also subjected the  information to the applicable procedures required by ISAs. In our opinion, the supplemental schedules are  fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the fina ncial statements taken as a whole.         June 24, 2022       I.

Nature of operations  The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is an international  organization with 190 member countries. The IMF’s  fundamental mission is to en sure the stability of the  international monetary system. It does so in three ways:  surveillance of the global economy and the economies of  member countries; lending to  countries with balance of  payments difficulties; and giving practical help by providing technical assistance to members. It is headquartered in Washington, DC, USA.   The IMF conducts its operations and transactions through the  General Department. The General Department comprises three accounts: (i) the General  Resources Account (GRA);  (ii) the Investment Account (IA); and (iii) the Special Disbursement Account (SDA).  1.1  General Resources Account  The financial operations of the IMF with its members are  primarily conducted through the GRA. The assets and liabilities in the GRA reflect the payment of member quota  subscriptions, use and repayment of GRA credit, borrowings  and repayments to lenders, collection of charges from borrowers, payment of remuneration on creditor positions  and interest to lenders, and other operations.  A core responsibility of the IMF is to provide financial  assistance to member countries experiencing actual or  potential balance of payments pr oblems. Upon the request of  a member country, GRA resources are made available either  under a financing arrangement or in the form of outright  purchases (disbursements). An arrangement is a decision by  the IMF’s Executive Board (Executive Board) that gives a  member the assurance that the IMF stands ready to provide  resources to the member during a specified period and up to a specified amount, in accordance with the terms of the  relevant financing instrument.   The Stand-By Arrangement (SBA)  is designed for members  with balance of payments problems expected to be resolved  in the short to medium term. The Extended Fund Facility  (EFF) is a special facility in the GRA for members with longer-term balance of payments problems, the resolution of  which would require structural and more comprehensive  economic reforms. Resources under the SBA and the EFF are made available in phased installments as the member  implements economic policies and measures specified under the arrangement, subject to periodic reviews by the  Executive Board.  The Flexible Credit Line (FCL) is available for members with  very strong fundamentals, policies, and track records of  policy implementation and is intended for both crisis prevention and resolution. The Short-term Liquidity Line  (SLL) is designed to provide liquidity support and has several  innovative features, including revolving access. It has the  same qualification criteria as the FCL but is available only for  members facing potential moderate short-term balance of  payments needs arising due to capital account pressures.  The Precautionary and Liquidity Line (PLL) is available for  members with sound economic fundamentals but with some remaining vulnerabilities that pr eclude them from meeting the  qualification criteria for the FCL and the SLL.   The financing instrument for outright purchases is the Rapid  Financing Instrument (RFI), which is used by members facing  an urgent balance of payments need without the necessity or  capacity for a full-fledged program.  1.2  Investment Account  The IA holds resources transferred from the GRA, which are  invested to broaden the IMF’s income base. The Rules and Regulations of the IA adopted  by the Executive Board  provide the framework for the implementation of the expanded investment authorit y authorized under the Fifth  Amendment of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, which  became effective in February 2011. The IA comprises two  subaccounts: the Fixed-Income Subaccount and the Endowment Subaccount.   The Fixed-Income Subaccount holds resources transferred  from the GRA that are not relat ed to profits from gold sales.  With a view to generating income while protecting the IMF’s  balance sheet, the investment objective of the Fixed-Income  Subaccount is to produce returns in Special Drawing Rights  (SDRs) terms in excess of the th ree-month SDR interest rate  (see Notes 2.1 and 2.2) over time while minimizing the  frequency and extent of negative returns and  underperformance over an investment horizon of three to  four years. During financial year ended April 30, 2022, the  Executive Board concluded its 5- yearly review of the Fixed- Income Subaccount’s investment strategy and effective January 12, 2022, set the investment objective to achieve, over time, returns that exceed  the SDR interest rate by a  margin of 50 basis points. I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021    12 The Endowment Subaccount was credited with  SDR 4.4 billion in profits fr om gold sales during financial  years 2010 and 2011. The Endowment Subaccount’s investment objective is to achieve a real return of 3 percent in US dollar terms over the long term to contribute to covering  the IMF’s administrative expenditures, while preserving the  long-term real value of these assets.   1.3  Special Disbursement Account  The SDA is the vehicle used to receive profits from the sale of gold held by the IMF at  the time of the Second  Amendment of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement (April 1978).  SDA resources can be used for various purposes, as  specified in the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, including transfers to the GRA for immediate use in operations and  transactions, transfers to the IA, or operations and  transactions that are not authorize d by other provisions of the  IMF’s Articles of Agreement but are consis tent with the  mandate of the IMF, in particular to provide balance of payments assistance on special terms to low-income  member countries.  1.4  Other entities administered by the IMF  The IMF also administers the Special Drawing Rights  Department (SDR Department ), trusts (Concessional  Lending and Debt Relief Trusts), and special purpose accounts (Administered Accounts) established to fund financial and technical services consistent with the IMF’s  purposes. As the General Department does not have control  over these entities, their finan cial statements are presented  separately.  The resources of the SDR Department are held separately  from the assets of all t he other accounts owned or  administered by the IMF. As specified in the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, these resources may not be used to meet the liabilities, obligations, or losses incurred in the operations of  the General Department (or vice versa), except that  expenses of conducting the business of the SDR Department are paid by the General De partment and are then reimbursed  by the SDR Department.   The resources of the trusts and special purpose accounts are  contributed by members, by other  financial institutions, or by  the IMF through the SDA. The a ssets and liabilities of the  trusts and special purpose accounts are separate from the assets and liabilities of the General Department. The assets  of the trusts and special purpose accounts cannot be used to  meet the liabilities, obligations, or losses incurred in the  operations of the General  Department. The General  Department can be reimbursed for the expenses incurred in  conducting the business of certain trusts and accounts in  accordance with the IMF’s Articles of Agreement and  relevant decisions of the Executive Board. 1.5  Impact of geopolitical and global economic  developments  The COVID-19 pandemic has cr eated severe disruptions in  global economic activity. The IMF responded to the crisis  with unprecedented speed and  magnitude of financial  assistance, to help countries, notably to protect the most vulnerable and set the stage for economic recovery. A significant number of countri es benefited from emergency  financing through RFI purchases during the financial year ended April 30, 2021 (see Note 5.1). The IMF has also approved financial assistance under its lending arrangements  and augmented existing lending arrangements to  accommodate new needs arising from the impact of the pandemic during the financial years ended April 30, 2022,  and 2021 (see Schedule 3). As a result of this increased  financing activity, the General Department’s credit exposure has increased compared with the pre-pandemic level.  The evolution of the pandemic is  still subject to significant  uncertainty. Beyond April 30, 2022, slowing global growth  and elevated debt vulnerabilities could lead to further  demand for lending arrangements in the coming months. The war in Ukraine that started in February 2022 is expected to  have a significant negative effect on global growth through  commodity markets, trade, and, to a lesser extent, financial interlinkages. Economic and financial spillovers from the war  could also trigger additional demand for Fund financing.   The General Department continues to manage its risks in  accordance with its existing risk management framework  (see Note 4). As of the date of  these financial statements,  there had been no negative impact on the operational results of the General Department, in cluding from the impairment  analysis of its credit portfolio (see Note 5.1). See also Note  2.3 for the most significant estimates and judgements used in  the preparation of thes e financial statements.  The risk management practices described in Note 4.3 have  effectively mitigated the risk exposure of the effects of the  global developments on the investment portfolios. The  valuations of mark-to-market  financial instruments had fully  and rapidly recovered after a brief decline in value at the  onset of the pandemic. However,  in light of the war in  Ukraine, tightening monetary c onditions coupled with a sharp  increase in inflation and inflat ion expectations, the investment  portfolios remain subject to challenging market conditions  and high volatility. The effects of the global developments on  investments are also reflected in the value at risk (VaR) (see  Note 4.3.2.3). The valuation of  investments held at amortized  cost was not impacted. I.

Basis of preparation and measurement  The financial statements of t he General Department are  prepared in accordance with International Financial  Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International  Accounting Standards B oard (IASB). The financial  statements have been prepared under the historical cost  convention, except for the revalu ation of financial instruments  at fair value through profit or  loss. The financial statements  have also been prepared on t he basis that the General  Department will continue to op erate as a going concern.  2.1  Unit of account  The financial statements are presented in SDRs, which is the  IMF’s unit of account. The value of the SDR is determined  daily by the IMF by summing specific amounts of the basket  currencies in US dollar equivalents on the basis of market exchange rates. The IMF generally reviews the composition  of the SDR valuation basket at  five-year intervals. These  reviews cover the currencies to be included in the SDR valuation basket (along with the criteria for the selection of  currencies), determine the relative weights of those  currencies, and assess the fi nancial instruments that are  used to calculate the SDR interest rate. The current basket consists of five currencies. The weights and amounts of the  currencies in the basket, at April 30, 2022, and April 30,  2021, relative to 1 SDR, were as follows:  SDR basket curren cy Weight (in percent) Amount  Chinese renminbi 10.92 1.0174  Euro 30.93 0.38671  Japanese yen 8.33 11.900  Pound sterling 8.09 0.085946  US dollar  41.73 0.58252    At April 30, 2022, SDR 1 was equal to US$1.34430  (US$1.43599 at April 30, 2021).  The current SDR valuation basket was originally scheduled  to expire on September 30, 2021. However, the Executive  Board decided to extend it to July 31, 2022.  On May 11, 2022, the Exec utive Board concluded the  quinquennial review of the me thod of valuation of the SDR  and agreed to maintain the curr ent composition of the SDR  currency and interest rate baskets and approved their  updated weights. The updated basket implies slightly higher weights for the US dollar and the Chinese renminbi and,  accordingly, somewhat lower we ights for the British pound,  the euro, and the Japanese yen.   Effective August 1, 2022, t he SDR basket valuation basket  will be assigned the following weights:  SDR basket currency Weight (in percent)  Chinese renminbi 12.28  Euro 29.31  Japanese yen 7.59  Pound sterling 7.44  US dollar  43.38    The amounts of each of the five  currencies will be calculated  on July 29, 2022 (the transition date) in accordance with the  new weights. The next review of the method of valuation of  the SDR will take place in 2027, unless developments in the  interim justify an earlier review.   2.2  SDR interest rate  The SDR interest rate provides the basis for basic charges  levied on credit outstanding (see Note 17), interest on SDR  holdings (see Note 6), remuneration paid on members’  reserve tranche positions (see Note 18), and interest on  borrowings (see Note 14).   The SDR interest rate is determined weekly by reference to a  weighted average of yields or rates on short-term instruments  in the money markets of the members whose currencies are  included in the SDR valuation basket:   SDR basket currency Yield or rate  Chinese renminbi Three-month benchmark yield for China  Treasury bonds as published by the China  Central Depository and Clearing Co., Ltd.  Euro Three-month spot rate for euro area central  government bonds with a minimum rating of  AA published by the European Central  Bank  Japanese yen Three-month Treasury discount bills  Pound sterling Three-month Treasury bills  US dollar Three-month Treasury bills    The SDR interest rate is subject to a floor of 0.050 percent  and is rounded to three decimal places.   The average SDR interest rate was 0.107 percent per annum  and 0.077 percent per annum during the financial years  ended April 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively.  2.3  Use of estimates and judgement  The preparation of financ ial statements requires  management to make judgements, estimates, and assumptions that affect the app lication of accounting policies  and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.  Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an  ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021    14 recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised  and in any future periods affected.  The most significant estimates and judgements used in  applying accounting policies include expected credit losses measurement for credit outstanding and undrawn  commitments (see Notes 3.2.1.1 and 5.1), fair value  measurement of financial inst ruments (see Notes 3.10 and  8), and actuarial assumptions used in calculating the net assets/liabilities under retirement benefit plans (see Note 11.3).  3.  Summary of significant accounting policies  3.1  Financial instruments   Financial instruments include financial assets and financial liabilities described in Notes 3.2 and 3.7.  Measurement at initial recognition  Financial instruments are recognized when the General Department becomes a party to the contractual provisions of  the instrument. The General Department uses settlement  date accounting for all financial instruments except for  investments, which are accounted for using trade date  accounting (see Note 3.2.3). At initial recognition, a financial instrument is measured at it s fair value, which is best  evidenced by the transaction amount.   Derecognition Financial assets, or a portion thereof, are derecognized when  the contractual rights to rece ive the cash flows from the  assets have expired, or when they have been transferred and  either: (i) the General Department  transfers substantially all  the risks and rewards of owners hip; or (ii) the General  Department neither transfers nor retains substantially all the  risks and rewards of ownership but the General Department  has not retained control.   Financial liabilities are derecognized when they are  extinguished (i.e., when the obligation is discharged,  canceled, or expires).   Classification and subsequent measurement of  financial assets  A financial asset is classified on initial recognition based on two factors: the business model for managing the financial  asset and its contractual cash flow characteristics.   Financial assets that are held for collection of contractual  cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and intere st are measured at amortized  cost (AC). Interest income fr om these financial assets is  included in the statements of  income using the effective interest method. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is  recognized in the statements of income.   Financial assets that are held for collection of contractual  cash flows and for selling, where the assets’ cash flows  represent solely payments of principal and interest, would be  measured at fair value through other comprehensive income  (FVOCI). The General Departm ent did not have financial  assets at FVOCI during the financial years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021.  All other financial assets that do not meet the criteria to be  measured at AC or FVOCI are measured at fair value, with  changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss (FVPL).  Impairment  At each reporting date, the General Department assesses on  a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses (ECL)  associated with its financial assets at AC and with the  undrawn balances under its lending commitments. The  measurement of ECL reflects: (i) an unbiased and probability-weighted amou nt that is determined by evaluating  a range of possible outcomes; (ii) the time value of money; and (iii) reasonable and suppor table information that is  available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date about past events, current conditions, and forecasts of future economic conditions.   If the General Department neede d to recognize ECL, they  would be recorded as impairment allowances for assets at AC and as a liability provision for undrawn commitments.   Should any financial asset become credit-impaired, interest  income would be calculated for it by applying the effective interest rate to its amortized co st (i.e., net of the impairment  allowance).  Classification and subsequent measurement of  financial liabilities  Derivative financial liabilities are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss.   All other financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost. Interest expense from these financial liabilities is included in the statements of income using t he effective interest method.   3.2  Financial assets  3.2.1  Currencies  Currencies are financial assets that consist of members’  currencies held by the GRA with designated depositories, in  the form of account balances or non-interest-bearing  promissory notes that ar e encashable by the GRA on  demand. All currencies in the GRA are classified at AC. I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021     15  Usable currencies are currencies of members considered  to be in a sufficiently strong external position that they can  be used to finance GRA transactions with other members.    Currencies of members that are not considered to have a  sufficiently strong balance of payments and reserves  position to finance GRA transactions with other members are presented as other currencies.    Holdings of member currencies that represent purchases of usable currencies or SDRs in exchange for their own  currencies are presented as credit outstanding (see Note  3.2.1.1).   The currency balances in the statements of financial position include receivables and payables arising from currency  revaluations (see Note 5).  3.2.1.1  Credit outstanding and charges  Credit outstanding is a financial asset that represents  financing provided to members under the various GRA financing facilities (see Note 1.1). Members receive financing  in the GRA by purchasing SDRs or usable currencies in  exchange for their own currencies. GRA credit is repaid by  members by repurchasing holdings of their currencies in  exchange for SDRs or usable currencies.   Charges and fees  The GRA earns interest, referred to as basic charges, on  members’ use of GRA credit (see Note 17). Basic charges are recognized using the e ffective interest method.    In addition to basic charges, outstanding GRA credit is also subject to level-based and time-based surcharges (see Note 17). Surcharges are recognized when the relevant  level-based and time-based thresholds on credit outstanding  set by the Executive Board are reached.   Charges not received from members within the required  timeframe are recovered by the GRA under the burden- sharing mechanism, through adjustments to increase the rate  of charge for debtor member s and decrease the rate of  remuneration on members’ reserve tranche positions (see  Note 13.1).   A service charge is levied by the GRA on all purchases from  the GRA except reserve tranche purchases. Service charges are paid when the purchases are made and are recognized  as income upon payment.   A commitment fee is levied on the amount available for  financing under an arrangement for each 12-month period of  the arrangement. Except for SLL arrangements, commitment  fees are refunded as the member makes purchases under  the relevant arrangement. A prorated commitment fee is also  refunded for all arrangements in case of an arrangement’s cancellation. At the arrangement’s expiration or cancellation, any unrefunded amount is recognized as income. Pending refund or recognition as income, commitment fees are  recognized as part of other li abilities in the statements of  financial position. For SLL arrangements, the commitment  fee is nonrefundable upon purchases. Accordingly,  commitment fee income is recognized on a straight-line basis  over the duration of the SLL arrangement.  Impairment of credit outstanding The General Department’s assessment for impairment of its credit outstanding is grounded in  the context of the nature of  the IMF’s financing and its un ique institutional status:     The IMF has a unique relationship with its member countries, all of which are shar eholders in the institution.    IMF financing under arrangements is linked to regular reviews of performance under a program of economic  policies that the member commits to in order to overcome  balance of payments problems, return to external viability, and repay the IMF.    The IMF employs a comprehensive set of measures to mitigate credit risk (see Note 4.2.1).   The IMF also has de facto pref erred creditor status, which  has been recognized by the official community and generally accepted by private creditors.  Taken together, these factor s significantly reduce the  likelihood of the General Department incurring credit losses.   The General Department has not recognized any impairment  losses since inception. Also, unlik e large financial institutions  in the private sector, the General Department’s credit portfolio consists of a relatively small number of exposures to  its member countries, with eac h member’s circumstances  varying. Therefore, a stat istical approach to credit risk  assessment, such as probability of default (PD) and loss given default (LGD) modeling, as typically followed in the financial sector is neither feasible nor appropriate for the  General Department.   Similarly, the assessment of t he General Department’s credit  risk cannot rely on external credit risk ratings. Due to its  unique characteristics, the IMF’ s credit risk exposure is not  comparable to sovereign credit risk faced by commercial  financial entities and, as a cooperative member organization,  the IMF does not produce its own internal credit rating  grades. Accordingly, credit risk for the General Department is  assessed holistically based on  qualitative an d quantitative  considerations pertaining to each debtor member, such as  the status of the economic programs underlying IMF  financing, the member’s cooperation on policy  implementation and timely settlement of IMF financial obligations, and forward-looking assessment of the member’s  capacity to repay. I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021    16 The General Department has developed a model for ECL  estimation based on changes in credit quality since initial  recognition, where credit qualit y is referred to as Stage 1,  Stage 2, and Stage 3. Credit out standing for which credit risk  has increased significantly since initial recognition (Stage 2), or that is credit-impaired (S tage 3), has its ECL measured on  a lifetime basis. Credit outstan ding for which there has been  no significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition  (Stage 1) has its ECL measured as a portion of lifetime ECL  that result from default events possible within the next  12 months.  The key judgements and assumptions adopted by the  General Department in t he measurement of ECL are  discussed below :  (i) Definition of defaul t and credit-impaired   The General Department considers a member country to be  in default when it is six months or more overdue in settling its  financial obligations to the General Department. This rebuts the presumption that  default occurs no later than 90 days  past due, reflecting the nature of the IMF’s financing and its unique institutional status as well as consistency with the  threshold for internal risk management purposes. Credit outstanding is considered cred it-impaired when the obligation  has defaulted.   (ii) Significant increase in credit risk  The General Department assesses whether a significant increase in credit risk has occurred on a member-by-member  basis by comparing the risk of default at the reporting date  with the risk of default at t he date of the most recent  disbursement to the debtor member. The assessment is  performed on each reporting date and takes into account a  range of qualitative and quantitative criteria, including  overdue obligations to the IMF, signals of noncooperation by  the member, and forward-looking indicators of capacity to repay the IMF. The criteria used to identify significant  increases in credit risk are monitored and reviewed for  appropriateness at least annually.   The assessment does not rely on any single factor and may,  on the basis of other relevant considerations, rebut the  presumption that credit risk has increased significantly when contractual payments are mo re than 30 days past due.  During the financial years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021, the General Department did not have any member more than 30 days past due, except for one member in protracted  arrears at April 30, 2021, which were subsequently settled  (see Note 5.2).  (iii) Low credit risk   The General Department assumes that the credit risk of a member country has not increased significantly since initial recognition if the member is determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date, as defined below.   Credit risk related to the General Department’s exposure to a member country is considered low if: (i) it has a low risk of default; (ii) the member country  has a strong capacity to meet  its contractual cash flow obligations in the near term; and (iii) adverse changes in economic and business conditions in  the longer term may, but will not necessarily, reduce the  ability of the member country to fulfill its contractual cash flow  obligations.   (iv) Measuring ECL  ECL are determined by comparing expected cash flows with contractual cash flows and discounting the expected cash  shortfalls at the effective interest  rate, which is the basic rate  of charge. ECL are estima ted by assessing a range of  possible outcomes in light of expected future economic  conditions, weighted according to the assessed probability of  each outcome. This entails considerable judgement and uncertainty about the estimates.   For the purpose of ECL measurement, financial safeguards that are integral to the IMF’s financial structure and  operations are also considered, such as the burden-sharing  mechanism to compensa te the IMF for loss of income due to  overdue payments (see Note  13.1) and the Special  Contingent Account (SCA-1) to pr otect the IMF in case of the  ultimate failure of a member to repay its overdue obligations to the GRA (see Note 13.2).  Write-off  In the unlikely event that a member with credit outstanding (i) withdraws from the IMF; ( ii) repudiates its outstanding  obligations to the General Depar tment; and (iii) there are no  prospects of recovering amounts due to the General  Department in the foreseeable future, the IMF would  recognize the ultimate loss and the withdrawn member’s credit outstanding to the G eneral Department would be  written off.   3.2.2  SDR holdings   SDR holdings represent SDRs held by the GRA (see Note 6).  SDR holdings are measured at AC.  Interest on SDR holdings is recognized using the effective  interest method.   3.2.3  Investments   Investments are financial assets that include equity securities, real estate investment trusts (REITs), private  infrastructure debt, fixed-in come securities, short-term  investments, fixed-term deposits, and derivative assets. Derivative liabilities are disclosed as part of other liabilities in  the statements of fi nancial position.  I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021     17 Investments in each of the tw o subaccounts are managed in  accordance with their respective investment strategy (see  Note 7) and their performance is evaluated on a fair value  basis. The business model for the invested portfolios focuses on achieving fair value gains. Accordingly, these securities  are classified at FVPL. Funds pending suitable investment in  accordance with the investment  strategy may be kept in  fixed-term deposits, which are measured at amortized cost.  Purchases and sales of investments are recognized on the  trade date. The corresponding investment trades receivable  or payable are recognized in other assets and other liabilities,  respectively, pending settlement of a transaction.  Investment income compri ses interest income on  investments at AC, interest and dividend income, and  realized and unrealized gains and losses from FVPL investments, including currency valuation differences arising  from exchange rate movements against the SDR, net of all  trading-related fees.  Interest income from investments is recognized using the  effective interest method. Dividend income is recognized  based on the ex-dividend date.  3.3  Cash and cash equivalents   Usable currencies and SDR holdings are considered cash and cash equivalents in the statements of cash flows.  3.4  Gold holdings  Gold holdings (acquired prior to the Second Amendment of  the IMF’s Articles of Agreement in April 1978) are carried at  historical cost using the spec ific identification method. The  carrying value is determined by the restrictions on the use of  the IMF’s gold holdings and the di sposition of profits from the  sale of gold. In accordance with the provisions of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, whenever the IMF sells gold that was  held on the date of the e ffectiveness of the Second  Amendment of the IMF’s Articles  of Agreement, that portion  of the proceeds equal to the hist orical cost must be placed in  the GRA. Any proceeds in excess of the historical cost will be held in the SDA or transferred to the Endowment Subaccount  of the IA (see Note 9). The IMF may also sell such gold  holdings to those members that were members on August 1, 1975, in exchange for their currencies and at a price equal to  the historical cost.  3.5  Property, plant and equipment and intangible  assets  Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are  measured at historical cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization. Property, plant and equipment and intangible  assets are capitalized and depreciated or amortized over the  estimated remaining useful lives using the straight-line method. Buildings are deprecia ted over 30 years and other  property, plant and equipment over 3 to 20 years. Leasehold  improvements are depreciated ov er the term of the lease  agreement. Software is amortized over three to five years.  3.6  Post-employment benefits  The IMF sponsors various post-employment benefit plans for its employees, which include defined benefit and other  post-employment benefits such as medical and life insurance  benefits (see Note 11).  The net asset/liability under each retirement benefits plan  recognized in the statements of financial position is the  present value of the defined ben efit obligation less the fair  value of the plan assets. Changes resulting from remeasurements are reported in other comprehensive  income. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined using the projecte d unit credit method by  discounting the estimated future cash outflows using market  yields on high-quality corporate bonds.   Net periodic pension cost includes service cost and net  interest cost on the net asse ts/liabilities under retirement  benefit plans.  3.7  Financial liabilities  3.7.1  Special Contingent Account The SCA-1 was used by the General Department to  accumulate precautionary balances under the burden- sharing mechanism (see Note 13.2) against possible credit  default. Balances in the SCA-1 are akin to refundable non-interest-bearing deposits.   3.7.2  Borrowings   Borrowings are financial liabilities that represent financing  received under the various borrowing arrangements  (see Note 14).  Interest expense on borrowings is calculated by applying the  effective interest method.   3.7.3  Quota subscriptions   Members’ quota subscriptions are financial liabilities that  represent subscription payments by members, including  payments as a result of quota increases (see Note 15.1). An increase in quota subscription for an existing member  becomes effective when the member both consents to the  quota increase and makes the actual payment (provided that any other requirements for the effectiveness of the specific  quota increase are met), and the increase is recorded in the financial statements on the payment  date. Typically, about a  quarter of a member’s quota subscription (reserve asset portion) is paid either in SDRs or in the currencies of other members specified by the IMF, or in any combination of I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021    18 SDRs and such currencies; and the remainder is paid in the  member’s own currency.   Quota subscriptions are cla ssified as liabilities in the  statements of financial position, as they embody an  unconditional repayment obligation in the case of a member’s  withdrawal from the IMF.  3.7.3.1  Reserve tranche positions and remuneration  A member acquires a reserve tranche position in the GRA in  exchange for the reserve asset portion of its quota subscription payment, and from the use of the member’s  currency in the GRA’s transactions or operations (see  Note 15.2).   The GRA pays interest, referr ed to as remuneration, on a  remunerated portion of t he member’s reserve tranche  position (see Note 18). Remuneration expense is recognized  on an accrual basis.   3.8  Provisions  Provisions are recognized when the IMF has a current legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is  probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made. Provisions are measured at  the present value of the amoun ts that are expected to be  paid to settle the obligations.  3.9  Foreign currency translation  Transactions denominated in currencies and not in SDRs are  recorded at the rate of exchange on the date of the  transaction. Assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies are reported using the SDR exchange rate on the  date of the financial statements. Exchange differences  arising from the settlement of transactions at rates different  from those at the originating date of the transactions are  included in the determination of net income.  3.10  Fair value measurement  Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between  market participants at the m easurement date. A fair value  measurement is based on th e presumption that the  transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either in the principal market for the asset or liability or, in the absence of a principal market, in the most  advantageous market.  A three-level fair value hierarchy is used to determine fair  value under which financial instruments are categorized  based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique. The fair value hierarchy has the following levels:  When the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset  or liability fall within multiple le vels of the hierarchy, the level  within which the fair value me asurement is categorized is  based on the lowest-level input t hat is significant to the fair  value measurement of the instrument in its entirety. Thus, a  Level 3 fair value measurement may include inputs that are  both observable and unobservable. Transfers in and out of  the fair value hierarchy levels  are recognized at the end of  the reporting period.  The valuation techniques used to determine fair value are  described in Note 8.  3.11  Amendments to existing standards that became  effective in the financial year ended April 30, 2022  Amendments to IFRS 9, “Financial Instruments”, and IFRS 7,  “Financial Instruments: Disclosures” were issued in August 2020 to address financial reporting issues related to the  reform of an interest rate benchmark, including its  replacement with alternative benchmark rates. The  amendments are effective for annual periods starting on or  after January 1, 2021, and were adopted by the General  Department on May 1, 2021. The amendments had no  material effect on the General Department’s financial  statements.  3.12  Amendments to existing standards effective in  future years  The following amendments to existing standards issued by  the IASB will become effective in  future financial years.   Amendments to IFRS 9, “Financial Instruments” were issued in May 2020 to clarify certain aspects of derecognition of financial liabilities. The amendm ents are effective for annual  periods starting on or after January 1, 2022. The amendments will be adopted by t he General Department for  the financial year ending Ap ril 30, 2023, and are not  expected to have a material effect on the General Department’s financial statements.  Amendments to IAS 1, “Pre sentation of Financial  Statements” and IFRS Prac tice Statement 2, “Making  Materiality Judgements” were issued in February 2021 to  help entities apply materiality judgements to accounting  policy disclosures. The amendments are effective for annual Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical  assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the  measurement date;   Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly  (i.e., derived from prices);  Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021     19 periods starting on or after January 1, 2023. The  amendments will be adopted by t he General Department for  the financial year ending Ap ril 30, 2024, and are not  expected to have a material effect on the General Department’s financial statements.  Amendments to IAS 8, “Accounting Policies, Changes in  Accounting Estimates and Errors” were issued in February  2021 to clarify the definition of accounting estimate. The  amendments are effective for annual periods starting on or  after January 1, 2023. The amendments will be adopted by  the General Department for the financial year ending  April 30, 2024, and are not expected to have a material effect on the General Department’ s financial statements.  4.  Financial risk management   The General Department is exposed to various types of  operational and financial risks, including credit, market, and  liquidity risks.  4.1  Risk management framework  By virtue of its role establishe d through the IMF’s Articles of  Agreement, the IMF faces a range of financial and nonfinancial risks. The Executive Board has approved a risk  acceptance statement guiding risk acceptance and  assessment across the IMF’s activities. The IMF has adopted the three lines of defense model for risk management.   Risks inherent in day-to-day o perations are mitigated by  establishing and main taining a system of internal controls.   A risk management function is responsible for developing  and maintaining the risk management framework, fostering the development of  risk management tools, and  reporting on the General Depart ment’s overall risk profile,  highlighting areas where additional mitigation efforts are needed.    An internal audit function is responsible for providing an independent assessment of  the effectiveness of  governance and internal control processes.    Oversight is provided by committees established to monitor  and make decisions in specific risk areas, which supports the  cycle of risk assessment, ownership, and mitigation vis-à-vis risk acceptance.   4.2  Financial assets and liabilities other than  investments  Financial assets and liabilities other than investments are  exposed to credit, market, and liquidity risks. 4.2.1  Credit risk on financial assets and liabilities other than  investments  Credit risk is the risk of suffering financial losses, should any  of the IMF’s members fail to fulfill their financial obligations to the GRA. Credit risk arises on credit outstanding and  undrawn committed amounts under approved financing  commitments.  Credit risk is inherent in the IMF’s unique role in the  international monetary system  because the IMF has limited  ability to diversify its credit portfolio and generally provides  financing when other sources of credit are not available to a  member. In addition, the IMF’s credit concentration is generally high due to the nature of the financial assistance  provided to its member countries.  Measures to help mitigate the IMF’s credit risk in financing  arrangements include program design and conditionality,  which serve to help member countries solve their balance of  payments problems within the period of an IMF-supported program and to provide the ne eded assurances that the  member will be able to repay the IMF. Other risk mitigating policies include access limits, post financing assessments,  surcharge policies, preventive and remedial measures for  dealing with overdue financial obligations, and the burden- sharing mechanism (see Note 13).   The IMF has established limits on overall access to  resources in the GRA, except for the FCL arrangements that are not subject to any access limits (for limits applicable to  SLL arrangements, see below). The annual limit is normally  set at 145 percent of a member ’s quota, with a cumulative  limit of 435 percent of a mem ber’s quota (net of scheduled  repurchases). In response to the COVID-19 crisis, the annual  limit was temporarily increased to 245 percent of quota  annually for the period from July 13, 2020, through  December 31, 2021.   Access in excess of these limits can be granted in  exceptional circumstances. Except for PLL arrangements,  there is no prespecified maximum on exceptional access to IMF resources, which is assessed on a case-by-case basis in  accordance with the policy framework on exceptional access.  The IMF assesses factors such as the size of balance of  payments needs, the member’s debt sustainability and its  ability to regain access to financing from other sources, the  member’s capacity to repay the Fund, and the strength of  policies to be adopted.   PLL arrangements have a cumulative access limit of  500 percent of quota (net of scheduled repurchases). Access  under a six-month PLL arrangement is subject to a limit of  125 percent of quota. In exceptional circumstances where a member is experiencing or has the potential to experience  larger short-term balance of payments needs due to the I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021    20 impact of exogenous shocks, including heightened regional  or global stress conditions, access under a six-month PLL  arrangement is subject to a higher limit of 250 percent of  quota.  SLL arrangements have revolving access, and multiple  purchases and repurchases may take place during the  course of the arrangement, subj ect to a limit of 145 percent  of quota on the total credit outstanding at any given date under current or any prior SLL arrangements.   Further, in September 2020, the IMF established policy  safeguards when a member requests financing with  combined access to GRA and Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRG Trust) resources in excess of specified  thresholds. These thresholds are set at the same levels that  trigger application of the GRA exceptional access framework.  The safeguards are also broadly aligned with the criteria and  procedures applied in the GRA exceptional access  framework described above. There were no limits on combined access to GRA and PRG Trust resources prior to  September 2020.  The annual limit for RFI purchases is normally set at 50  percent of a member’s quota, with a cumulative limit of 100  percent of a member’s quota ( net of scheduled repurchases).  These limits were temporarily increased to 100 percent of  quota annually and 150 percent of  quota cumulatively (net of  scheduled repurchases) for the period from April 6, 2020,  through June 30, 2023.  Purchases under SBA and EFF arrangements are made in  tranches and are subject to conditionality in the form of performance criteria, indicative targets, structural  benchmarks, and prior actions, as well as regular reviews by  the Executive Board.   In addition, the IMF has adopted a safeguards policy to  mitigate the risk of misuse of resources and a misreporting policy to deal with incorrect reporting of data or performance  against any conditions under an IMF-supported program.  Safeguards assessments of member central banks are undertaken to provide the IMF with reasonable assurance  that the central bank’s legal structure, governance, control,  reporting, and auditing systems are adequate to maintain the integrity of its operations and to manage resources, including  IMF disbursements. When IMF resources are provided as  direct budget financing to the government, the safeguards policy also requires that IMF disbursements be deposited at  the central bank, and that an appropriate framework  agreement between the central bank and the government be  in place to ensure timely servicing of the member’s financial  obligations to the IMF. Further, a fiscal safeguards review of the state treasury is requir ed for cases where a member requests exceptional access, and at least 25 percent of IMF funds are expected to be used fo r direct budget financing.   The maximum credit risk exposure is the carrying value of the IMF’s credit outstanding a nd undrawn commitments.   4.2.1.1  Credit outstanding  Credit outstanding comprised SDR 93,031 million and  SDR 89,788 million at April 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively  (see Note 5). The concentration of GRA outstanding credit by  region was as follows:     The use of credit in the GRA by the largest users was as  follows:    The five largest users of GRA credit at April 30, 2022, and 2021, in descending order, were Argentina, Egypt, Ukraine,  Pakistan, and Ecuador. Credit outstanding by member is  presented in Schedule 1.  In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant number  of countries have benefited from emergency financial  assistance under the RFI (see Note 5.1), including 21  countries with a total disbursed amount of SDR 9,480 million  that did not have credit outst anding from the IMF at March  31, 2020. There is no ex-post program-based conditionality or reviews under the RFI, with overall conditionality limited.  4.2.1.2  Undrawn commitments  Undrawn commitments under GRA arrangements amounted  to SDR 102,614 million and SDR 93,457 million at April 30,  2022, and 2021, respectively. Commitments and undrawn balances under current arrangements are presented in  Schedule 3.

General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021     21 No purchases under RFIs had been approved by the  Executive Board, but not yet disbursed at April 30, 2022  (SDR 630 million at April 30, 2021).   The undrawn commitments under GRA arrangements have  also increased as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic (see  Note 1.5) as the IMF has approved new financial assistance under its lending arrangements (including to four countries  that had not had a lending arrangement with, or credit  outstanding to the IMF at Ma rch 31, 2020) and augmented  existing lending arrangements to accommodate urgent new  needs arising from the impact of the pandemic.  4.2.2  Market risk on financial assets and liabilities other than  investments Market risk is the risk that the fa ir value or future cash flows  of financial instruments will fl uctuate because of changes in  market prices. Market risk for financial assets and liabilities other than investments includes interest rate risk and  exchange rate risk.  4.2.2.1  Interest rate risk  Interest rate risk is the risk t hat future net cash flows will  fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. All interest-bearing financial instru ments other than investments  of the General Department accr ue interest either at the SDR  interest rate or at a rate that is linked to the SDR interest rate  (see Note 2.2). Interest rate risk is primarily managed by  linking the rate of charge directly, by means of a fixed margin, to the cost of financing (which is equal to the SDR  interest rate).   4.2.2.2  Exchange rate risk  Exchange rate risk is the risk that the General Department’s  financial position and cash flows will be affected by  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.    The General Department has no exchange rate risk  exposure on its holdings of members’ currencies in the GRA because members maintain the value of such  holdings in SDR terms (see Note 5).    The General Department has other assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than SDRs and makes  administrative payments largely in US dollars, but the exchange rate risk exposure associated with these  activities is limited.    The General Department has no exchange rate exposure  from its current borrowing arrangements because all  drawings are denominated in SDRs.  4.2.3  Liquidity risk on financial assets and liabilities other than investments  Liquidity risk is the risk to the General Department of  nonavailability of resources to meet the financing needs of  members and its own obligations. The IMF must have usable resources available to meet members’ demand for IMF  financing. While the IMF’s resources are largely of a  revolving nature, uncertainties in the timing and amount of  credit extended to members during financial crises expose the IMF to liquidity risk. Moreover, the IMF must also stand  ready to provide resources for unexpected needs, for  example, to: (i) meet, upon a member’s representation of  need, potential demands for a drawing on the member’s  reserve tranche; and (ii) authorize drawings to meet demands for encashment of creditor claims under the New  Arrangements to Borrow (NAB) or the bilateral borrowing  agreements (see Note 14).  The IMF manages its liquidity risk by closely scrutinizing  developments in its liquidity position. The IMF’s main liquidity  measure—Forward Commitment Capacity -represents the  IMF’s capacity to make new GRA resources available to its  members over the following 12 months (see Schedule 2).   Long-term liquidity needs are addressed by reviewing the  adequacy of quota-based resources. General reviews of  members’ quotas are conducted at regular intervals to  evaluate the adequacy of quot a-based resources to meet  members’ demand for IMF financing. The IMF may also borrow to supplement its quota resources (see Note 14).  Short-term liquidity needs for financing activities are reviewed  and approved by the Executive Board on a periodic basis  through a financial transactions plan for quota resources and  the resource mobilization plan for borrowed resources.   4.2.3.1  Maturity profile of fi nancial assets and liabilities other  than investments  Depending on the type of financing instrument, repurchase  periods for GRA credit vary from 3¼ to 10 years. Scheduled  and overdue repurchases of outstanding GRA credit are  summarized below:      Repayments of outstanding borrowings are determined  according to the schedule of repurchases of credit that was  financed by borrowed resources. They also take into account  the maximum maturity of outstanding borrowings, which was  April 30, 2022  April 30, 2021   Financial year (in millions of SDRs )  2022 —  8,961  2023 19,198  19,777  2024 23,252  24,006  2025  18,497  18,183  2026 9,494  7,842  2027 6,446  3,692  2028 and beyond 16,144  7,185  Overdue —  142  Total 93,031  89,788  I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021    22 equal to 10 years for all outstanding borrowings. Scheduled  repayments of outstanding borrowings are summarized  below:    Repurchases during the financial years ended April 30, 2022,  and 2021, included advance repurchases of SDR 3,797 million and SDR 3,677 million, respectively.  These advance repurchases resulted in earlier than  scheduled repayments of outstanding borrowings of SDR 1,134 million and SDR 2,094 million, respectively.  Future interest payments on borrowings calculated at the  SDR interest rate at April 30, 2022, represent SDR 10 million for the financial year ending April 30, 2023. Thereafter, a total  of SDR 3 million will be paid th rough the last repayment date.  Usable and other currencies, SDR holdings, and quota subscriptions do not have maturity dates.  4.3  Investments  Investments are exposed to credit, market, and liquidity risks.  4.3.1  Credit risk on investments  Credit risk on investments repr esents the potential loss if  issuers and counterparties were to default on their  contractual obligations.   Credit risk in the IA is minimized by limiting fixed-income  investments to financial instrum ents with a credit rating at the  time of acquisition:   For the Fixed-Income Subaccount, effective January 12,  2022 the minimum credit rating is set at the equivalent of  BBB– (based on Standard & Poor’s long-term rating scale)  for corporate bonds and BBB+ for all other assets (at least A for all assets before January 12, 2022).    For the Endowment Subaccount, the minimum credit rating is set at BBB+ for so vereign bonds and BBB– for  corporate bonds and private infrastructure debt. Limited holdings in the Endowment Subaccount of corporate  bonds and private infrastructure debt rated below BBB–  are permitted under the Rules and Regulations of the  Investment Account.   Exempt from the credit rating requirement are instruments  issued by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS),  which does not have a credit ra ting, central bank deposits,  and short-term instruments.  The carrying amount of the fixed-income instruments represents the maximum exposure to credit risk. The credit  risk exposure for fixed-income instruments in the IA, at the  end of the respective reporting periods, was as follows:   Fixed-Income Subaccount    April 30, 2022 April 30, 2021  (as a percentage of total investments in  fixed-income instruments)   Not rated (BIS) — 0.0% 2,557 15.6%  AAA  5,422 29.3% 5,918 36.2%  AA+ to AA–  7,075 38.3% 3,435 21.0%  A+ to A  5,741 31.1% 4,305 26.4%  BBB+ 240 1.3% 125 0.8%  Total  18,478 100.0% 16,340 100.0%      Counterparty risk for derivative instruments is mitigated by strict exposure limits, cr edit rating requirements, and  collateral requirements. The ma ximum exposure to credit risk  for derivative instruments is the amount of any unrealized  gains on such contracts.   The credit risk exposure for derivative instruments in the  Fixed-Income Subaccount amounted to SDR 106 million and  SDR 38 million at April 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The  credit risk exposure for derivative instruments in the Endowment Subaccount amounted to SDR 58 million and  SDR 5 million at April 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively.  4.3.2  Market risk on investments  Market risk is the risk that the fa ir value or future cash flows  of financial instruments will fl uctuate because of changes in  market prices. Market risk for investments incl udes interest  rate risk, exchange rate risk, and other price risks.  The investment objectives of the Fixed-Income and  Endowment Subaccounts differ, and the investment  strategies, including asset allocation and risk tolerance, are  tailored for each of the subacc ounts, thereby exposing them  to different types of market risk.

General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021     23 4.3.2.1  Fixed-Income Subaccount  The Fixed-Income Subaccount holds debt obligations of a  broad range of issuers within limits defined by the Rules and  Regulations of the IA (see Note 7.1 for the eligible investments). Market risk is mitigated through asset class  diversification and within asset classes through broad security selection.   The Fixed-Income Subaccount authorizes the use of  derivative instruments for managing interest rate risk, currency hedging, or reducing co sts in the context of portfolio  balancing, benchmark replication, and market access. Safeguards are in place against short selling and financial leverage.  Exchange rate risk is mitigated by hedging investments  denominated in non-SDR currencies into SDR basket currencies with the objective of preserving the Fixed-Income  Subaccount’s SDR basket composition.  4.3.2.2  Endowment Subaccount   Investments are divided into eight categories, which are  subject to varying market risks and benefits from  diversification properties (see  Note 7.2 for the eligible  investments). Market risk is mitigated through asset class  diversification and within asset classes through broad security selection.   Effective January 12, 2022, except for the allocation to  emerging market equities, which may be managed actively, all Endowment Subaccount assets shall be managed  passively (prior to January 12, 2022, the Endowment  Subaccount was split into the passively-managed portfolio managed in accordance with the strategic asset allocation  and the actively-managed portfolio, which could comprise up  to 10 percent of the Endowment assets, invested in the same  asset categories with target  shares for fixed-income  instruments and equities with out specific allocation  requirements within those shares).   The Endowment Subaccount authorizes the use of derivative  instruments for managing interest rate risk, currency hedging, or reducing costs in the cont ext of portfolio balancing,  benchmark replication, and market access.   Because the IMF’s administrative expenditures are largely in  US dollars and the Endowment Subaccount’s general  objective is to contribute to  covering such expenditures (see  Note 1.2), the performance of the Endowment Subaccount is  measured in US dollars as the base currency but translated into SDRs for financial reporting. The Rules and Regulations  of the IA provide for hedging against the exchange rate risk  for fixed-income instruments denominated in developed  market currencies vis-à-vis the US dollar. The valuation changes from exchange rate fluctuations are included in the determination of investment income.   4.3.2.3  Value at risk  Exposures to market risk, including interest rate, exchange rate, and other price risks, are measured using VaR, which  considers known market risks in each of the asset categories  and the effect of asset class diversification. VaR estimates  reported below represent the maximum potential loss in  value of the assets over the ne xt year due to adverse market  movements with a 95 percent c onfidence level. There is a  1 in 20 chance that annual losses on investment assets are equal to or exceed the reported VaR. Losses in a single year could exceed the reported VaR by a significant amount.  The VaR model is based on historical simulations with a  three-year look back period and monthly overlapping risk factor returns for each individual instrument in the portfolios  to produce plausible future scenarios based on these  simulations. In each simulation scenario, risk factor data on the valuation date is shocked according to past observations  and each instrument is repriced, resulting in a hypothetical  empirical distribution of re turns. There is no standard  methodology for estimating VaR, and the modeling of the market risk characteristics of the investments involves many  assumptions and some limited pr oxy or substitutes. Different  assumptions or methodologies would produce significantly different VaR estimates.   The VaR for the Fixed-Income Subaccount portfolio was as  follows:   April 30, 2022 April 30, 2021   (in millions of SDRs )  Tranche 1 (see Note 7) 169 65  Tranche 2 (see Note 7) 107 58  Diversification effects (26) (47)  Total Fixed-Income Subaccount 250 76   I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021    24 The VaR for the Endowment Subaccount portfolio was as  follows:   April 30, 2022 April 30, 2021   (in millions of SDRs )  Passively managed portfolio:   Developed market equities 397 493  Emerging market equities 182 203  Global Sovereign bonds 66 —  Developed market sovereign bonds n/a1 65  Developed market corporate bonds 60 51  Emerging market bonds n/a1 17  US Treasury Inflation-Protected        Securities 68 52  Real estate investment trusts 175 97  Private infrastructure debt 17 5  Infrastructure equities 55 —  Diversification effects (296) (236)  Total for passively managed  portfolio 724 747  Actively managed portfolio:    Fixed-income securities — 10  Equity securities — 39  Diversification effects — (11)  Total for actively managed portfolio — 38  1 Following the changes to the investment  strategy approved by the Executive  Board on January 12, 2022, the investment categories of developed market  sovereign bonds and emerging market bonds were restructured into the global sovereign bonds category.     4.3.3  Liquidity risk on investments  Liquidity risk on investments refers to the risk that an investment will not have an active buyer or seller when  traded, which could negatively affect the price of the  investment.  The IA’s liquidity needs are low and the liquidity risk is  minimal because both subaccounts hold the majority of their resources in readily marketable short-term investments. 4.3.3.1  Maturity profile of investments The maturities of the fixed-income securities and derivatives  in the Fixed-Income Subaccount were as follows:     April 30, 2022 April 30, 2021  Financial year  (in millions of SDRs)   2022  — 6,909  2023 5,659 3,131  2024 5,294 2,179  2025  3,346 1,554  2026 2,110 1,254  2027 1,535 425  2028 and beyond 891 1,154  Total 18,835 16,606   The maturities of the fixed-income securities and derivatives  in the Endowment Subaccount were as follows:   April 30, 2022 April 30, 2021  Financial year  (in millions of SDRs)   2022  — 392  2023 496 376  2024 344 396  2025  388 455  2026 390 461  2027 361 303  2028 and beyond 1,331 1,346  Total 3,310 3,729    Investments in both subaccounts largely represent liquid  investments, which could be sold earlier than their maturity,  whenever necessary.  4.4  Post-employment benefit plans  The General Department is exposed to investment, liquidity, and longevity risks associated wit h post-employment benefit  plans (the Plans). These risks are balanced a gainst the need  to meet the financial obligations of each plan. The Plans have adopted general guidelines on permissible investments and plan assets are invested a ccording to a strategic asset  allocation, which is expected to generate a rate of return at or in excess of the rate of growth in the Plans’ liabilities. The strategic asset allocation is reviewed periodically by the  Investment Committee. The strategic asset allocation is  designed to minimize the level of portfolio market risk  (volatility) for the targeted rate of return, while better aligning  portfolio volatility with the potential volatility of the Plans’  liabilities. Through a global, multiple-asset-class investment  approach, the portfolio risk is r educed for any targeted rate of  return, because asset class returns are not perfectly  correlated as regional and global economic, financial, and political events unfold. The Pl ans do not utilize specific,  targeted asset-liability matching  instruments or strategies I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021     25 such as annuities, longevity swaps, cash flow matching, or  duration matching.  The primary objective with respect to liquidity is to have  sufficient liquid resources available to pay benefits when due. This risk is monitored to ensure that payments due to the  participants and beneficiaries can be met from the holdings  of cash and highly liquid investments of the Plans.  4.5  Precautionary balances  Precautionary balances consist of the GRA reserves (excluding that portion repres enting the profits from the  2009–10 gold sales that have been earmarked for the  Endowment Subaccount), and t he balance in the SCA-1.  They are a key element of the Fund’s multilayered risk  management framework as they provide a buffer to protect  the Fund against unexpected losses resulting from credit,  income, and other financial risks. The Executive Board conducted an interim review of the adequacy of  precautionary balances in December 2021, ahead of the  standard two-year cycle given the need for close monitoring  due to the heightened uncertainty in the global economy  linked to the pandemic and the path and timing of the recovery. In concluding the interim review, the Executive  Board kept the medium-term indicative target and minimum  floor for precautionary balances at SDR 25 billion and SDR 15 billion, respectively (the medium-term indicative  target had been raised from SDR 20 billion to SDR 25 billion  during the previous review of the precautionary balances in November 2020).  During the December 2021 interim review, the Executive  Board approved a new approach for the treatment of retirement benefit plans in th e computation of precautionary  balances. This approach better reflects the role of precautionary balances as a long-term buffer for economic  and financial risks. Under the new approach, referred to as  the ‘economic basis’, the defined benefit liability of the plans  is measured using a discount rate that reflects the  expected  long-term return on plan assets. Any net liability measured under the economic basis is used in calculating precautionary balances in place of the net asset/liability  calculated under IAS 19 (see Note 11). However, any net  asset measured under the economic basis would not be used in calculating precautionary bala nces. The change took effect  from May 1, 2021. A one-time increase of SDR 205 million was made to precautionary ba lances as at that date,  reflecting the accumulated net loss to date, to align with the new measurement methodology.   At April 30, 2022, and 2021, precautionary balances  amounted to SDR 20.9 billion and SDR 20.0 billion,  respectively, and were calculated as follows:   April 30, 2022  April 30, 2021   (in millions of SDRs)  Special Reserve (Note 16)  13,692 11,347  General Reserve (Note 16) 12,832 12,003  Excluding profits from gold sales (4,403) (4,403)  Adjustment for net assets/liabilities under  retirement benefit plans under  IAS 19 (Note 11.2) (1,248) n/a  Adjustment for net liabilities  under retirement benefit plans  under the economic basis —1 n/a   SCA-1 (Note 13.2)   — 1,066  Total precautionary balances 20,873 20,013  1 The measurement of the retirement benefit plans under the economic basis  resulted in a net pension asset at April 30, 2022. As such, further adjustments to  precautionary balances were not required after excluding the net assets/liabilities determined under IAS 19.  5.  Currencies, including credit outstanding  Under the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, members are  required to maintain the value of the GRA’s holdings of their  currencies in terms of the SDR. Any depreciation or  appreciation in a member’s currency vis-à-vis the SDR gives  rise to a currency valuation adjustment receivable or payable that must be settled by the mem ber promptly after the end of  the financial year or at other times as requested by the IMF  or the member. Currency holdi ngs of SDR 454,718 million at  April 30, 2022, included receivables and payables arising  from those valuation adjustm ents of SDR 19,796 million and  SDR 13,073 million, respectively (currency holdings of  SDR 458,656 million at April 30, 2021, included receivables  and payables of SDR 25,618 million and SDR 10,182 million,  respectively).  All holdings of members’ currencies are typically revalued at  the IMF’s financial year-end.   5.1  Credit outstanding  At April 30, 2022, and 2021, members’ use of GRA credit  was represented by currency holdings of SDR 93,031 million  and SDR 89,788 million, respectively. I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021    26 Changes in credit outstanding under the various facilities of  the GRA were as follows:  1 Other facilities include legacy credit under Enlarged Access and Supplementary  Financing Facility.    1 Other facilities include legacy credit under Enlarged Access and Supplementary  Financing Facility.    5.1.1  Emergency financial assistance  The tables above reflect emergency financing under the RFI  that was provided by the General Department to members  facing urgent balance of payment s needs as a result of the  economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Credit  outstanding by member is presented in Schedule 1.  Following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the access  limits for RFI purchases were temporarily increased (see  Note 4.2.1).  5.1.2  Impairment analysis  The General Department has performed an impairment  analysis of credit outstanding  in accordance with its ECL  model (see Note 3.2.1.1). Based on this analysis, no loss  allowance was deemed to be necessary at April 30, 2022,  and 2021. As described in Note 3.2.1.1, the impairment analysis of the General Depa rtment’s credit outstanding  takes into account the unique  nature of the IMF’s financing  and its institutional status, and is performed holistically for  each debtor member based on  qualitative an d quantitative  considerations and taking into account relevant current developments, including the geopolitical and global economic developments as described in Note 1.5. In this context, the  results of the impairment ana lysis at April 30, 2022, and  2021, are not materially sensitive to reasonable changes in  input parameters of the ECL calculation.  5.2  Overdue obligations  At April 30, 2022, no member was six months or more overdue in settling its financial obligations to the General  Department (one member—Sudan—was six months or more  overdue in settling its financial obligations to the General Department at April 30, 2021).   On June 29, 2021, Sudan settled all of its overdue  obligations to the General Department, including GRA credit outstanding and overdue char ges of SDR 142 million and  SDR 738 million, respectively . Settlement of the overdue  charges generated burden-sharing refunds to members totaling SDR 611 million that had been previously collected  through burden-sharing adjustments to charges and  remuneration (see Notes 13.1, 13.2, 17, and 18).   6.  SDR holdings  The General Department can receive SDRs from members in  the settlement of their financia l obligations to the GRA and  quota subscription payments. In  addition, the GRA may use  or receive SDRs in transactions and operations with members, including the provision of financial assistance to  members, the receipt of charges and fees, and the payment of remuneration on reserve tranche positions or interest on  borrowings to member countries and lenders.  At April 30, 2022, and 2021, the SDR holdings of the General  Department amounted to SDR 22,270 million and  SDR 22,203 million, respectively.  The GRA earns interest on its SDR holdings at the same rate  as other holders of SDRs. Interest on SDR holdings during  the financial years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021, amounted to SDR 25 million and SDR 17 million,  respectively.  7.

General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021     27 During the financial year ended April 30, 2022,  SDR 2,393 million was transferred from the GRA to the IA, as  approved by the Executiv e Board (SDR 319 million  transferred from the IA to the GRA during the financial year  ended April 30, 2021).  On January 12, 2022, the Executive Board reviewed the  strategy of the Investm ent Account and approved  refinements to the investment strategies of the Fixed-Income Subaccount and the Endowment Subaccount, as reflected in Notes 1.2, 4.3.1, 4. 3.2, 7.1, and 7.2. Im plementation of these  changes has been initiated, but will be completed during the year ending April 30, 2023.  7.1  Fixed-Income Subaccount   The Fixed-Income Subaccount comprises two tranches, a  shorter-duration Tranche 1 and a longer-duration Tranche 2.  Effective January 12, 2022, the average duration of the  Fixed-Income Subaccount should not exceed three years  (prior to January 12, 2022, the Fixed-Income Subaccount  had an average duration limit of two and a half years with  Tranche 1 managed against a zero- to three-year  government bond benchmark index and Tranche 2 against a zero- to five-year government bond benchmark index).  Tranche 1 is managed actively, while Tranche 2 is managed  according to a buy-and-hold investment approach, which in limited circumstances allows for the sale of investments in  accordance with the overall in vestment strategy prior to  maturity. Tranche 2 was phased in over a five-year period, which concluded in 2021. Prior to completion, assets pending  investment in Tranche 2 were placed in fixed term deposits.  Both tranches can be invested in debt obligations issued by  national governments of member s, their central banks and  official agencies, international financial institutions, and obligations of the BIS, denomi nated in SDRs or currencies  included in the SDR basket, referred to as Group 1 assets for investment management purposes . Eligible investments in  Tranche 1 also include fixed-income securities issued by  subnational governments, corporate bonds,  mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, and cash instruments with maturities  of one year or less, referred  to as Group 2 assets for investment management purposes. Assets are being invested by external managers, except for investments with the BIS and short-term investments  (residual cash balances). Effective January 12, 2022, Group 2 assets should not exceed 40 percent of the Fixed-Income  Subaccount portfolio (35 percent before January 12, 2022).         Investments in the Fixed-Income Subaccount were as follows:   April 30, 2022   Tranche 1 Tranche 2 Total    (in millions of SDRs)   At fair value through profit or loss:    International financial institutions  obligations:          Medium-term instruments (BIS)  — — —       Others  528 1,701 2,229  Sovereign bonds 7,199 4,693 11,892  Corporate bonds 3,616 — 3,616  Securitized assets 741 — 741  Short-term investments 214 37 251  Derivative assets  106 — 106  Total at fair value through profit or  loss 12,404 6,431 18,835  At amortized cost:     Fixed-term deposits — — —  Total 12,404 6,431 18,835     April 30, 2021   Tranche 1 Tranche 2 Total   (in millions of SDRs)  At fair value through profit or loss:    International financial institutions  obligations:          Medium-term instruments (BIS)  — 1,806 1,806       Others  439 569 1,008  Sovereign bonds 7,786 1,615 9,401  Corporate bonds 2,757 — 2,757  Securitized assets 616 — 616  Short-term investments 215 14 229  Derivative assets  38 — 38  Total at fair value through profit or  loss 11,851 4,004 15,855  At amortized cost:     Fixed-term deposits — 751 751  Total 11,851 4,755 16,606   I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021    28 Fair values of derivative assets and liabilities in the  Fixed-Income Subaccount at April 30, 2022, were  SDR 106 million and SDR 77 million, respectively  (SDR 38 million and SDR 40 million for derivative assets and liabilities, respectively, at April 30, 2021). Notional values of  derivative instruments were as follows:  7.2  Endowment Subaccount   The assets of the Endowment Subaccount are invested in a  globally diversified portfolio consisting of fixed-income and equity instruments (including REITs), and private  infrastructure debt. Assets are invested by external  managers, except for short-term investments (residual cash balances).   The Endowment Subaccount is invested in accordance with  the strategic asset allocation in  select investment categories  approved by the Executive Board.  Each investment category  is invested to achieve exposure to broad characteristics of the specific asset class.   The refinements to the investm ent strategy approved by the  Executive Board on January 12, 2022, modified the strategic  asset allocation by reorganizing some investment categories  and shifting the allocations between the categories including:  (i) a reduction in the allocation to government bonds; (ii) a reduction in inflation-linked bonds; (iii) a dedicated allocation  to infrastructure equities; and (iv) an increase in REITS.  The strategic asset allocation includes a 5 percent allocation  to private infrastructure debt. The IMF invests in this asset  class through commingled funds and its commitments are  drawn down over time based on notices from the respective  investment managers. At Apr il 30, 2022 and April 30, 2021,  total original commitments amounted to SDR 171 million.  During the financial year ended April 30, 2022, total capital  calls under the commitments totaled SDR 96 million and  distributions amounting to SDR 1 million were paid back to the General Department (SDR 14 million and SDR 1 million  for capital calls and distributions, respectively, during the financial year ended April 30, 2021). Investments in the Endowment Subaccount, all of which are classified as FVPL, consisted of the following investment  categories:   April 30, 2022 April 30, 2021   (in millions of SDRs)   Passively managed portfolio:    Developed market sovereign bonds n/a1 894  Developed market corporate bonds 927 1,005  Emerging market bonds n/a1 274  Global sovereign bonds 971 —  US Treasury Inflation-Protected        Securities 969 1,214  Developed market equities 1,614 1,565  Emerging market equities 643 639  Infrastructure equities 340 —  Real estate investment trusts 676 347  Private infrastructure debt 97 12  Short-term investments 288 184  Total passively managed portfolio  6,525 6,134  Actively managed portfolio:    Fixed-income securities — 143  Equity securities — 134  Short-term investments — 10  Total actively managed portfolio — 287  Derivative assets  58 5  Total 6,583 6,426  1 Following the changes to the investment  strategy approved by the Executive  Board on January 12, 2022, the investment categories of developed market  sovereign bonds and emerging market bonds were restructured into the global sovereign bonds category.     Investment categories comprise funds managed to achieve  exposure to broad characteristics of the specific asset class.  Funds may include holdings in other asset classes. Market  exposure may be achieved throug h derivative instruments,  where necessary and as determined under the IA’s Rules  and Regulations.  Fair values of derivative assets and liabilities in the  Endowment Subaccount at April 30, 2022, were SDR 58 million and SDR 15 million, respectively  (SDR 5 million and SDR 16 million for derivative assets and liabilities, respectively, at April 30, 2021).

Fair value measurement   Valuation techniques used to value financial instruments  include the following:  Level 1  The fair value of publicly tr aded investments is based on  quoted market prices in an active market for identical assets  without any adjustments (clo sing price for equities and  derivative instruments and bi d price for fixed-income  securities). These investments are included within Level 1 of  the fair value hierarchy.   Level 2 The fair value of equity and fixed-income securities not actively traded is determined on the basis of a compilation of  significant observable market information, such  as recently  executed trades in securities of the issuer or comparable  issuers and yield curves. The assessment also takes into  account the inherent risk and terms and conditions of each security. Given that the significant inputs are observable,  these securities are included wit hin Level 2 of the fair value  hierarchy.   The fair value of over-the-c ounter derivative instruments  (foreign exchange forwards, curr ency/interest rate swaps) not  actively traded is determined using a pricing model that  incorporates foreign exchange spot and forward rates and interest rate curves. Given that  the significant inputs into the  pricing models are market obser vable, these instruments are  included within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.  Level 3  The private infrastructure debt assets classified within Level  3 have significant unobserva ble inputs, as they trade  infrequently or do not trade at all. As observable prices are  not available for these assets, the mark-to-model valuation  technique is used to derive the fair value. Different assumptions or approximations could produce significantly  different valuation estimates.   8.1  Investments   The following tables present the fair value hierarchy used to  determine the fair value of investments in the IA:   April 30, 2022   Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total  (in millions of SDRs)   Recurring fair value measurements    Fixed-Income Subaccount 133 18,702 — 18,835  Endowment Subaccount 3,270 3,216 97 6,583  Total 3,403 21,918 97 25,418     April 30, 2021   Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total  (in millions of SDRs)   Recurring fair value measurements    Fixed-Income Subaccount 194 15,661 — 15,855  Endowment Subaccount 2,707 3,707 12 6,426  Total 2,901 19,368 12 22,281    During the financial year ended April 30, 2022, investments totaling SDR 11 million in the Endowment Subaccount were transferred from Level 1 to Level 2 (there were no transfers  from Level 1 to Level 2 in the Fixed-Income Subaccount).  These investments relate to equity securities where trading was either inactive or quoted prices in the applicable market  were not observable as at April 30, 2022. Quoted prices for  similar securities directly observable in an alternative market  were used for fair value measurement of these securities as  at April 30, 2022. During the financial year ended April 30, 2021, there were no transfers from level 1 to level 2 in both  the Fixed-Income and Endowment Subaccounts.    There were no transfers between levels 2 and 3 of fair value  hierarchy in both the Fixed-Income and Endowment  Subaccounts during the financial years ended April 30, 2022,  and 2021. I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021    30 Fixed-term deposits in the IA are generally of a short-term  nature and are carried at amorti zed cost, which approximates  fair value.  Derivative liabilities at April 30, 2022 comprised  SDR 16 million valued based on quoted market prices  (Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy) and SDR 76 million  valued based on observable market data (Level 2 in the fair  value hierarchy) (SDR 8 million and SDR 48 million for  Level 1 and Level 2, respectively, at April 30, 2021).  8.2  Credit outstanding   The IMF plays a unique role in providing balance of  payments support to member countries. IMF financing  features policy conditions that  require member countries to  implement macroeconomic and structural policies and are an  integral part of IMF financing. These measures aim to help  countries resolve their balanc e of payments problems while  safeguarding IMF resources. The fair value of IMF credit  outstanding cannot be deter mined due to its unique  characteristics, including the debtor’s membership relationship with the IMF, and the absence of a principal or  most advantageous market for IMF credit.   8.3  Other financial assets and liabilities   The carrying value of other financial assets and liabilities that  are classified at AC represents a reasonable estimate of their  fair value at April 30, 2022, and 2021.  9.  Gold holdings   The IMF acquired its gold holdings from quota subscriptions and financial transactions prior to the entry into force of the  Second Amendment of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement  (April 1, 1978). At April 30,  2022, and 2021, the IMF held  gold of 2,814 metric tons, equal to 90.474 million fine troy ounces, at designated depositories. Gold holdings were valued at a historical cost of SDR 3,167 million at April 30,  2022, and 2021, based on a cost of SDR 35 per fine troy ounce.  At April 30, 2022, the market value of the IMF’s holdings of  gold was SDR 128.6 billion (SDR 111.4 billion at  April 30, 2021).   10.  Property, plant and equipment and intangible  assets  Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, net of  depreciation and amortization, amounted to SDR 551 million and SDR 555 million at April 30, 2022, and 2021,  respectively, and consisted of land, buildings, equipment,  furniture, and software.   Land Buildings Other Total   (in millions of SDRs)   Financial year ended April 30, 2022:    Cost          Beginning of the year 95 437 420 952          Additions — 2 46 48          Disposals — — (16) (16)      End of the year 95 439 450 984  Accumulated depreciation and amortization:      Beginning of the year — 175 222 397        Depreciation and amortization — 12 40 52        Disposals — — (16) (16)      End of the year — 187 246 433  Net book value at April 30, 2022 95 252 204 551      Depreciation and amortization expenses of SDR 52 million  and SDR 49 million are included in administrative expenses  for the financial years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively.  11.  Employee benefits  11.1  Overview of the Plans  The IMF has a defined benefit Staff Retirement Plan (SRP) that covers all eligible staff and a Supplemental Retirement  Benefits Plan (SRBP) for a subset of participants of the SRP.  The SRBP provides for the payment of benefits that  otherwise would have been payable had the US qualified  plan benefits and compensation limits not applied. Participants in the SRP and SRBP (the pension plans) are  entitled to unreduced annual pensions beginning at the  normal retirement age of 62 or earlier if certain conditions of  age and service are met. The mandatory retirement age is  Land Buildings Other Total   (in millions of SDRs)  Financial year ended April 30, 2021:    Cost          Beginning of the year 95 436 401 932        Additions — 1 46 47        Disposals — — (27) (27)      End of the year 95 437 420 952  Accumulated depreciation and amortization:      Beginning of the year — 163 212 375        Depreciation and amortization — 12 37 49        Disposals — — (27) (27)      End of the year — 175 222 397  Net book value at April 30, 2021 95 262 198 555 I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021     31 65. The pension plans also provide an option for eligible staff  to receive reduced pension be nefits beginning at the age of  50. The level of pension benefits depends on the participants’ length of service and highest three-year average pensionable gross compensation. Participants may also elect upon  retirement to commute a portion of the lifetime pension  benefits into a lump-sum payment.  On June 3, 2021, the Executiv e Board approved changes to  the SRP and SRBP with an effect ive date of May 1, 2022, to  update the formula for the co mputation of the pensionable  gross compensation. The amount of past service cost  resulting from these changes recognized in the statement of income for the year ended April 30, 2022, amounted to  negative SDR 57 million.   The IMF provides other non-pension long-term benefits,  including medical insurance, life insurance, separation and  repatriation benefits, accrued annual leave, and associated  tax allowances. The IMF has established a separate account, the Retired Staff Benefits Investment Account (RSBIA), to  hold and invest resources set asid e to fund the cost of certain  post-retirement benefits.   In May 2020, the Executive Board approved changes to  separation and repatriation benef its with an effective date of  October 1, 2020. The past servic e cost resulting from these  changes recognized in the stat ement of income for the year  ended April 30, 2021, amounted to SDR 6 million. In April 2022, the Executive Board ap proved changes to medical  benefits covered by the RSBI A with an effective date of  January 1, 2023. The past service cost resulting from these changes recognized in the stat ement of income for the year  ended April 30, 2022 was a gain of SDR 112 million.  The assets in the SRP, SRBP, and RSBIA (collectively, the  Plans) are held separately from  the assets of all other  accounts of the IMF. Also, the net asset position in one of the  Plans cannot be netted with the net liability position in  another Plan. In the event the IMF were to exercise its right  to terminate the Plans, the assets of these plans would be used to satisfy liabilities to par ticipants, retired participants,  and their beneficiaries and other liabilities of the pension plans. Any remaining assets would be returned to the GRA. The GRA meets the costs of administering the Plans, and the  SRP and RSBIA reimburse the GRA for investment-related  costs.   The Executive Board and t he Pension Committee are  responsible for the governance of the Plans. The Executive  Board approves the funding framework and amendments to  the Plans. The Pension Committ ee, consisting of members of  the Executive Board a nd senior staff, super vises and controls  the overall administration of  the SRP and the SRBP. The  Pension Committee also undert akes periodic valuations of the assets and liabilities related to the Plans and advises the  Executive Board on the appropri ate funding framework. It is  supported by an Investment Committee to oversee the investments of the Plans.  11.2  Net assets/liabilities and benefit costs under  retirement benefit plans  The amounts recognized in the statements of financial  position were as follows:   April 30, 2022 April 30,  2021   Pension  benefits Other  employee  benefits Total   Total    (in millions of SDRs)   Defined benefit  obligation (8,610) (1,856) (10,466) (11,425)  Plan assets 9,404 2,310 11,714 11,220  Net assets 794 581 1,375 —  Net liabilities  — (127) (127) (205)    The amounts recognized in the statements of income and  statements of comprehensive income were as follows:   2022 2021   Pension  benefits Other  employee  benefits Total Total    (in millions of SDRs)   Service cost (262) (105) (367) (407)  Past service cost 57 112 169 (6)  Interest expense related to  defined benefit obligation (280) (71) (351) (335)  Interest income related to plan assets 271 65 336 244  Net periodic pension cost  recognized in the statements of income (214) 1 (213) (504)  Remeasurement of defined benefit obligation 1,405 630 2,035 457  Net return on plan assets excluding amounts included in interest income (393) (94) (487) 2,532  Exchange differences (19) (14) (33) 166  Amounts recognized in other comprehensive income 993 522 1,515 3,155  Total gain recognized in  statements of  comprehensive income 779 523 1,302 2,651   I.

The actuarially  determined employer contributions to the pension plans  during the financial year ended April 30, 2022 amounted to 10.66 percent of pensionable gross compensation  (13.06 percent of pensionable gross compensation during the  financial year ended April 30, 2021). Under the IMF’s funding  framework, the budgetary allocations for payments to the  pension plans have been set at 14 percent of pensionable gross compensation. The IMF expects to contribute  SDR 150 million to the Plans during the financial year ending  April 30, 2023.  The expected pension and benefits payments to be paid out  by the Plans over the next five years were as follows at  April 30, 2022:  Financial year  Pension  benefits  Other  employee  benefits Total  (in millions of SDRs)  2023 332 85 417  2024 348 70 418  2025 368 74 442  2026 385 76 461  2027 401 79 480  11.3  Principal actuarial assumptions  The IMF conducts a comprehensive analysis of the principal actuarial assumptions used in calculating the net assets/liabilities under retirement benefit plans every five  years and reviews their applicability on an annual basis. The  most recent five-year analysis was completed in April 2021.

Burden-sharing and the Special Contingent  Account  13.1  Burden-sharing for deferred charges   The IMF has adopted a burden-sharing mechanism to  address the financial consequences of member countries’  failure to settle financial obligations to the GRA on time.  Under the burden-sharing mechanism, resources are generated by increasing the rate of charge paid by borrowers  and reducing the rate of remuneration paid to creditor  members to cover shortfalls in the GRA’s income due to the  nonpayment of charges.   Members that participated in  burden-sharing for overdue  charges receive refunds to the extent that t hese charges are  subsequently settled by the defaulting member. During the financial year ended April 30, 2022, the General  Department refunded the full amount of remaining burden- sharing adjustments amounting to SDR 611 million resulting  from the settlement of all outstanding overdue GRA charges  previously deferred (see Note 5.2). There were no deferred charges at April 30, 2022.  There were no burden-sharing refunds during the financial  year ended April 30, 2021. Overdue charges that resulted in  adjustments to charges and remuneration for the year ended  April 30, 2021, amounted to SDR 2 million (see Note 17). Cumulative overdue charges that resulted in adjustments to  charges and remuneration since May 1, 1986 (the date the  burden-sharing mechanism was adopted) amounted to SDR 2,051 million at April 30, 2021. The cumulative refunds  for the same period, resulting from the settlements of  overdue charges for which burden-sharing adjustments had  been made, amounted to SDR 1,440 million at  April 30, 2021.   13.2  Burden-sharing for the SCA-1  The burden-sharing mechanism has also financed additions  to the SCA-1, which offers protection against the risk of loss  resulting from the ultimate failure of a member to repay its overdue obligations to the GRA.   Contributions to the SCA-1 are to be returned when there are  no outstanding overdue repurchases and charges, or at such earlier time as the Executive Board may decide.  During the financial year ended April 30, 2022, in connection  with the clearance of Sudan’ s arrears to the IMF, the  Executive Board decided to make a distribution of the remaining SDR 1,066 million in the SCA-1 to contributing members. The distribution took place on June 29, 2021, and  the SCA-1 balance amounted to zero at April 30, 2022  (SDR 1,066 million at April 30, 2021). I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021    34 Effective November 1, 2006, t he Executive Board decided to  suspend, for the time being, further additions to the SCA-1.  Accordingly, no additions have been made to the SCA-1  during the financial years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021.   14.  Borrowings  The GRA can borrow to temporarily supplement its quota  resources. The Executive Boar d has established guidelines  on borrowing by the GRA to ensur e that the financing of the  GRA is managed in a prudent and systemic manner.   The GRA’s main standing borrowing arrangement is the  NAB. The GRA may also borrow under bilateral agreements, in particular loan and note purchase agreements (bilateral  borrowing agreements). At April 30, 2022, the NAB credit  arrangements amounted to SDR 360.8 billion and the bilateral borrowing agreements amounted to  SDR 138.1 billion; see Schedules 4 and 5, respectively.  14.1  New Arrangements to Borrow   The NAB is a standing set of credit arrangements with 40 participants, of which 38 ag reements were effective at  April 30, 2022, and 2021. The NAB provides supplementary  resources to the GRA as a second line of defense to IMF  quotas.   NAB periods are renewed periodically. In January 2020, the  Executive Board approved a NAB reform that doubled NAB  commitments and set a new NAB period through end 2025.  NAB participants have since provided the necessary consents and this reform took effect as targeted on January  1, 2021. Following the effect iveness of the reform, the  effective NAB commitments amounted to 360.8 billion at April 30, 2022, and 2021.  NAB resources can be activated when the Fund’s resources  need to be supplemented in order to forestall or cope with an  impairment of the internat ional monetary system. The  activation requires the consent of participants representing  85 percent of total NAB credit  arrangements of participants  eligible to vote and the approval  of the Executive Board. The  NAB was not activated at April 30, 2022, and 2021.  Drawings under the NAB can be made to finance purchases  by borrowing members for outright purchases and under  arrangements that were approved during the period when the NAB was activated. Claims under the NAB are encashable  on demand by participants, subject to certain conditions.  14.2  Bilateral Borrowing Agreements   Bilateral borrowing agreements are intended to serve as a third line of defense to IMF quotas and NAB resources. The  current round of bilateral borrowing agreements, which have been in effect since January 1, 2021, were signed under a framework established by the Executive Board in 2020. They  have an initial term through end-December 2023, which may  be extended by one more year, subject to creditor consent.   At April 30, 2022, lenders’  commitments under effective  borrowing agreements totaled US$185.6 billion, equivalent to  SDR 138.1 billion (US$193.9 billion equivalent to  SDR 135.0 billion at April 30, 2021).   Resources under bilateral borrowing agreements can be  activated only if the amount  of IMF resources otherwise  available for financing has fallen below a threshold of SDR 100 billion and either the NAB is activated or there are no available uncommitted NAB resources. Activation requires  approval by bilateral creditors r epresenting 85 percent of the  total credit amount committed.   Drawings under the borrowing agreements may be made to  finance purchases by borrowing members for outright  purchases and under arrangements that were approved during the period when the borrowing agreements were  activated. Claims under the bilateral borrowing agreements  are encashable on demand by lenders, subject to certain conditions.  14.3  Outstanding borrowings  Outstanding borrowings represent  drawings under the NAB,  are denominated in SDRs, and carry the SDR interest rate. There were no outstanding borrowings under bilateral  borrowing agreements at April 30, 2022, and 2021.  There were no drawings under the NAB or bilateral  borrowings during the financial years ended April 30, 2022,  and 2021. Repayments under the NAB during the same periods amounted to SDR 2,523 million and  SDR 3,765 million, respectively. Total outstanding NAB  borrowings at April 30, 2022, and 2021, were SDR 2,615  million and SDR 5,138 million, respectively (see Schedule 4).   The average interest rate on outstanding borrowings was  0.107 percent per annum and 0.077 percent per annum for  the financial years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021,  respectively.  The interest expense on outstanding borrowings  during the same periods was SDR 4 million and  SDR 6 million, respectively.  15.  Quota subscriptions and reserve tranche  positions  15.1  Quota subscriptions  The IMF’s resources are primarily provided by its members  through the payment of quota subscriptions, which broadly I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021     35 reflect each member’s relative position in the global  economy. Quotas also determine each member’s relative  voting power, its share in SDR allocations, and its access to  IMF resources.   The IMF conducts a general review of members’ quotas at  intervals of not more than five years. The review allows the  IMF to assess the adequacy of quota resources to meet its  needs and to allow for adjustments to members’ quotas to  reflect their relative positions in the world economy.   The Fourteenth General Review of Quotas became effective  in January 2016. At April 30, 2022, 187 members had  consented and paid in full their quota increases, amounting to SDR 238 billion (184 members at April 30, 2021,  amounting to SDR 238 billion) . This amount represents over  99 percent of the total quota increases that members were  eligible for at January 26, 2016 (SDR 239 billion). Quota subscription payments under the Fourteenth General Review  of Quotas during the years e nded April 30, 2022, and 2021,  amounted to SDR 0.5 billion and SDR 2 million, respectively.  The Fifteenth General Review of  Quotas was concluded in  February 2020 with no increase in IMF quotas. The Sixteenth  Review is planned to be concluded no later than  December 15, 2023.  On October 16, 2020, the Princi pality of Andorra became the  190 th member of the IMF wit h an initial quota of  SDR 83 million, which was paid in full during the financial  year ended April 30, 2021.  15.2  Reserve tranche positions  The reserve tranche is determined as the difference between the member’s quota subscription and the GRA’s holdings of its currency, excluding holdings that reflect the member’s use  of GRA credit and administrative balances. A member’s  reserve tranche is also considered a part of its international  reserves and a liquid claim against the GRA that can be  encashed by the member at any time upon the representation of a balance of payments need.    Members’ reserve tranche positions were as follows:    April 30, 2022 April 30, 2021   (in millions of SDRs )  Quota subscriptions 476,272 475,808  Total currency holdings 454,718 458,656  Less: GRA credit outstanding (93,031) (89,788)  Less: administrative balances (161) (167)   361,526 368,701  Reserve tranche positions 114,746 107,107  16.  Reserves of the General Resources Account  16.1  Reserves of the General Resources Account  The GRA reserves consist of the Special Reserve and the  General Reserve. The General Reserve may be used inter  alia to meet capital losses and operational deficits or for  distribution to IMF members. The Special Reserve can be  used for the same purposes except distribution to members. At April 30, 2022, the balanc es of Special and General  Reserves amounted to SDR 13,692 million and SDR 12,832 million, respectively (SDR 11,347 million and SDR 12,003 million, respectively, at April 30, 2021).   16.2  Income disposition  The Executive Board determines annually what part of the GRA net income (as described below) will be placed to the General Reserve and/or the Special Reserve, and what part,  if any, will be distributed. Net losses are charged against the  Special Reserve in accordance with an Executive Board  decision.   The GRA net income/losses for the purpose of the income  disposition includes: (i) total income of the GRA; (ii) transfer  from the IA as approved by the Executive Board; and (iii) the  remeasurement of net assets/ liabilities under retirement  benefit plans. For the financia l years ended April 30, 2022,  and 2021, the Executive Board decided to place income to/charge losses against reserves as follows:   Special Reserve  General Reserve    Income Remea- surement Total Income Remea- suremen tTotal    (in millions of SDRs)  Balance at      April 30, 2021 10,842 505 11,347 10, 983 1,020 12,003  Income of the  GRA 830 — 830 829 — 829  Transfer from the IA — — — — — —  Remeasurement of net assets/liabilities  under retirement  benefit plans — 1,515 1,515 — — —  Balance at    April 30, 2022 11,672 2,020 13,692 11,812 1,020 12,832   I.

Charges and fees   The average credit outstanding subject to charges amounted  to SDR 90,522 million and SDR 86,700 million for the financial years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively.   The rate of charge levied on outstanding credit is equal to the  basic rate of charge adjusted for burden-sharing (see  Note 13). The basic rate of charge is the SDR interest rate  plus a fixed margin as determined by the Executive Board, which for the years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021,  amounted to 100 basis points. The average rate of charge  (adjusted for burden-sharing) was 1.107 percent per annum  and 1.077 percent per annum for the financial years ended  April 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively.  Credit outstanding in excess of 187.5 percent of quota  resulting from purchases in the credit tranches and under the  EFF and the SLL is subject to a level-based surcharge of  200 basis points per annum above the basic rate of charge.  An additional time-based surcharge of 100 basis points per  annum applies to such credit outstanding for more than three years, except for purchases under the EFF, for which the  additional surcharge of 100 basis points applies after 51 months. Purchases under the SLL are not subject to time-based surcharges given the short maturity of repurchase  obligations.  Charges income consisted of the following:    During the year ended April 30, 2022, the IMF did not have  overdue charges to defer. The deferred charges during the  year ended April 30, 2021, amounted to SDR 2 million (see  Note 13.1) and were fully recovered through the proceeds from burden-sharing adjustments to charges and  remuneration of SDR 1 million each (see also Note 18).   Other charges and fees cons isted of the following:   2022  2021   (in millions of SDRs)  Service charges  71 115  Commitment fee 283 70  Special charges 88 —  Total charges  442 185    A service charge of 50 basis points is levied by the GRA on  all purchases from the GRA, except for purchases under SLL arrangements, which are subject to a service charge of  21 basis points, and reserve tranche purchases, which are  not subject to service charges.   A commitment fee is levied on the amount available for  financing under an arrangement for each 12-month period  and refunded as the member makes purchases under the  arrangement. Except for SLL arrangements, the commitment  fee amounts to 15 basis points per annum for access up to 115 percent of quota, 30 basis points for access between  115 and 575 percent of quota, and 60 basis points for access  in excess of 575 percent of quota. For SLL arrangements,  the commitment fee amounts to 8 basis points and is not  refundable when the member makes purchases under the  arrangement. At the expiration or cancellation of a GRA arrangement any unrefunded amount is recognized as  income, except for SLL arrangements for which commitment  fee income is recognized on a straight-line basis during the  duration of the arrangement.  The GRA levies special charges on overdue repurchases  and charges of less than six mont hs’ duration. Currently, the  special rate of charge on overdue repurchases is set at zero and for overdue charges it is equal to the SDR interest rate.

The business enterprise  can, as a result,  create variations of how to approach the  new complex and changing situations of success in the market. Therefore managers are trying  during negative times to  change their management approach, to ensure long -term and stable  running of the business enterpri se. They are forced to continuously maintain and obtain  customers and suppliers. By implementing these measures they have the opportunity to achieve  a competitive advantage over other business enterprises .     Key words     Financial analysis, company, profit , activity, profitability, liquidity, indebtedness     INTRODUCTION   In a global market economy that is determined by its constant uncertainty, the business  enterprises  are faced with  demanding economic conditions . They are exposed to constant  changes of environment as well as uncompromised pressure of competitors, who are trying  every day to increase the quality of their products and services and continuously to progress  ahead. This fact results in a negative impact  on the whole performance of the business subject.   The business subject, in order to be able to maintain a stable and competitive position on  the market, to provide inputs for the management, to make important strategic decisions and to  achieve their econo mic goals, is forced to constantly analyse  and monitor their financial  situation with which appears towards financial subjects and the surrounding’s situation. A  principal factor of effective financial management consist  SLOVAK UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY  in Bratislava , s of financial situation knowledge. For this purpose the financial analysis is used.  With it the business subject will be capable to prevent the crisis, which would lead to  remediation or even to bankruptcy.  74     OBJECTIVE     The objective of this ar ticle is to provide  basic knowledge about financial analysis ex -post  and subsequently to evaluate the business subject progress in an area of activity, liquidity  profitability and indebtedness, to reveal strengths and opportunities that the business subject  should rely on . Furthermore, it also aims to  determine weaknesses and threats that could lead  them to difficult situations and based on the results to provide measures to improve the system  of financial economic analysis of the business subject.     METHODS     In th is article the basic scientific methods used were  analysis, synthesis, induction,  deduction and hypothesis  creation . A synthesis of theory and knowledge will serve to obtain  the theoretical basis to meet the set objective. The analysis will f ocus on the financial statements  of a public limited company w hich produc es equipment and components for the mining,  chemical and energy industries, as well as boat and marine components. From the results of the  analysis , by induction, deduction and hypoth esis creation, we shall draw conclusions and  suggest actions for improvement of the business subject’s financial and economic analysis  system.     1. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF THE SELECTED COMPANY     The financial situation of the business subject is considered to be  a complex output of their  whole performance. This output is presented through the ratio indicators of activity,  profitability, liquidity, indebtedness and market value. These indicators are based on the  synthetic indicators of financial accounting and they  demonstrate the complexity of the business  subject’s performance interpretation  (Baran  and Pastýr , 2014, 6) .    1.1 Financial analysis  - Ex post   A financial situation analysis is the foundation of the company’s economic performance  analysis and usually proceeds down to primary fields and results as effectivity, efficiency,  production capacity utilisation , supplement management and the like. Financial analysis detect s  weaknesses  and strengths of the comp any, is the tool of “health” diagnostics and provides  essential information to business management and to owners (Vlachynský, 2009, 369) .  Sedláček understands the financial analysis of the company as a method of the company’s  financial management evaluatio n, during  which the data obtained is graded, aggregated  and  compared to each other . Furthermore,  the relationships between them are quantified, looking  for the causal connection between the data and their development  is determined . This increases  the explanatory power of data processing and its informative value. Thus it focuses on  identifying problems, strengths, weaknesses and foremost the company’s value processes.  Information obtained through financial analysis enables us to re ach some conclusions about  general management and the financial situation of the company and represents a background  for management decision making (Sedláček, 2009, 3) .   The main purpose of financial analysis is to express assets and the financial position  of the  company and to prepare the inputs for internal management decision making. The c omplexity  and continuous execution are the essential requirements of financial analysis (Hrdý, 2009, 118) . 75   The c ompany’s financial situation is diverse and a multifacet ed complex phenomenon;  consequently this diversity is transferred also into the financial analysis process. The user of  the financial analysis results decides which  indicator’s to select and the priority of utili sation of  individual parts of the financial analysis according to demand and intention (Baran et. al , 2011) .  Among primary users of the financial analysis we might include various subjects mainly  as  owners, managers, employees, lenders (suppliers, banks), debtors (customers), institutions  of state and public administration, external analytics, media and etc (Baran, 2008) .  The review of the company’s financial situation is declared by the system of financial  indicators, which have to be in order and designed to reflect all the important aspects of the  financial situation. Therefore, for a description of the financial situation the ratio indicators are  used. The ratio indicators enable a comparative  analys is of the company with other companies  or with indicators for the relevant area. The s um of ratio indicators we’ll present, can be  considered as the sum of representative indicators. Specifically, these will be the most  commonly used indicat ors of the financial situation  characteristics . However, along with the  practical application , dozens of indicators are used, and it is not possible to mention  all of them  (Baran, 20 15).   In practice , the use of several basic indicators has been proven rel evant which can be  categorised  into groups according to individual areas of management evaluation and the  financial health of the company. Mostly these are groups of indicator s such  as debt, liquidity,  profitability, activity, capital market indicators, as well as other indicators (Knapková, 2013,  84).  Based on the objectives that have been set within this article, we’ll provide more detail on  the ratio indicator s of profitability an d liquidity.     1.1.1 Financial analysis - Indicators of activity   The activity indicators are used for business asset management, because they evaluate how  effectively a business subject manages their assets . A business subject rates the commitment of  indivi dual items of the capital in certain forms of assets . If the business subject may have more  assets  than is appropriate , then unnecessary costs are incur red and the profit is adjusted. In  contrast , if the business subject may have few assets  the possible in comes may be lost  (Baran,  2015) .  When applying indicators of activity we see a problem in the work with flows and stocks.  While the balance sheet represents assets and liabilities at a particular point in time, the profit  and loss statement records the cos ts and revenues continuously over the year. Therefore, when  working with those indicators it is necessary due to the least possible deviation from the actual  that the calculation shows the average of individual balance sheets items (Pastýr , 2014 ).  The t ime of stock turnover testifies how many days does a stock turnover take. In other  words, it indicates the time that is required for the transition of financial resources through  production and products back into the form of money. The ideal situation is w hen the business  subject over time shows a decreasing value of this indicator. A short time (time scale) is usually  the expression of greater efficiency. However, it is necessary to take into account the nature of  the business. Alternatively, in the denomi nator instead of revenues the costs can be used.     stock  turnover =average  stock revenuesx 365   76   The receivables turnover tells how long the business assets hang in the form of receivables  or in how long time the receivables are paid on average. The recommend ed value is obviously  the standard time period of invoices maturity, because most of the consigned products are  invoiced and each invoice has its maturity. If the time period of receivables turnover has been  longer than the standard time period of invoices  maturity that would mean failure to comply  with the trade credit policy from business partners. However, at present it is quite common that  the time of invoices payment exceeds the declared. Definitely, in this case it is important to take  into considerat ion what is the size of the analysed  company. For small businesses the longer  period of receivables maturity may cause significant financial issues with the possibility of  bankruptcy. While large businesses are from the financial point of view more able to  tolerate  longer period of maturity. The time horizon, which could be considered as optimal, should also  meet the criteria of business commercial policy (Růčková, 2005, 122) .    receivables  turnover =average  stock  of short −term  receivables revenuesx 365    The maturity of short -term liabilities reflects the time of incurrence until its payment. This  indicator should reach at least the values of receivables turnover maturity. The indicators of  receivables turnover maturity and the liabilities turnover maturit y are important for assessing  the timing differences from the inception of receivables until their collections and from  incurring of liabilities until the payment. This difference directly influences the business  liquidity. As far as the turnover , the time of commitment is greater than the sum of stock and  receivables turnover, the suppliers credits finance receivables and stock, which  is preferable.  However, it may reflect low liquidity levels. Between the level of liquidity and activity is a  close connect ion and a certain compromise should be looked for (Knapková, 2013, 105) .    liabilities  turnover =average  stock  of short −term  liabilities revenuesx 365    The long -term asset  turnover is relevant in decision -making to determine whether to procure  the next long-term production asset. A lower value of the indicator than the average in the field  is a signal for production to increase capacity utili sation and for financial managers to reduce  business investments (Sedláček, 2001,  61).     long −term  asset  turnover =revenue average  stock  of long −term  assets    In general , with  asset  turnover , it applies that the larger the value of the indicator, the more  positively the situation is asse ssed. A minimal recommended value of this indicator is 1. Yet  the value is influenced  by the industry as well. A low value of indicator means a  disproportionate business subject’s asset facilities and its inefficient use (Knapková, 2013,  104).    asset  turnover =revenues average  stock  of assets    In this case, it is possible to substitute the r evenues with the profits, though the result may be  overestimated due to different types of income that are not related to the main business activity. 77   It is appropriate to use the sale or revenues from the sales of  ones own products and services or  to combi ne both kinds of profits (Knapková, 2013, 104) .    1.1.2 Financial analysis - Indicators of profitability     The indicators of profitability, sometimes referred to as indicators of profit, return,  profitability ratio, are designed as a ratio of the final effect achieved by business activity  (output) to some comparative base (input) that can be on the side of assets  as well as on the side  of liabilities , or to another base. These indicators display the positive or also negative influence  on asset  management, the business subject’s financing and liquidity on profitability  (Kislingerová, 2007, 83) .  All indicators of profitability have a similar interpretation, because they specify how much  EUR of revenues (the numerator) cases per 1 EUR of i ndicator mentioned in the denominator.  Because there exists a multitude of profitability ratio indicators; we’ll address only those that  are the most important. Altogether we’ll approach the explanatory power of selected and  mentioned indicators. In this a rticle we’ll mention the following, in practice most frequently  used indicators of profitability (Baran, 2015) .  A return on sales indicator explains to us, how is the business subject able to use inputs for  their effective operations. The final value of this indicator is directly influenced by the character  of the business activity, price policy, production regulation, etc. A more accurate statement of  this type of indi cator provides us a ratio of partial results of the business subject’s management  to their revenues (Baran, 201 5).    return  on sales =net income income x 100  operating  return  on sales =operating  profit income x 100    share  of added  value  in revenues =added  value income x 100    The profitability indicator (return of income) of total capital compares the result of business  activity with the volume of invested capital (Farkašová, 2007, 42) . This indicator specifies the  assessment of total capital, the business subject  has used for their activity. By assessment of the  capital part of the equity, is a process of profit distribution after tax. It is possible for the  business subject to execute the profit distribution after tax, but not until the general assembly  approves the following:   - to increase capital,   - to subsidi se funds from revenues,   - to retain the profit after tax undistributed or   - to repay dividends (in the case of plc).   By valori sation of capital, the business subject is commissioned to pay back part of the  capital  to the lender. Professional literature states an indicator level reference not to be higher  than the interest rate of long -term loans.     return  on assets  (ROA )=net profit assets x 100   78   A return on equity is essential for the business subject’s owners and for lenders has a  supporting meaning. In general , the value of indicators should be higher than the interest rate  of risk -free bonds (Černá, 1997, 73) .     return  on equity  (ROE )=net profit equity x 100    The level of return on equity is strongly dependent on the return on assets and on the interest  rate of borrowed capital. The increase of the indicator ROE mostly depends on the level of the  business subject’s created profit, on a drop in interest rate of the borrowed capital, on a decline  in the equity’s share on a business subject’s return on assets and a combination of all previous  factors (Baran, 201 5).    1.1.3 Financial analysis - Indicator of liquidity   Liquidity is a combination  of all potential liquid resources that are available for the  company to meet their payment obligations. According to professional literature solvency is  defined as the readiness of the business subject to undertake payment of their obligations at the  time of their reimbursement and therefore is one of the basic conditions of the company’s  successful existence (Sedláček, 2009, 66) .   We can conclude that there exists mutual conditioning of liquidity indicators and solvency.  The condition of solvency is to att ain that the business subject would have part of the assets  bond ed to the available assets, which are disposable to obligations for reimbursement in the  form of short -term financial asset s- mostly bank accounts. Furthermore , we are able to conclude  that th e condition of solvency is liquidity. The indicators of liquidity are put into the ratio : the  individual short -term financial assets against short -term obligations. Indicators of liquidity  engage into the most liquid part of the business subject’s assets  and are divided according to  level of liquidity of individual assets , which are mentioned in the numerator of financial  statements - the balance sheet. The disadvantage of indicators is that these indicators evaluate  liquidity according to balances of short -term asset s (current assets) which on the other hand  mainly depends on future cash -flow (Baran  and Pastyr , 2014, 9) .  Liquidity of the 1st level shows, how many times the short -term financial asset s (current  assets ) covers the  short -term obligations of the business subject. This means, how many times  is the business subject able to satisfy their lenders, if they would convert some of the short -  term asset s (current assets) items instantly into available assets (Baran, 2015, 10) .   For the success of the company it is essential to pay short -term obligations from those  assets  that are designated for this purpose (Valach, 1999, 109) . The 1st level liquidity indicator  has its meaning foremost for the lenders of business subject’s short -term obligations and  provides information of the extent to which the short -term components of capital (borrowed  capital) covers the value of the asset, because lenders undertake some risk, which is, that their  claim won’t be reimbursed. The higher the value of the 1st level liqu idity indicator is, in general,  the more likely is the business subject’s solvency is ensured.   This characteristic is only really a rough sketch, because it s explanatory ability further  depends on the current assets structure, liquidity of individual kind s of current assets and as  well on the type of industry the company operates in (Valach, 1999, 109) .    1st level  liquidity  =current  financial  assets short −term  foreign  sources   79   For coverage of the business subject’s short -term obligations , can be used the immediate  financial resources that are available on bank accounts and in treasury as well as expected  financial resources of not yet refunded short -term obligations. This relationship gives us  liquidity of the 2nd level. As professional li terature states, the recommended values should be  located within interval 1 - 1.5.       2nd  level  liquidity  =current  financial  assets +short −term  obligations short −term  foreign  sources    Liquidity of the 3rd level determines  the ability of the company to pay their obligations to  short -term borrowed capital throug h the current asset s. This means that the company does have  enough short -term resources to manage their regular operation. The optimal i nterval is 1.5 to a  max of 2.5 and in comparison t o the liquidity of 1st or 2nd level is increased for the reasons of  lower liquidity of supplies. The short -term borrowed capital shouldn’t exceed 40 % of the  current asset value  (Kotulič, 2010, 60) .    3rd level  liquidity =current  assets short −term  foreign  sources    Current asset s includes the sum of current financial asset s, short -term receivables and  supplies. Permanent solvency is one of the basic conditions of the business subject’s successful  existence within the market conditions. Thus, the probability of  its maintenance is a reasonable  part of the global characteristic of the business subject’s financial health.      1.1.4 Financial analysis - Horizontal liquidity   A very important task within liquidity analysis is horizontal liquidity. The horizontal  liquidity examines the mutual context and relations among items of assets and items of capital  in financial statements - the balance sheet. The c urrent asset s of the business subject should be  covered by short -term resou rces (Baran  and Pastyr , 2014, 8) .    1.1.4.1 Golden statistic rule   Every kind of asset should be financed by the source of the asset with the reimbursement  period (liquidity) that corresponds to the period of effective use of relevant asset. This fact is  considered as the basic finance management rule and is called the golden statistic rule  (Šlosárová, 2006, 351) .  The golden statistic rule requires that the source coverage of long -term asset s (LA) is long- term sources coverage (LC). This means that the financial resources won’t be available for  shorter than the commitment of equity participation, for which this serves. A relationship  between long -term asset s and long - term sources can be in this case t hreefold (Kotulič, 2010):    LC < LC, or LA – LC < 0 => company is pre -financed,    LA > LC, or LA – LC > 0 => company is under -financed,    LA = LC, or LA – LC = 0 => company asset s are optimally financed.   Balance equilibrium, which has to be preserved in the balance sheet, results in these  relationships having an  effect on the current asset s and its finance. The c urrent asset s (CA)  should be covered mostly by current sources (CS). The difference between CA and CS is called  a NET working capital.  80   1.1.4.2 NET working capital   The net working capital is an indicator, which reconstructs part of the current asset s  (current assets ) that is financed by long -term financial resources, either by equity or by  borrowed capital. The business subject’s net working capital e nables in theory a case that the  business subject in real time is obligated to reimburse a significant proportion of their short - term obligations, which form a meaningful source of their funding to further operate. The  overload of current asset s towards sh ort-term obligations demonstrates to us that the business  subject is from the point of view of current liquidity liquid. This means that the business subject  has a financial background in the form of long -term financial resources. (Baran, 2015)   NWC = curre nt assets  – short -term obligations   where NWC is the net working capital.   1.1.5 Financial analysis - Indicators of indebtedness   The term of indebtedness expresses the fact that the company finances their assets  by  foreign sources. By using foreign sources the company affects both the profitability of  shareholders as well as the business risk. Today, it’s practically pointless for large sized  companies to finance all their assets  from equity or vice versa only fro m foreign capital. By  using only equity would result in an overall return on invested capital reduction within the  company. On the other hand, financing of all business activities only by foreign capital is  excluded, because within the legal regulations a certain mandatory amount of equity to start a  business is bound. Therefore, in business finance  activities its own as well as foreign capital are  implicated. The main motive of financing their activities by foreign capital is the relatively low  price compa red to its own resources. The involvement of foreign sources in business financing  enables reduce costs for the use of capital in the company (Kislingerová, 2007, 96) .  Although the theory of refer red higher cost of equity compared to foreign capital is  questionable , at the present time of low interest rates it seems to be more advantageous to use   ones own equity unless the company or shareholders have it at their disposal.   The indicator of total indebtedness, which is expressed by the ratio of foreign sour ces to  overall assets  further expresses to what extent the assets of the company include foreign  sources. The creditors do not prefer too high a proportion of debt. Rather they favour a lower  proportion of debt. This gives them greater  assurance  that in th e case of the company’s  liquidation their receivables will be more likely satisfied. For the owners , the foreign sources  are less expensive than their own and at a higher debt rate the profitability of capital is increased.  The optimal value of this indica tor for the production company is 40  % up to 60  % (Farkašová,  2007, 39) .    total  indebtedness =foreign  sources assetsx 100    To measure the indebtedness , a ratio of equity to total assets is used.   - coefficient of self -financing, which is a complementary indicator ( self -financing) and their  sum with total indebtedness should give 100  %. This indicator expresses the proportion, in  which the assets  of the company are financed by shareholders’ finances. It is considered as  one of the most important ratios of indebtedness for the overall financial situation  assessment . Yet once again the relation ship with the profitability indicator is important   (Růčková, 200 5, 117) .  coefficient  of self −financing =equity assetsx 100 81   Insolvency notes the relation ship between items - assets and liabilities. If the resulting value  is greater than 1, it is a so -called primary insolvency and if the value is less than 1, we’re talking  about so -called secondary insolvency of the company (Farkašová, 2007 , 40).  insolvency =short −term  liabilities short −term  receiveblesx 100    Credit indebtedness is interpreted as a mutual relation ship between bank loans and  overdrafts in the numerator and fore ign sources located in the denominator. The resulting  relation ship is expressed in a percentage  (Pastýr , 2014 ).   credit  indebtedness =bank  loans  and overdrafts foreign  sourcesx 100  The indicator of interest coverage expresses the number of times the profit is higher than  the paid interest. Hence this indicator is used by the company to determine whether the debt  burden is feasible. It informs shareholders about the company’s ability to pay interests and  creditors about whether and how to ensure their rights in the case of the company’s liquidation.  The inability to pay the interests payments from the profit can predict approaching business  bankruptcy. If the value of this indicator re aches a value of 1, the entire profit would cover the  interest expense. Thus it is recommended that the value of the indicator is higher than 3 (Hrdý,  2009, 130) .    interest  coverage =economic  result  before  tax+interest  expense interest  expense    The indebtedn ess flow tells about the value of commitment in terms of total annual cash  flow of the company. This indirectly implies about the time required to cover the debts from  the annual perspective, where the entire value is considered 100  %. Usually it is requir ed that  the repayment of debt is not longer than 3 years (Farkašová, 2007,  40).    indebtedness  flow =foreign  sources cash  flow    The indebtedness is not always a negative characteristic  of the company. Nevertheless, the  higher the debt, the greater the business risk and the harder it is to obtain foreign sources of  financing foremostly to get a loan from a bank  (Šlosárová, 2006, 345) .    2. RESULTS AND DISCUSSI ON    In this chapter we interp ret the financial -economic analysis of assets , liquidity, profitability  and indebtedness , the golden statistic rule or the net working capital in the specific example of  the following business subject. The research consists of results from the calculations, graphs  and following the course and trend evaluation of the monitored indicators. The data for  financial -economic analysis has been derived from financial statements as the balance sheet,  and profit and loss account. For the cause of relevance we used the statements, reports dated  from 2009 till 2014.      82   2.1 Activity indicators of the monitored business subject     In the next subchapter we’ll look how a business subject manages  its assets and what is its  effectiveness. The exact values of the analysed  indicators and their development can be seen in  Table 1 and Graph 1 (see Tab. 1 and Graph 1 below).   Tab. 1  Indicators of activity    m. u.  2009  2010  2011  2012  2013  2014   Inventory turnover  day 102,41  87,69  113,29  105,36  83,75  90,16   Short -term receivables collection  period  day 88,77  76,01  98,20  91,32  72,60  78,16   The maturity of short -term liabilities  day 101,35  86,79  112,13  104,27  82,89  89,24   Fixed assets turnover  coef.  3,85 4,50 3,48 3,74 4,71 4,37  Total assets turnover  coef.  1,18 1,38 1,07 1,15 1,44 1,34  Source: (Pastýr, 2014,  72)    In graph 1 , the activity indicators of the monitored business subject are graphically shown.     Graph 1  Indicators of activity     Source: (Pastýr, 2014,  73)  The values of assets  turnover through the analysed  period  both increased and decreased .  The highest value the company recorded in 2013 i.e. 1.44. The weakest asset use of the business  subject has been reached in 2011 with the value 1.07. This result has been mostly affected by  an item production in progress and semi -finished products with the value € 3,418,601, which  entered in the following year the highest value € 20,425,932. With the decline of production in  progress als o the profits decreased, which in 2011 have been the lowest during the reporting  period. This implies that the business subject had during  this time issues with contracts, which  has been proved as well by employment decline from 477 to 307. In the last yea r the indicator  declined slightly due to the growth of long -term fixed asset s.  The long -term asset turnover has the same development as total assets  turnover, though the  differences between the values are greater. Fixed asset s had approximately the same va lue, but  is worth noting that in 2013 the value is € 8,719,077 and in 2014, the value is € 26,737,025.  The difference between them was due to constructions and separate movable assets and sets of  movable assets, which grew from the merge r of the analysed  business subject with SAM by the  E.S.C.B, Inc. Bratislava. The indicator reaches its lowest value in 2011 at 3.48. In this year, as  we already stated, the decline of profits from sales of their own products and services occurred.   0,0020,0040,0060,0080,00100,00120,00 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014Inventory turnover Short-term receivables collection period The maturity of short-term liabilities Fixed assets turnover Total assets turnover83   The indicator of the stock turnover time period has fluctuating values  by 6 months . The  peak was reached in 2011 of 113 days. This long stock turnover was been mainly caused by the  decline of material and production in progress and semi -finished products. In this year the  revenues d ecreased by about € 10,960,961. The ideal situation is to achieve the minimum of  this indicator, which occurred  in 2013, when the stock turnover amounted to 83.75 days.   The receivables and stock turnover time period show  similar trends . The lowest value was  reached in 2013, when the short -term receivables collection period was 72.60 days and maturity  of short -term liabilities was 82.89 days. In every reporting year we can see that the short -term  receivables collection had a lower value than the maturity of short -term liabilities. For the  business subject this state is of a positive nature, because it expresses that the customers repay  their debts before the business subject repays its liabilities.   2.2 Profitability indicators of the mon itored business subject     The indicators of profitability are designed as the business subject’s economic result rate  (output) to a comparative item (input). These indicators tell us at what level is the business  subject able to reach profit with the help of the capital  used. In table 2 (see Tab. 2 below) the  profitability indicators values are shown.      Tab. 2  Indicators of profitability    m. u.  2009  2010  2011  2012  2013  2014   Return on sales  % 1,77 2,55 4,54 13,98  11,18  11,68   Operating return  on sales  % 2,52 4,34 6,77 17,65  13,90  13,74   The share of value added in revenues  % 19,90  22,04  24,87  35,90  26,64  30,75   Return on assets (ROA)  % 2,65 3,36 6,46 12,15  16,50  14,03   Return on equity (ROE)  % 6,48 10,18  12,94  30,03  45,59  31,14   Source: (Pastýr, 2014, 71)     In graph 2 , the profitability indicators of the monitored business subject are graphically shown.     Graph 2  Indicators of profitability     Source: (Pastýr, 2014, 71)   0,005,0010,0015,0020,0025,0030,0035,0040,0045,0050,00 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014Return on sales Operating return on sales Share of added value in revenues Return on assets Return on equity84   The profitability indicator of return on sale interprets that the business subject has reached  a profit increase, which was highest in 2012 with the value 13.98 % . This was caused by a larger  amount of orders and subsequently the increase of supplies at the date of the report compilation.  In the following two years this value decreased due to a slight change of sales return state which  stabili sed to the level 11.18 % and 11.68 %.    The return on sale s shows a similar trend to the operating return on sale s. Until  2012 the  operating return on sale s has shown an increase , when the indicator reached almost 17.65 %  mainly due to the lower return on sale s of their own products and services and due to higher  profit from business activity  operations . In the last two years the income from operations  stabili sed yet the revenues incr eased, which caused the indicator to decrease to 13.90 % and to  13.74 %.   Once again, in 2012, the share of added value to revenues , displayed  the highest value  at  35.90 %, which for the business subject over the last  6 years was the most successful. Within  the next  two years , a lower value occurred mainly due to change of revenues size from the sale  of their products and services. The i ndicator shows  overall positive progress.   The p ositive profitability of the total ca pital reflects  the production power, and provides   details about the effective asset utili sation and thus the assets of the business subject. This  indicator has been increasing every year and the highest value reached in 2013 of 16.50 %. In  the following year, only a small decline to 14.03 % occurred mainly due to the merge r with a  minor business subject and due to the increase in fixed assets of land, buildings and non -fixed  assets.     Return on equity invested  by the owners into the business, reache d a positive value as well,  which is a positive signal for the business subject’s owners. It is worth not ing 2013, in which  the return on equity reached  the level of 45.59 %. This was caused by a decrease of retained  earnings, wh ich means, that the profit was r edistributed among owners of the public limited  company via dividends reimbursement.    In the latest  year the return on equity value declined to 31.14 % due to capital funds  subsid ies.    2.3 Liquidity indicators of the monitored business subject   The business subject’s ability to repay their obligations is a necessary factor for a long- term successful venture. Therefore constant monitoring is important by both the business  subject and by external users, who could cooperate with the business subject  or that already  cooperate with them. In table 3 (see Tab. 3 below) the values of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd level liquidity  indicators are shown.     Tab. 3  Indicators of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd level of liquidity    m. u  2009  2010  2011  2012  2013  2014   Liquidity of  1st level  coef.  0,15 0,14 0,31 0,23 0,04 0,07  Liquidity of  2nd level  coef.  0,69 0,97 1,68 0,51 0,87 0,52  Liquidity of  3rd level  coef.  1,68 2,00 2,85 1,40 1,20 0,89  Source: (Pastýr, 2014, 71)     Graph 3 shows the monitored business subject’s indicators for the  1st, 2nd and 3rd level of  liquidity.      85   Graph 3  Indicators of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd level of liquidity     Source: (Pastýr, 2014, 71)     According to the recommended range for engineering business subjects indicated by  professional literature the values of the 1st level of liquidity should vary from 0.2 to 0.6. When  looking at the table, it is visible that the values of the monitored business subject are ge nerally  much lower and they don’t reach the recommended value . This tells us about the business  subject’s inability to instantly refund their short -term obligations. The lowest rate that the  indicator has registered was during  the most recent two years, wh en the values reached 0.04  and 0.07 %. These low values were mainly caused by an increase of obligations from business  relations hips and an increase of obligations  towards the owners. Two exceptions can be taken  as a positive fact and that is 2011 with a value of 0.31 and 2012 with a value of 0.23.  The 2nd  level of liquidity should vary within an  interval of 1-1.5. Within this range only the value 1.68  achieved in 2011 is located. In recent years , the values were lower than the interval limit 1. The  lowest value 0.51 was reached in 2012. This value was largely influenced by accruals, more  accurately, by short - term deferred revenues, which reached up 17  400 198 €. From these values  we can assume that the business s ubject besides in 2011 didn’t have the ability to refund their  short -term obligations with their short -term receivables. Also in the case of a need to repay their  short -term obligations the business subject would have to proceed with a change of less liqui d  asset s to more liquid asset s. For the  3rd level of liquidity the business subject’s supplies were  included. The r ecommended values should vary between  2 and 2.5. Within this range falls 2010  with the value 2 and 2011 with the value up to 2.85. For some p ositive fact we can consider  that the business subject has their 3rd level liquidity over the value of 1, which creates a situation,  in which they are able to repay their short -term obligations with their current asset s. The  indicator’s lowest value is achieved by the business subject in 2014 at 0.89 due to changes of  several items of production in the progress decline, blank stock, business relation ship  receivables, the increase in other current reserves and liabilities  towards partners.     2.4 Horizontal liquidity of the monitored business subject   In the following part of the article we  will outline  the achieved values of different  indicators, the golden statistic rule and the net working capital of the business subject.       0,000,501,001,502,002,503,00 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014Liquidity of  1st level Liquidity of  2nd level Liquidity of  3rd level86   2.4.1 Golden statistic rule   In table 4 (see Tab. 4 below) the values of the golden statistic rule indicator of the monitored  business subject for each year are shown.

This indicates that they have mor e long -term  resources as fixed asset that is owned by the business subject.   Given the fact that the business subject disposes of approximately the same fixed asset  value, the size of difference is conditional mostly on equity development and by accruals. T he  highest negative value was reached by the business subject in 2010 due to a high level item of  deferred long -term earnings. From this year the value of the golden statistic rose slightly. In the  latest year the indicator’s value reached a negative value due to the merge r of the monitored  business subject with a minor business subject, resulting in high growth of fixed asset s mostly  in the form of buildings and non -fixed assets.        2.4.2 Net working capital   In table 5 (see below Tab. 5 below) the indicator values of net working capital  by the  monitored business subject for each year are listed.      -20 000 000-15 000 000-10 000 000-5 000 00005 000 00010 000 00015 000 00020 000 00025 000 000 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014Fixed assets Long- term obligations Golden statistic rule87   Tab. 5  Indicator s of net working capital     2009  2010  2011  2012  2013  2014   CA 19 403 638 28 020 007  17 872 437  37 793 178  25 639 724  18 248 631   SO 11 580 734  14 044 305  6 279 600  27 077 378  21 365 752  20 445 240   CA- SO=NWC  7 822 904  13 975 702  11 592 837  10 715 800  4 273 972  -2 196 609   Source: own research   In graph 5 the indicator development of net working capital by the monitored business subject  is graphically displayed.     Graph 5  Indicator s of net working capital     Source: own research   From the viewpoint of a comparison with net working capital we can state that NWC has  a natural reverse correlation  with the golden statistic rule. In the business subject until 2012 ,  current asset s exceeded short -term obligations. This fact from the business subject’s point of  view is judged as positive, because in the case of necessity , the business subject is able to  reimburse their obligations by current asset s, which testifies of their good financial situation.  According to graph 5 we can conclude that this value from 2010 decreases due to the decline  of incomplete production and blank stock. In 2012, 2013 and 2014 the decline is also caused  by the increase of business relation ship obligations. In the last reporting  year,  2014 , the net  working capital reached  negative values. Based on this , arises slight ly unfunded debt, wh ich is  for the business subject a warning signal, because in the need for repay ment  of short -term  obligations, they would be forced to sell part of their fixed asset s and thereby would be forced  to influence the business subject’s operations.     2.5 Indebtedness indicators of monitored business subject   By means of these indicators, we look at the financial structure and indebtedness of the  business subject and its indeb tedness repayment ability. The results are shown in table 6 below.

Graph 6 Indicators of indebtedness     Source: (Pastýr, 2014 , 74)  Total assets indebtedness during our 6 year reporting period showed  a fluctuating character.  Their values are in the range from 50.08 up to 67.01. For the optimal total indebtedness is  considered the value 50  %. The company was the closest to this point in 2011 with the value  50.08. They were the most in debt in 2012 with the value 67.01 mainly due to the increase of  time differentiation or profits from future long -term periods.   The coefficient of self -financing is directly related to total assets  indebtedness, which  assesses the field from the point of view of the company’s owners and its sum is  made of                     100 %. Thus its development is the opposite and equally volatile to total asset  indebtedness.  The business subject was the most financially independent in 2011 with 49.92 .   Immediately in the first reporting year the indicator o f insolvency ha d the highest value of 2.04,  from which we can judge that the business subject had issues surrounding  its own activity,  whereas its liabilities to receivables were  higher by more than twice and it s the initial insolvency  mainly due to short -term trade receivables. The business subject entered secondary insolvency  in 2011, when the indicator’s value was 0.91 due to a slight increase of short -term receivables  and decrease of short -term liabilities from trade.   In 2012 the credit indebtedness was a  decreasing trend. The highest financing of foreign  sources through bank loans was reported  in the first reporting year of 2009 with 19.14  %. In  2012 they reached the lowest value of only 0.80  % due to an increase of time differentiation  item profits from future long -term periods.   The interest coverage after 2013 showed an increasing trend . Its value increases  exponentially, which can also be seen on the graph. In 2009 this indicator reached the value  only of 3.94, wh ich was caused by low pre-tax trading income and higher interest expense. In  2013 this indicator increased to 105.71 and in 2013 to a value of 244.30, which was mainly due  to high trade income before tax and low interest expense. This implies that the company covers  their interests with its  profit without any issues.   The indebtedness flow has a fluctuating trend . In 2009 and 2010 this indicator increases to  the value of 11.50. Afterwards  the indicator’s decline until 2013, when the business subject  0,0050,00100,00150,00200,00250,00 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014Total debt assets Coefficient of self- financing Credit indebtedness Interest coverage Flow debt89   would pay its liabilities (debts) at the fo rmation of cash flow of 3.31 per year. Already in the  last reporting year only a slight decrease occurred .    3. PROPOSAL FOR IMPROVE MENTS OF MONITORED B USINESS SUBJECT´S  SELECTED RATIO INDICATORS OF  FINANCIAL -ECONOMIC ANALYSIS     After the processing of financial -economic analysis several weaknesses of the business  subject have been revealed. In the synthesis of this information and following induction we can  generali se some measures for long - term successful operation of the business subjec t. It is the  incorporation of the following measures.     3.1 The activity ratio indicator of the monitored business subject   At the time of stock turnover we propose continuous stock monitoring to prevent the  adverse ly high inventory. As well in the future we propose some optimi sation of stock flow  management in relation to production or its improved procurement from various suppliers,  storage and use through a precise time system, motion planning in parallel with produ ction  needs.   The time of short -term receivables collection can enable further possible business  development within fair trade and good customer -supplier relationships . I see the possibility of  improvement or the volume and frequency of short - term receivab les reduction as well as the  time period of their reimbursement in the incentives of customers themselves through the  provision of cash discount, price discounts for payment before the due date of the relevant  receivable and thereby ensuring stabili sation or receivables turnover time reduction.   A further possibility to decrease the short -term receivables collection is to introduce a strict  internal control system in issuing e.g. customer invoices in the form of rescheduling.   To ensure the timely payment of  receivables of less responsible customers it is necessary  to apply the reminders notice mechanism or sanctioning for non -compliance of contractual  conditions of payment.   In the case of receivables management improvement the acquired financial sources cou ld  be used to reduce the size as well as the short -term liabilities time period of the business subject  from trade by invoice reimbursement from their suppliers to maturity or sooner, or reducing the  need to use short - term bank loans.   The long - term asset  turnover has significant different values, thus I recommend that the  business subject uses their long -term asset s more effectively.   By decreasing the stock turnover time period ensures the greater production flexibility,  because the high volume of stocks  binds unnecessary finances that could be invested into other  business areas e.g. into its development, moderni sation and etc.   By reducing the short - term receivables time period through using a cash discount or price  discounts for payment before maturity of the receivable will lead to a  decline of unliquidated  short -term receivables in the business subject. This allows further use of cashed financial  sources e.g. the earlier payment of short -term liabilities of the business subject or reducing the  need to use short -term bank loans. In the supplier this motivational tool can induce the  willingness on his part to closer cooperat e under favourable  conditions. The introduction of an  internal control system in issuing of customer invoices timeliness and excellen ce may ensured  this. 90   The decline of the short -term liabilities time period or proper and timely payment of  liability to a supplier can creat e between him and the business subject a favourable  and  competitive supplier -customer relationship that can be in the future reflected e.g. in material  supply for more favourable  quantitative and price conditions.     3.2 The profitability ratio indicator of the monitored business subject   We can state that th e results of profitability indicators have positive values. That means the  business subject achieves continuous profit. Almost all these indicators in a period of six years  achieved within the recent two years a slight downward trend. The interests of the business  subject is to stabili se or to increase these values. Therefore a continuous monitoring of  indicators of sales and profit  is required , to increase the level of these indicators. These  objectives can be achieved by the following measures:    by a flexible pricing policy,    by improving the efficiency of the marketing mix,    by efforts to win new customers and cheaper suppliers,    by investing in financial market products for example in bonds and funds.   On the other hand, to prevent further decline of the business subject’s profit, it is required  to secure the economy and efficiency by optimi sation of costs and by individual asset items  utilisation. It is mainly the following cost items:    the cost of material and energy consumption,   - by applying new prod uction technologies and the use of new or innovated  technology,    - by improving work organi sation and production management in the form of  production process harmoni sation, production capacity utili sation,   - by raising the educational level of employees,    the reduction of personnel costs,   - by standardi sed work of production employees,   - by optimi sation of overhead employees,   - by optimi sation of technical and administrative employees.     Following the introduction of design measures there is a premise of the business subject s  economic result increase for the accounting period as well as the increase of the revenue  indicator s. The business subject will accomplish a stabili sed position on the market by obtaining  new and more advantageous financial relationships.  As well higher profitability and more  efficient capital utili sation for business subject’s owners will be accomplished by reali sation of  the mentioned measures.   By optimi sation of costs the business subject will secure their decrease and at the same  time will create conditions for the implementation of innovative and new technologies and  techni ques that should be introduced  to employees on the appropriate educational level.     3.3 The ratio and differential liquidity indicator of the monitored business subje ct  In 2012 , the value of the golden statistic rule indicator for the monitored business subject  registered growth due to the merge r of two business subjects and the growth of current asset s.  The value of this indicator thus reached a  positive value that means the business subject is  under -financed. As a result of this adverse situation, three  ways of this value reduction are  proposed:  91    by increase  of their fixed resources of settlement by raising their equity through basic  capital incr ease in the form of share issue,    by bond issue,    by increase of their external sources through obtaining of long -term bank loan.   Within the monitored business subject the current asset s exceeds short -term obligations.  The exception of this is the latest yea r, therefore we propose towards the future period to  increase the business subject ’s liquidity by increasing the volume of their current financial  asset s:   by reducing the time of debt collection from business relations (by discount, by  monitoring, by mecha nism of reminders, by penalties),    by reduction of supplement turnover time (better supplement management),    by advance charge on customi sed production,    by sale of surplus asset s, but this asset change could result in a lower ability for further  business activities development in the future.     After the implementation of submitted proposals for increas ing the business subject’s  liquidity, there is the premise of a business subject’s solvency increase while the conditions for  balanced development are created. The business subject will have the necessary financial  resources and will be able to reimburse on time their short -term obligations with their financial  resources as well as be able to use them for further development.     3.4 The indebtedness ratio indicator of the monitored business subject   Undertaking in relation to business activity , the business subject has acceptable values of  total indebtedness as well as the self -financing coefficient, thus I do recommend to monitor,  maintain and not to exceed  this state or this indebtedness rate.   Regarding the insolvency indicator the business subject is primarily located in insolvency,  therefore I recommend that the business subject shall try to reduce the level of a short -term  liabilities.   After the incorpo ration of measures the level of equity and foreign capital will stabili se and  the overall stability will be ensured. The business subject will seem more attractive in the  provision of loans as well as in individual investments.     CONCLUSION     In the present turbulent competitive environment the financial analysis is an essential part  of monitoring the business subject and is an important tool to support the decision making of  various stakeholder groups. Also it provides a picture or feedback about the whole c ondition of  business subject and their development and about a condition of individual operation areas.  This analysis is able to identify factors that with the largest stake have caused undesirable  results within the business subject. Through prediction mo dels of financial -economic analysis  the business subject is able to predict their future development and possible option for  bankruptcy.   Among the benefits of this article belongs financial -economic analysis focused on the  business subject’s ratio indicato rs of activity, profitability, liquidity and indebtedness itself.   Related proposals mentioned in this article for weaknesses elimination which  were found by  financial analysis are focused on practical use in the business subject’s experience.     92   Note   The contribution was written within the framework of a research project VEGA 1/0218/16 on  ""The Model of the implementation of controlling as a management tool within medium  enterprises in the engineering and electronics industries"".

They are exposed to constant  changes of environment as well as uncompromised pressure of competitors, who are trying  every day to increase the quality of their products and services and continuously to progress  ahead. This fact results in a negative impact  on the whole performance of the business subject.   The business subject, in order to be able to maintain a stable and competitive position on  the market, to provide inputs for the management, to make important strategic decisions and to  achieve their econo mic goals, is forced to constantly analyse  and monitor their financial  situation with which appears towards financial subjects and the surrounding’s situation. A  principal factor of effective financial management consist  SLOVAK UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY  in Bratislava , s of financial situation knowledge. For this purpose the financial analysis is used.  With it the business subject will be capable to prevent the crisis, which would lead to  remediation or even to bankruptcy.  74     OBJECTIVE     The objective of this ar ticle is to provide  basic knowledge about financial analysis ex -post  and subsequently to evaluate the business subject progress in an area of activity, liquidity  profitability and indebtedness, to reveal strengths and opportunities that the business subject  should rely on . Furthermore, it also aims to  determine weaknesses and threats that could lead  them to difficult situations and based on the results to provide measures to improve the system  of financial economic analysis of the business subject.     METHODS     In th is article the basic scientific methods used were  analysis, synthesis, induction,  deduction and hypothesis  creation . A synthesis of theory and knowledge will serve to obtain  the theoretical basis to meet the set objective.

From the results of the  analysis , by induction, deduction and hypoth esis creation, we shall draw conclusions and  suggest actions for improvement of the business subject’s financial and economic analysis  system.     1. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF THE SELECTED COMPANY     The financial situation of the business subject is considered to be  a complex output of their  whole performance. This output is presented through the ratio indicators of activity,  profitability, liquidity, indebtedness and market value. These indicators are based on the  synthetic indicators of financial accounting and they  demonstrate the complexity of the business  subject’s performance interpretation  (Baran  and Pastýr , 2014, 6) .    1.1 Financial analysis  - Ex post   A financial situation analysis is the foundation of the company’s economic performance  analysis and usually proceeds down to primary fields and results as effectivity, efficiency,  production capacity utilisation , supplement management and the like. Financial analysis detect s  weaknesses  and strengths of the comp any, is the tool of “health” diagnostics and provides  essential information to business management and to owners (Vlachynský, 2009, 369) .  Sedláček understands the financial analysis of the company as a method of the company’s  financial management evaluatio n, during  which the data obtained is graded, aggregated  and  compared to each other . Furthermore,  the relationships between them are quantified, looking  for the causal connection between the data and their development  is determined . This increases  the explanatory power of data processing and its informative value. Thus it focuses on  identifying problems, strengths, weaknesses and foremost the company’s value processes.  Information obtained through financial analysis enables us to re ach some conclusions about  general management and the financial situation of the company and represents a background  for management decision making (Sedláček, 2009, 3) .   The main purpose of financial analysis is to express assets and the financial position  of the  company and to prepare the inputs for internal management decision making. The c omplexity  and continuous execution are the essential requirements of financial analysis (Hrdý, 2009, 118) . 75   The c ompany’s financial situation is diverse and a multifacet ed complex phenomenon;  consequently this diversity is transferred also into the financial analysis process. The user of  the financial analysis results decides which  indicator’s to select and the priority of utili sation of  individual parts of the financial analysis according to demand and intention (Baran et. al , 2011) .  Among primary users of the financial analysis we might include various subjects mainly  as  owners, managers, employees, lenders (suppliers, banks), debtors (customers), institutions  of state and public administration, external analytics, media and etc (Baran, 2008) .  The review of the company’s financial situation is declared by the system of financial  indicators, which have to be in order and designed to reflect all the important aspects of the  financial situation. Therefore, for a description of the financial situation the ratio indicators are  used. The ratio indicators enable a comparative  analys is of the company with other companies  or with indicators for the relevant area. The s um of ratio indicators we’ll present, can be  considered as the sum of representative indicators. Specifically, these will be the most  commonly used indicat ors of the financial situation  characteristics . However, along with the  practical application , dozens of indicators are used, and it is not possible to mention  all of them  (Baran, 20 15).   In practice , the use of several basic indicators has been proven rel evant which can be  categorised  into groups according to individual areas of management evaluation and the  financial health of the company. Mostly these are groups of indicator s such  as debt, liquidity,  profitability, activity, capital market indicators, as well as other indicators (Knapková, 2013,  84).  Based on the objectives that have been set within this article, we’ll provide more detail on  the ratio indicator s of profitability an d liquidity.     1.1.1 Financial analysis - Indicators of activity   The activity indicators are used for business asset management, because they evaluate how  effectively a business subject manages their assets . A business subject rates the commitment of  indivi dual items of the capital in certain forms of assets . If the business subject may have more  assets  than is appropriate , then unnecessary costs are incur red and the profit is adjusted. In  contrast , if the business subject may have few assets  the possible in comes may be lost  (Baran,  2015) .  When applying indicators of activity we see a problem in the work with flows and stocks.  While the balance sheet represents assets and liabilities at a particular point in time, the profit  and loss statement records the cos ts and revenues continuously over the year. Therefore, when  working with those indicators it is necessary due to the least possible deviation from the actual  that the calculation shows the average of individual balance sheets items (Pastýr , 2014 ).  The t ime of stock turnover testifies how many days does a stock turnover take. In other  words, it indicates the time that is required for the transition of financial resources through  production and products back into the form of money. The ideal situation is w hen the business  subject over time shows a decreasing value of this indicator. A short time (time scale) is usually  the expression of greater efficiency. However, it is necessary to take into account the nature of  the business. Alternatively, in the denomi nator instead of revenues the costs can be used.     stock  turnover =average  stock revenuesx 365   76   The receivables turnover tells how long the business assets hang in the form of receivables  or in how long time the receivables are paid on average. The recommend ed value is obviously  the standard time period of invoices maturity, because most of the consigned products are  invoiced and each invoice has its maturity. If the time period of receivables turnover has been  longer than the standard time period of invoices  maturity that would mean failure to comply  with the trade credit policy from business partners. However, at present it is quite common that  the time of invoices payment exceeds the declared. Definitely, in this case it is important to take  into considerat ion what is the size of the analysed  company. For small businesses the longer  period of receivables maturity may cause significant financial issues with the possibility of  bankruptcy. While large businesses are from the financial point of view more able to  tolerate  longer period of maturity. The time horizon, which could be considered as optimal, should also  meet the criteria of business commercial policy (Růčková, 2005, 122) .    receivables  turnover =average  stock  of short −term  receivables revenuesx 365    The maturity of short -term liabilities reflects the time of incurrence until its payment. This  indicator should reach at least the values of receivables turnover maturity. The indicators of  receivables turnover maturity and the liabilities turnover maturit y are important for assessing  the timing differences from the inception of receivables until their collections and from  incurring of liabilities until the payment. This difference directly influences the business  liquidity. As far as the turnover , the time of commitment is greater than the sum of stock and  receivables turnover, the suppliers credits finance receivables and stock, which  is preferable.  However, it may reflect low liquidity levels. Between the level of liquidity and activity is a  close connect ion and a certain compromise should be looked for (Knapková, 2013, 105) .    liabilities  turnover =average  stock  of short −term  liabilities revenuesx 365    The long -term asset  turnover is relevant in decision -making to determine whether to procure  the next long-term production asset. A lower value of the indicator than the average in the field  is a signal for production to increase capacity utili sation and for financial managers to reduce  business investments (Sedláček, 2001,  61).     long −term  asset  turnover =revenue average  stock  of long −term  assets    In general , with  asset  turnover , it applies that the larger the value of the indicator, the more  positively the situation is asse ssed. A minimal recommended value of this indicator is 1. Yet  the value is influenced  by the industry as well. A low value of indicator means a  disproportionate business subject’s asset facilities and its inefficient use (Knapková, 2013,  104).    asset  turnover =revenues average  stock  of assets    In this case, it is possible to substitute the r evenues with the profits, though the result may be  overestimated due to different types of income that are not related to the main business activity. 77   It is appropriate to use the sale or revenues from the sales of  ones own products and services or  to combi ne both kinds of profits (Knapková, 2013, 104) .    1.1.2 Financial analysis - Indicators of profitability     The indicators of profitability, sometimes referred to as indicators of profit, return,  profitability ratio, are designed as a ratio of the final effect achieved by business activity  (output) to some comparative base (input) that can be on the side of assets  as well as on the side  of liabilities , or to another base. These indicators display the positive or also negative influence  on asset  management, the business subject’s financing and liquidity on profitability  (Kislingerová, 2007, 83) .  All indicators of profitability have a similar interpretation, because they specify how much  EUR of revenues (the numerator) cases per 1 EUR of i ndicator mentioned in the denominator.  Because there exists a multitude of profitability ratio indicators; we’ll address only those that  are the most important. Altogether we’ll approach the explanatory power of selected and  mentioned indicators. In this a rticle we’ll mention the following, in practice most frequently  used indicators of profitability (Baran, 2015) .  A return on sales indicator explains to us, how is the business subject able to use inputs for  their effective operations. The final value of this indicator is directly influenced by the character  of the business activity, price policy, production regulation, etc. A more accurate statement of  this type of indi cator provides us a ratio of partial results of the business subject’s management  to their revenues (Baran, 201 5).    return  on sales =net income income x 100  operating  return  on sales =operating  profit income x 100    share  of added  value  in revenues =added  value income x 100    The profitability indicator (return of income) of total capital compares the result of business  activity with the volume of invested capital (Farkašová, 2007, 42) . This indicator specifies the  assessment of total capital, the business subject  has used for their activity. By assessment of the  capital part of the equity, is a process of profit distribution after tax. It is possible for the  business subject to execute the profit distribution after tax, but not until the general assembly  approves the following:   - to increase capital,   - to subsidi se funds from revenues,   - to retain the profit after tax undistributed or   - to repay dividends (in the case of plc).   By valori sation of capital, the business subject is commissioned to pay back part of the  capital  to the lender. Professional literature states an indicator level reference not to be higher  than the interest rate of long -term loans.     return  on assets  (ROA )=net profit assets x 100   78   A return on equity is essential for the business subject’s owners and for lenders has a  supporting meaning. In general , the value of indicators should be higher than the interest rate  of risk -free bonds (Černá, 1997, 73) .     return  on equity  (ROE )=net profit equity x 100    The level of return on equity is strongly dependent on the return on assets and on the interest  rate of borrowed capital. The increase of the indicator ROE mostly depends on the level of the  business subject’s created profit, on a drop in interest rate of the borrowed capital, on a decline  in the equity’s share on a business subject’s return on assets and a combination of all previous  factors (Baran, 201 5).    1.1.3 Financial analysis - Indicator of liquidity   Liquidity is a combination  of all potential liquid resources that are available for the  company to meet their payment obligations. According to professional literature solvency is  defined as the readiness of the business subject to undertake payment of their obligations at the  time of their reimbursement and therefore is one of the basic conditions of the company’s  successful existence (Sedláček, 2009, 66) .   We can conclude that there exists mutual conditioning of liquidity indicators and solvency.  The condition of solvency is to att ain that the business subject would have part of the assets  bond ed to the available assets, which are disposable to obligations for reimbursement in the  form of short -term financial asset s- mostly bank accounts. Furthermore , we are able to conclude  that th e condition of solvency is liquidity. The indicators of liquidity are put into the ratio : the  individual short -term financial assets against short -term obligations. Indicators of liquidity  engage into the most liquid part of the business subject’s assets  and are divided according to  level of liquidity of individual assets , which are mentioned in the numerator of financial  statements - the balance sheet. The disadvantage of indicators is that these indicators evaluate  liquidity according to balances of short -term asset s (current assets) which on the other hand  mainly depends on future cash -flow (Baran  and Pastyr , 2014, 9) .  Liquidity of the 1st level shows, how many times the short -term financial asset s (current  assets ) covers the  short -term obligations of the business subject. This means, how many times  is the business subject able to satisfy their lenders, if they would convert some of the short -  term asset s (current assets) items instantly into available assets (Baran, 2015, 10) .   For the success of the company it is essential to pay short -term obligations from those  assets  that are designated for this purpose (Valach, 1999, 109) . The 1st level liquidity indicator  has its meaning foremost for the lenders of business subject’s short -term obligations and  provides information of the extent to which the short -term components of capital (borrowed  capital) covers the value of the asset, because lenders undertake some risk, which is, that their  claim won’t be reimbursed. The higher the value of the 1st level liqu idity indicator is, in general,  the more likely is the business subject’s solvency is ensured.   This characteristic is only really a rough sketch, because it s explanatory ability further  depends on the current assets structure, liquidity of individual kind s of current assets and as  well on the type of industry the company operates in (Valach, 1999, 109) .    1st level  liquidity  =current  financial  assets short −term  foreign  sources   79   For coverage of the business subject’s short -term obligations , can be used the immediate  financial resources that are available on bank accounts and in treasury as well as expected  financial resources of not yet refunded short -term obligations. This relationship gives us  liquidity of the 2nd level. As professional li terature states, the recommended values should be  located within interval 1 - 1.5.       2nd  level  liquidity  =current  financial  assets +short −term  obligations short −term  foreign  sources    Liquidity of the 3rd level determines  the ability of the company to pay their obligations to  short -term borrowed capital throug h the current asset s. This means that the company does have  enough short -term resources to manage their regular operation. The optimal i nterval is 1.5 to a  max of 2.5 and in comparison t o the liquidity of 1st or 2nd level is increased for the reasons of  lower liquidity of supplies. The short -term borrowed capital shouldn’t exceed 40 % of the  current asset value  (Kotulič, 2010, 60) .    3rd level  liquidity =current  assets short −term  foreign  sources    Current asset s includes the sum of current financial asset s, short -term receivables and  supplies. Permanent solvency is one of the basic conditions of the business subject’s successful  existence within the market conditions. Thus, the probability of  its maintenance is a reasonable  part of the global characteristic of the business subject’s financial health.      1.1.4 Financial analysis - Horizontal liquidity   A very important task within liquidity analysis is horizontal liquidity. The horizontal  liquidity examines the mutual context and relations among items of assets and items of capital  in financial statements - the balance sheet. The c urrent asset s of the business subject should be  covered by short -term resou rces (Baran  and Pastyr , 2014, 8) .    1.1.4.1 Golden statistic rule   Every kind of asset should be financed by the source of the asset with the reimbursement  period (liquidity) that corresponds to the period of effective use of relevant asset. This fact is  considered as the basic finance management rule and is called the golden statistic rule  (Šlosárová, 2006, 351) .  The golden statistic rule requires that the source coverage of long -term asset s (LA) is long- term sources coverage (LC). This means that the financial resources won’t be available for  shorter than the commitment of equity participation, for which this serves. A relationship  between long -term asset s and long - term sources can be in this case t hreefold (Kotulič, 2010):    LC < LC, or LA – LC < 0 => company is pre -financed,    LA > LC, or LA – LC > 0 => company is under -financed,    LA = LC, or LA – LC = 0 => company asset s are optimally financed.   Balance equilibrium, which has to be preserved in the balance sheet, results in these  relationships having an  effect on the current asset s and its finance. The c urrent asset s (CA)  should be covered mostly by current sources (CS). The difference between CA and CS is called  a NET working capital.  80   1.1.4.2 NET working capital   The net working capital is an indicator, which reconstructs part of the current asset s  (current assets ) that is financed by long -term financial resources, either by equity or by  borrowed capital. The business subject’s net working capital e nables in theory a case that the  business subject in real time is obligated to reimburse a significant proportion of their short - term obligations, which form a meaningful source of their funding to further operate. The  overload of current asset s towards sh ort-term obligations demonstrates to us that the business  subject is from the point of view of current liquidity liquid. This means that the business subject  has a financial background in the form of long -term financial resources. (Baran, 2015)   NWC = curre nt assets  – short -term obligations   where NWC is the net working capital.   1.1.5 Financial analysis - Indicators of indebtedness   The term of indebtedness expresses the fact that the company finances their assets  by  foreign sources. By using foreign sources the company affects both the profitability of  shareholders as well as the business risk. Today, it’s practically pointless for large sized  companies to finance all their assets  from equity or vice versa only fro m foreign capital. By  using only equity would result in an overall return on invested capital reduction within the  company. On the other hand, financing of all business activities only by foreign capital is  excluded, because within the legal regulations a certain mandatory amount of equity to start a  business is bound. Therefore, in business finance  activities its own as well as foreign capital are  implicated. The main motive of financing their activities by foreign capital is the relatively low  price compa red to its own resources. The involvement of foreign sources in business financing  enables reduce costs for the use of capital in the company (Kislingerová, 2007, 96) .  Although the theory of refer red higher cost of equity compared to foreign capital is  questionable , at the present time of low interest rates it seems to be more advantageous to use   ones own equity unless the company or shareholders have it at their disposal.   The indicator of total indebtedness, which is expressed by the ratio of foreign sour ces to  overall assets  further expresses to what extent the assets of the company include foreign  sources. The creditors do not prefer too high a proportion of debt. Rather they favour a lower  proportion of debt. This gives them greater  assurance  that in th e case of the company’s  liquidation their receivables will be more likely satisfied. For the owners , the foreign sources  are less expensive than their own and at a higher debt rate the profitability of capital is increased.  The optimal value of this indica tor for the production company is 40  % up to 60  % (Farkašová,  2007, 39) .    total  indebtedness =foreign  sources assetsx 100    To measure the indebtedness , a ratio of equity to total assets is used.   - coefficient of self -financing, which is a complementary indicator ( self -financing) and their  sum with total indebtedness should give 100  %. This indicator expresses the proportion, in  which the assets  of the company are financed by shareholders’ finances. It is considered as  one of the most important ratios of indebtedness for the overall financial situation  assessment . Yet once again the relation ship with the profitability indicator is important   (Růčková, 200 5, 117) .  coefficient  of self −financing =equity assetsx 100 81   Insolvency notes the relation ship between items - assets and liabilities. If the resulting value  is greater than 1, it is a so -called primary insolvency and if the value is less than 1, we’re talking  about so -called secondary insolvency of the company (Farkašová, 2007 , 40).  insolvency =short −term  liabilities short −term  receiveblesx 100    Credit indebtedness is interpreted as a mutual relation ship between bank loans and  overdrafts in the numerator and fore ign sources located in the denominator. The resulting  relation ship is expressed in a percentage  (Pastýr , 2014 ).   credit  indebtedness =bank  loans  and overdrafts foreign  sourcesx 100  The indicator of interest coverage expresses the number of times the profit is higher than  the paid interest. Hence this indicator is used by the company to determine whether the debt  burden is feasible. It informs shareholders about the company’s ability to pay interests and  creditors about whether and how to ensure their rights in the case of the company’s liquidation.  The inability to pay the interests payments from the profit can predict approaching business  bankruptcy. If the value of this indicator re aches a value of 1, the entire profit would cover the  interest expense. Thus it is recommended that the value of the indicator is higher than 3 (Hrdý,  2009, 130) .    interest  coverage =economic  result  before  tax+interest  expense interest  expense    The indebtedn ess flow tells about the value of commitment in terms of total annual cash  flow of the company. This indirectly implies about the time required to cover the debts from  the annual perspective, where the entire value is considered 100  %. Usually it is requir ed that  the repayment of debt is not longer than 3 years (Farkašová, 2007,  40).    indebtedness  flow =foreign  sources cash  flow    The indebtedness is not always a negative characteristic  of the company. Nevertheless, the  higher the debt, the greater the business risk and the harder it is to obtain foreign sources of  financing foremostly to get a loan from a bank  (Šlosárová, 2006, 345) .    2. RESULTS AND DISCUSSI ON    In this chapter we interp ret the financial -economic analysis of assets , liquidity, profitability  and indebtedness , the golden statistic rule or the net working capital in the specific example of  the following business subject. The research consists of results from the calculations, graphs  and following the course and trend evaluation of the monitored indicators. The data for  financial -economic analysis has been derived from financial statements as the balance sheet,  and profit and loss account. For the cause of relevance we used the statements, reports dated  from 2009 till 2014.      82   2.1 Activity indicators of the monitored business subject     In the next subchapter we’ll look how a business subject manages  its assets and what is its  effectiveness. The exact values of the analysed  indicators and their development can be seen in  Table 1 and Graph 1 (see Tab. 1 and Graph 1 below).   Tab. 1  Indicators of activity    m. u.  2009  2010  2011  2012  2013  2014   Inventory turnover  day 102,41  87,69  113,29  105,36  83,75  90,16   Short -term receivables collection  period  day 88,77  76,01  98,20  91,32  72,60  78,16   The maturity of short -term liabilities  day 101,35  86,79  112,13  104,27  82,89  89,24   Fixed assets turnover  coef.  3,85 4,50 3,48 3,74 4,71 4,37  Total assets turnover  coef.  1,18 1,38 1,07 1,15 1,44 1,34  Source: (Pastýr, 2014,  72)    In graph 1 , the activity indicators of the monitored business subject are graphically shown.     Graph 1  Indicators of activity     Source: (Pastýr, 2014,  73)  The values of assets  turnover through the analysed  period  both increased and decreased .  The highest value the company recorded in 2013 i.e. 1.44. The weakest asset use of the business  subject has been reached in 2011 with the value 1.07. This result has been mostly affected by  an item production in progress and semi -finished products with the value € 3,418,601, which  entered in the following year the highest value € 20,425,932. With the decline of production in  progress als o the profits decreased, which in 2011 have been the lowest during the reporting  period. This implies that the business subject had during  this time issues with contracts, which  has been proved as well by employment decline from 477 to 307. In the last yea r the indicator  declined slightly due to the growth of long -term fixed asset s.  The long -term asset turnover has the same development as total assets  turnover, though the  differences between the values are greater. Fixed asset s had approximately the same va lue, but  is worth noting that in 2013 the value is € 8,719,077 and in 2014, the value is € 26,737,025.  The difference between them was due to constructions and separate movable assets and sets of  movable assets, which grew from the merge r of the analysed  business subject with SAM by the  E.S.C.B, Inc. Bratislava. The indicator reaches its lowest value in 2011 at 3.48. In this year, as  we already stated, the decline of profits from sales of their own products and services occurred.   0,0020,0040,0060,0080,00100,00120,00 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014Inventory turnover Short-term receivables collection period The maturity of short-term liabilities Fixed assets turnover Total assets turnover83   The indicator of the stock turnover time period has fluctuating values  by 6 months . The  peak was reached in 2011 of 113 days. This long stock turnover was been mainly caused by the  decline of material and production in progress and semi -finished products. In this year the  revenues d ecreased by about € 10,960,961. The ideal situation is to achieve the minimum of  this indicator, which occurred  in 2013, when the stock turnover amounted to 83.75 days.   The receivables and stock turnover time period show  similar trends . The lowest value was  reached in 2013, when the short -term receivables collection period was 72.60 days and maturity  of short -term liabilities was 82.89 days. In every reporting year we can see that the short -term  receivables collection had a lower value than the maturity of short -term liabilities. For the  business subject this state is of a positive nature, because it expresses that the customers repay  their debts before the business subject repays its liabilities.   2.2 Profitability indicators of the mon itored business subject     The indicators of profitability are designed as the business subject’s economic result rate  (output) to a comparative item (input). These indicators tell us at what level is the business  subject able to reach profit with the help of the capital  used. In table 2 (see Tab. 2 below) the  profitability indicators values are shown.      Tab. 2  Indicators of profitability    m. u.  2009  2010  2011  2012  2013  2014   Return on sales  % 1,77 2,55 4,54 13,98  11,18  11,68   Operating return  on sales  % 2,52 4,34 6,77 17,65  13,90  13,74   The share of value added in revenues  % 19,90  22,04  24,87  35,90  26,64  30,75   Return on assets (ROA)  % 2,65 3,36 6,46 12,15  16,50  14,03   Return on equity (ROE)  % 6,48 10,18  12,94  30,03  45,59  31,14   Source: (Pastýr, 2014, 71)     In graph 2 , the profitability indicators of the monitored business subject are graphically shown.     Graph 2  Indicators of profitability     Source: (Pastýr, 2014, 71)   0,005,0010,0015,0020,0025,0030,0035,0040,0045,0050,00 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014Return on sales Operating return on sales Share of added value in revenues Return on assets Return on equity84   The profitability indicator of return on sale interprets that the business subject has reached  a profit increase, which was highest in 2012 with the value 13.98 % . This was caused by a larger  amount of orders and subsequently the increase of supplies at the date of the report compilation.  In the following two years this value decreased due to a slight change of sales return state which  stabili sed to the level 11.18 % and 11.68 %.    The return on sale s shows a similar trend to the operating return on sale s. Until  2012 the  operating return on sale s has shown an increase , when the indicator reached almost 17.65 %  mainly due to the lower return on sale s of their own products and services and due to higher  profit from business activity  operations . In the last two years the income from operations  stabili sed yet the revenues incr eased, which caused the indicator to decrease to 13.90 % and to  13.74 %.   Once again, in 2012, the share of added value to revenues , displayed  the highest value  at  35.90 %, which for the business subject over the last  6 years was the most successful. Within  the next  two years , a lower value occurred mainly due to change of revenues size from the sale  of their products and services. The i ndicator shows  overall positive progress.   The p ositive profitability of the total ca pital reflects  the production power, and provides   details about the effective asset utili sation and thus the assets of the business subject. This  indicator has been increasing every year and the highest value reached in 2013 of 16.50 %. In  the following year, only a small decline to 14.03 % occurred mainly due to the merge r with a  minor business subject and due to the increase in fixed assets of land, buildings and non -fixed  assets.     Return on equity invested  by the owners into the business, reache d a positive value as well,  which is a positive signal for the business subject’s owners. It is worth not ing 2013, in which  the return on equity reached  the level of 45.59 %. This was caused by a decrease of retained  earnings, wh ich means, that the profit was r edistributed among owners of the public limited  company via dividends reimbursement.    In the latest  year the return on equity value declined to 31.14 % due to capital funds  subsid ies.    2.3 Liquidity indicators of the monitored business subject   The business subject’s ability to repay their obligations is a necessary factor for a long- term successful venture. Therefore constant monitoring is important by both the business  subject and by external users, who could cooperate with the business subject  or that already  cooperate with them. In table 3 (see Tab. 3 below) the values of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd level liquidity  indicators are shown.     Tab. 3  Indicators of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd level of liquidity    m. u  2009  2010  2011  2012  2013  2014   Liquidity of  1st level  coef.  0,15 0,14 0,31 0,23 0,04 0,07  Liquidity of  2nd level  coef.  0,69 0,97 1,68 0,51 0,87 0,52  Liquidity of  3rd level  coef.  1,68 2,00 2,85 1,40 1,20 0,89  Source: (Pastýr, 2014, 71)     Graph 3 shows the monitored business subject’s indicators for the  1st, 2nd and 3rd level of  liquidity.      85   Graph 3  Indicators of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd level of liquidity     Source: (Pastýr, 2014, 71)     According to the recommended range for engineering business subjects indicated by  professional literature the values of the 1st level of liquidity should vary from 0.2 to 0.6. When  looking at the table, it is visible that the values of the monitored business subject are ge nerally  much lower and they don’t reach the recommended value . This tells us about the business  subject’s inability to instantly refund their short -term obligations. The lowest rate that the  indicator has registered was during  the most recent two years, wh en the values reached 0.04  and 0.07 %. These low values were mainly caused by an increase of obligations from business  relations hips and an increase of obligations  towards the owners. Two exceptions can be taken  as a positive fact and that is 2011 with a value of 0.31 and 2012 with a value of 0.23.  The 2nd  level of liquidity should vary within an  interval of 1-1.5. Within this range only the value 1.68  achieved in 2011 is located. In recent years , the values were lower than the interval limit 1. The  lowest value 0.51 was reached in 2012. This value was largely influenced by accruals, more  accurately, by short - term deferred revenues, which reached up 17  400 198 €. From these values  we can assume that the business s ubject besides in 2011 didn’t have the ability to refund their  short -term obligations with their short -term receivables. Also in the case of a need to repay their  short -term obligations the business subject would have to proceed with a change of less liqui d  asset s to more liquid asset s. For the  3rd level of liquidity the business subject’s supplies were  included. The r ecommended values should vary between  2 and 2.5. Within this range falls 2010  with the value 2 and 2011 with the value up to 2.85. For some p ositive fact we can consider  that the business subject has their 3rd level liquidity over the value of 1, which creates a situation,  in which they are able to repay their short -term obligations with their current asset s. The  indicator’s lowest value is achieved by the business subject in 2014 at 0.89 due to changes of  several items of production in the progress decline, blank stock, business relation ship  receivables, the increase in other current reserves and liabilities  towards partners.     2.4 Horizontal liquidity of the monitored business subject   In the following part of the article we  will outline  the achieved values of different  indicators, the golden statistic rule and the net working capital of the business subject.       0,000,501,001,502,002,503,00 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014Liquidity of  1st level Liquidity of  2nd level Liquidity of  3rd level86   2.4.1 Golden statistic rule   In table 4 (see Tab. 4 below) the values of the golden statistic rule indicator of the monitored  business subject for each year are shown.

Graph 4  Indicator of the golden statistic rule in €     Source: own research    A view of the business subject’s long -term funding displays the golden statistic rule. From  graph 4 it is clearly seen that the business subject was in all analysed  years of time series, with  exception of the latest year, over -financed. This indicates that they have mor e long -term  resources as fixed asset that is owned by the business subject.   Given the fact that the business subject disposes of approximately the same fixed asset  value, the size of difference is conditional mostly on equity development and by accruals. T he  highest negative value was reached by the business subject in 2010 due to a high level item of  deferred long -term earnings. From this year the value of the golden statistic rose slightly. In the  latest year the indicator’s value reached a negative value due to the merge r of the monitored  business subject with a minor business subject, resulting in high growth of fixed asset s mostly  in the form of buildings and non -fixed assets.        2.4.2 Net working capital   In table 5 (see below Tab. 5 below) the indicator values of net working capital  by the  monitored business subject for each year are listed.      -20 000 000-15 000 000-10 000 000-5 000 00005 000 00010 000 00015 000 00020 000 00025 000 000 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014Fixed assets Long- term obligations Golden statistic rule87   Tab. 5  Indicator s of net working capital     2009  2010  2011  2012  2013  2014   CA 19 403 638 28 020 007  17 872 437  37 793 178  25 639 724  18 248 631   SO 11 580 734  14 044 305  6 279 600  27 077 378  21 365 752  20 445 240   CA- SO=NWC  7 822 904  13 975 702  11 592 837  10 715 800  4 273 972  -2 196 609   Source: own research   In graph 5 the indicator development of net working capital by the monitored business subject  is graphically displayed.     Graph 5  Indicator s of net working capital     Source: own research   From the viewpoint of a comparison with net working capital we can state that NWC has  a natural reverse correlation  with the golden statistic rule. In the business subject until 2012 ,  current asset s exceeded short -term obligations. This fact from the business subject’s point of  view is judged as positive, because in the case of necessity , the business subject is able to  reimburse their obligations by current asset s, which testifies of their good financial situation.  According to graph 5 we can conclude that this value from 2010 decreases due to the decline  of incomplete production and blank stock. In 2012, 2013 and 2014 the decline is also caused  by the increase of business relation ship obligations. In the last reporting  year,  2014 , the net  working capital reached  negative values. Based on this , arises slight ly unfunded debt, wh ich is  for the business subject a warning signal, because in the need for repay ment  of short -term  obligations, they would be forced to sell part of their fixed asset s and thereby would be forced  to influence the business subject’s operations.     2.5 Indebtedness indicators of monitored business subject   By means of these indicators, we look at the financial structure and indebtedness of the  business subject and its indeb tedness repayment ability. The results are shown in table 6 below.

Graph 6 Indicators of indebtedness     Source: (Pastýr, 2014 , 74)  Total assets indebtedness during our 6 year reporting period showed  a fluctuating character.  Their values are in the range from 50.08 up to 67.01. For the optimal total indebtedness is  considered the value 50  %. The company was the closest to this point in 2011 with the value  50.08. They were the most in debt in 2012 with the value 67.01 mainly due to the increase of  time differentiation or profits from future long -term periods.   The coefficient of self -financing is directly related to total assets  indebtedness, which  assesses the field from the point of view of the company’s owners and its sum is  made of                     100 %. Thus its development is the opposite and equally volatile to total asset  indebtedness.  The business subject was the most financially independent in 2011 with 49.92 .   Immediately in the first reporting year the indicator o f insolvency ha d the highest value of 2.04,  from which we can judge that the business subject had issues surrounding  its own activity,  whereas its liabilities to receivables were  higher by more than twice and it s the initial insolvency  mainly due to short -term trade receivables. The business subject entered secondary insolvency  in 2011, when the indicator’s value was 0.91 due to a slight increase of short -term receivables  and decrease of short -term liabilities from trade.   In 2012 the credit indebtedness was a  decreasing trend. The highest financing of foreign  sources through bank loans was reported  in the first reporting year of 2009 with 19.14  %. In  2012 they reached the lowest value of only 0.80  % due to an increase of time differentiation  item profits from future long -term periods.   The interest coverage after 2013 showed an increasing trend . Its value increases  exponentially, which can also be seen on the graph. In 2009 this indicator reached the value  only of 3.94, wh ich was caused by low pre-tax trading income and higher interest expense. In  2013 this indicator increased to 105.71 and in 2013 to a value of 244.30, which was mainly due  to high trade income before tax and low interest expense. This implies that the company covers  their interests with its  profit without any issues.   The indebtedness flow has a fluctuating trend . In 2009 and 2010 this indicator increases to  the value of 11.50. Afterwards  the indicator’s decline until 2013, when the business subject  0,0050,00100,00150,00200,00250,00 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014Total debt assets Coefficient of self- financing Credit indebtedness Interest coverage Flow debt89   would pay its liabilities (debts) at the fo rmation of cash flow of 3.31 per year. Already in the  last reporting year only a slight decrease occurred .    3. PROPOSAL FOR IMPROVE MENTS OF MONITORED B USINESS SUBJECT´S  SELECTED RATIO INDICATORS OF  FINANCIAL -ECONOMIC ANALYSIS     After the processing of financial -economic analysis several weaknesses of the business  subject have been revealed. In the synthesis of this information and following induction we can  generali se some measures for long - term successful operation of the business subjec t. It is the  incorporation of the following measures.     3.1 The activity ratio indicator of the monitored business subject   At the time of stock turnover we propose continuous stock monitoring to prevent the  adverse ly high inventory. As well in the future we propose some optimi sation of stock flow  management in relation to production or its improved procurement from various suppliers,  storage and use through a precise time system, motion planning in parallel with produ ction  needs.   The time of short -term receivables collection can enable further possible business  development within fair trade and good customer -supplier relationships . I see the possibility of  improvement or the volume and frequency of short - term receivab les reduction as well as the  time period of their reimbursement in the incentives of customers themselves through the  provision of cash discount, price discounts for payment before the due date of the relevant  receivable and thereby ensuring stabili sation or receivables turnover time reduction.   A further possibility to decrease the short -term receivables collection is to introduce a strict  internal control system in issuing e.g. customer invoices in the form of rescheduling.   To ensure the timely payment of  receivables of less responsible customers it is necessary  to apply the reminders notice mechanism or sanctioning for non -compliance of contractual  conditions of payment.   In the case of receivables management improvement the acquired financial sources cou ld  be used to reduce the size as well as the short -term liabilities time period of the business subject  from trade by invoice reimbursement from their suppliers to maturity or sooner, or reducing the  need to use short - term bank loans.   The long - term asset  turnover has significant different values, thus I recommend that the  business subject uses their long -term asset s more effectively.   By decreasing the stock turnover time period ensures the greater production flexibility,  because the high volume of stocks  binds unnecessary finances that could be invested into other  business areas e.g. into its development, moderni sation and etc.   By reducing the short - term receivables time period through using a cash discount or price  discounts for payment before maturity of the receivable will lead to a  decline of unliquidated  short -term receivables in the business subject. This allows further use of cashed financial  sources e.g. the earlier payment of short -term liabilities of the business subject or reducing the  need to use short -term bank loans. In the supplier this motivational tool can induce the  willingness on his part to closer cooperat e under favourable  conditions. The introduction of an  internal control system in issuing of customer invoices timeliness and excellen ce may ensured  this. 90   The decline of the short -term liabilities time period or proper and timely payment of  liability to a supplier can creat e between him and the business subject a favourable  and  competitive supplier -customer relationship that can be in the future reflected e.g. in material  supply for more favourable  quantitative and price conditions.     3.2 The profitability ratio indicator of the monitored business subject   We can state that th e results of profitability indicators have positive values. That means the  business subject achieves continuous profit. Almost all these indicators in a period of six years  achieved within the recent two years a slight downward trend. The interests of the business  subject is to stabili se or to increase these values. Therefore a continuous monitoring of  indicators of sales and profit  is required , to increase the level of these indicators. These  objectives can be achieved by the following measures:    by a flexible pricing policy,    by improving the efficiency of the marketing mix,    by efforts to win new customers and cheaper suppliers,    by investing in financial market products for example in bonds and funds.   On the other hand, to prevent further decline of the business subject’s profit, it is required  to secure the economy and efficiency by optimi sation of costs and by individual asset items  utilisation. It is mainly the following cost items:    the cost of material and energy consumption,   - by applying new prod uction technologies and the use of new or innovated  technology,    - by improving work organi sation and production management in the form of  production process harmoni sation, production capacity utili sation,   - by raising the educational level of employees,    the reduction of personnel costs,   - by standardi sed work of production employees,   - by optimi sation of overhead employees,   - by optimi sation of technical and administrative employees.     Following the introduction of design measures there is a premise of the business subject s  economic result increase for the accounting period as well as the increase of the revenue  indicator s. The business subject will accomplish a stabili sed position on the market by obtaining  new and more advantageous financial relationships.  As well higher profitability and more  efficient capital utili sation for business subject’s owners will be accomplished by reali sation of  the mentioned measures.   By optimi sation of costs the business subject will secure their decrease and at the same  time will create conditions for the implementation of innovative and new technologies and  techni ques that should be introduced  to employees on the appropriate educational level.     3.3 The ratio and differential liquidity indicator of the monitored business subje ct  In 2012 , the value of the golden statistic rule indicator for the monitored business subject  registered growth due to the merge r of two business subjects and the growth of current asset s.  The value of this indicator thus reached a  positive value that means the business subject is  under -financed. As a result of this adverse situation, three  ways of this value reduction are  proposed:  91    by increase  of their fixed resources of settlement by raising their equity through basic  capital incr ease in the form of share issue,    by bond issue,    by increase of their external sources through obtaining of long -term bank loan.   Within the monitored business subject the current asset s exceeds short -term obligations.  The exception of this is the latest yea r, therefore we propose towards the future period to  increase the business subject ’s liquidity by increasing the volume of their current financial  asset s:   by reducing the time of debt collection from business relations (by discount, by  monitoring, by mecha nism of reminders, by penalties),    by reduction of supplement turnover time (better supplement management),    by advance charge on customi sed production,    by sale of surplus asset s, but this asset change could result in a lower ability for further  business activities development in the future.     After the implementation of submitted proposals for increas ing the business subject’s  liquidity, there is the premise of a business subject’s solvency increase while the conditions for  balanced development are created. The business subject will have the necessary financial  resources and will be able to reimburse on time their short -term obligations with their financial  resources as well as be able to use them for further development.     3.4 The indebtedness ratio indicator of the monitored business subject   Undertaking in relation to business activity , the business subject has acceptable values of  total indebtedness as well as the self -financing coefficient, thus I do recommend to monitor,  maintain and not to exceed  this state or this indebtedness rate.   Regarding the insolvency indicator the business subject is primarily located in insolvency,  therefore I recommend that the business subject shall try to reduce the level of a short -term  liabilities.   After the incorpo ration of measures the level of equity and foreign capital will stabili se and  the overall stability will be ensured. The business subject will seem more attractive in the  provision of loans as well as in individual investments.     CONCLUSION     In the present turbulent competitive environment the financial analysis is an essential part  of monitoring the business subject and is an important tool to support the decision making of  various stakeholder groups. Also it provides a picture or feedback about the whole c ondition of  business subject and their development and about a condition of individual operation areas.  This analysis is able to identify factors that with the largest stake have caused undesirable  results within the business subject. Through prediction mo dels of financial -economic analysis  the business subject is able to predict their future development and possible option for  bankruptcy.   Among the benefits of this article belongs financial -economic analysis focused on the  business subject’s ratio indicato rs of activity, profitability, liquidity and indebtedness itself.   Related proposals mentioned in this article for weaknesses elimination which  were found by  financial analysis are focused on practical use in the business subject’s experience.     92   Note   The contribution was written within the framework of a research project VEGA 1/0218/16 on  ""The Model of the implementation of controlling as a management tool within medium  enterprises in the engineering and electronics industries"".

22,"Provided by   Accounting Financial Statements   The Academic Center for Excellence  1 May 2022   Accounting Financial Statements     In accounting , it is important to be able to compose and interpret financial statements. Being  able to do this will allow investors, accountants, and lenders to determine the financial health of a company. This handout will explain how to prepare each financial statement, including the  income statement, statement of retained earnings, balance sheet, and statement of cash flows.     Important Terms   You can click each term to navigate to specific sections of this handout.   Income statement : This is the first financial statement prepared . The income statement is  prepared to look at a company’s revenues and expenses over a certain period, such as a month,  a quarter, or a year. When expenses are subtracted from revenues, the result is net income .     Statement of retained earnings : This is the second financial statement prepared. This statement  shows how much of a company’s earnings were kept within the company and not paid out via  dividends (the earnings distributed to a company’s shareholders).    Balance sheet : This is the third financial statement prepared. The balance sheet shows a  company’s financial position at any point in time, rather than over a period. To prepare a company’s balance sheet, all that is needed is the company’s assets, liabilities, and equity.    Statement of cash flows : This is the last financial statement prepared. The statement of cash  flows lists the cash inflows and outflows for a company over a period, such as a month, a quarter, or a year.    Income Statement   When doing income statements, it is important to account for all types of revenues and expenses. For example, common types of revenue accounts include sales, com missions, fees  earned, interest revenue, and service revenue. Common types of expense accounts include depreciation expense, salary expense, rent expense, utilities expense, income tax expense, and  interest expense. The reason the income statement is prepared first is because the final  product is net income, which is needed for the statement of retained earnings.        Provided by   Accounting Financial Statements   The Academic Center for Excellence  2 May  2022   Example:   ABC Company  had a total revenue of $55,000 during the fiscal year, ending on December 31st.  Of the company’s total revenue, $50,000 was from service revenue, $4,000 was from sales, and  $1,000 was from fees earned. Also, ABC Company  had $28,000 in total expenses. Of the  expenses, $10,000 came from paying employee salaries, $8,000 came from rent expenses, and  $5,000 came from interest expenses. Furthermore, ABC Company  had $3,000 of income tax  expenses, $1,000 in depreciation expenses, $1,000 of utility expenses. A clas s assignment may  require students to complete an income statement that would look like the following table .    Income Statement  ABC Company    For Fiscal Year Ended  December 31   Revenues       Service revenue  $50,000     Sales      4,000     Fees earned      1,000     Total revenues   $55,000        Expenses       Salary expense  $10,000     Rent expense      8,000     Interest expense      5,000     Income tax expense      3,000     Depreciation expense      1,000     Utilities expense      1,000     Total expenses   $28,000        Net income    $27,000     It should be noted that the net income of $27,000 was calculated by subtracting the total  expenses of $28,000 from the total revenues of $55,000. ABC Company ’s net income will be  used to prepare the next financial statement, which is the statement of retai ned earnings.          Provided by   Accounting Financial Statements   The Academic Center for Excellence  3 May  2022   Statement of Retained Earnings   The reason this is the second statement to prepare is because the retained earnings are needed  to prepare the equity section of the balance sheet. T he first item needed to determine a  company’s  retained earnings for a period is to record the retained earni ngs from the beginning  of the period. Next, add the company’s net income from the income statement to the amount of retained earnings at the beginning of the period. Finally, subtract how much money was paid in dividends to the company’s shareholders.   Example:   The following table shows ABC Company ’s retained earnings as of the end of the fiscal year on  December 31st. It should be noted that ABC Company  started the year with $12,000 in retained  earnings. They also had a net income of $27,000 for year, which  was calculated by preparing  the income statement. Lastly, they paid out $4,000 in dividends to company shareholders  during the fiscal year. A class assignment may require students to complete a statement of retained earnings for ABC Company that would loo k like the following table.     Statement of  Retained Earnings  ABC Company   For Fiscal Year Ended  December 31st    Retained earnings  (January 1st)  $12,000   Add Net income    27,000     $39,000   Subtract  Dividends    4,000    Retained earnings   (December 31st)  $35,000     In this example, ABC Company  started the fiscal year with $12,000. After adding $27,000 to that  amount, the running total is $39,000. Next, $4,000 is subtracted from that to account for  dividend payments. Therefore, ABC Company  ends the year with $35,000 in retained earnings.  The $35,000 in retained earnings will be needed to prepare the equity section of the next  financial statement, the balance sheet.            Provided by   Accounting Financial Statements   The Academic Center for Excellence  4 May  2022   Balance Sheet   The balance sheet is prepared using the accounting equation formula. Therefore, it should be  set up as assets = liabilities + equity. The company’s asset accounts should be recorded on the  left side of the page, while its liabilities and equity accounts should be recorded on the right  side of the page. Assets are any tangible item of value that a company owns. Common examples of assets are cash, accounts receivable, land, equipment, and inventory. Liabilities are debts the company owes to other entities, such as lenders, sellers, and other companies.  Common examples of liabilities are accounts payable, wages payable, notes payable, and taxes  payable. The difference between a company’s assets and liabilities is the company’s equity. Within the equity section of the balance sheet, the company’s retained earnings and common stock are listed. The reason the balance sheet is the third statement prepared is because the  cash account balance in assets is needed for the statement of cash flows. The following table  shows ABC Company’s balance sheet on December 31st.   Example:   On December 31 st, ABC Company  had $75,000 in total assets. Of their assets, they had $50,000  in cash, $20,000 in inventory, and $5,000 in accounts receivable. ABC Company  also had  $27,000 in total l iabilities. Of their liabilities, they had $15,000 in wages payable, $6,000 in  accounts payable, $3,000 in taxes payable, and $3,000 in notes payable. In addition, ABC  Company  had $48,000 in equity. Of their equity, they had $13,000 in common stock and  $35,000 in retained earnings. A class assignment may require students to complete a balance sheet for ABC Company that would look like the following table.     Balance Sheet  ABC Company    December 31st   Assets   Liabilities    Cash  $50,000  Wages payable  $15,000   Inventory    20,000  Accounts payable      6,000   Accounts receivable      5,000  Taxes payable      3,000     Notes payable      3,000     Total liabilities   $27,000          Equity      Common stock  $13,000     Retained earnings    35,000     Total equity  $48,000        Total assets  $75,000  Total liabilities and equity  $75,000    Provided by   Accounting Financial Statements   The Academic Center for Excellence  5 May  2022   In the example above, it should be noted that the value of the total assets equals the value of  the total liabilities and equity combined, which is $75,000 for each. Also, remember that the  retained earnings from the previous statement were used to prepare the equity section of the  balance sheet. To prepare the next statement, which is the statement of cash flows, the cash  account balance in the assets section will be needed. Therefore, the $50,000 in cash will be used to prepare the statement of cash flows.    Statement of Cash Flows   The statement of cash flows is divided into three sections. The first section is the cash flows  from operating activities. Examples of operating activity accounts include wages, salaries,  interest payments, interest income, cash receipts from customers, and c ash paid to vendors.  The second section is the cash flows from investing activities. For example, investing cash flows could be the buying and selling of an asset, such as equipment. The third section is the cash flows from financing activities. Examples o f financing cash flows would be dividends paid to  shareholders, cash investments by investors, bond issuances, and repayment of loans. The sum  of net cash flows from all three activities should equal the cash balance in the cash account  from the balance sheet. Additionally, there are two different methods to prepare the statement of cash flows: the direct method and the indirect method.     The following example shows ABC Company ’s statement of cash flows for the fiscal year that  ended on December 31st. ABC Company  uses the direct method in the following example. It  should be noted that account balances in parentheses indicate a negative balance for that  account.     Example:   At the  beginning of the fiscal year, ABC Company  had $0 in cash. During the year, they  increased that amount by $50,000, to end with $50,000. ABC Company  accumulated a net total  of $52,000 from operating activities.  Even though they received $70,000 cash from c ustomer  receipts, they paid $10,000 to vendors and $8,000 for rent. ABC Company  had a negative  balance of $18,000 for investing activities during the year.

23,"Provided by   Accounting Financial Statements   The Academic Center for Excellence  1 May 2022   Accounting Financial Statements     In accounting , it is important to be able to compose and interpret financial statements. Being  able to do this will allow investors, accountants, and lenders to determine the financial health of a company. This handout will explain how to prepare each financial statement, including the  income statement, statement of retained earnings, balance sheet, and statement of cash flows.     Important Terms   You can click each term to navigate to specific sections of this handout.   Income statement : This is the first financial statement prepared . The income statement is  prepared to look at a company’s revenues and expenses over a certain period, such as a month,  a quarter, or a year. When expenses are subtracted from revenues, the result is net income .     Statement of retained earnings : This is the second financial statement prepared. This statement  shows how much of a company’s earnings were kept within the company and not paid out via  dividends (the earnings distributed to a company’s shareholders).    Balance sheet : This is the third financial statement prepared. The balance sheet shows a  company’s financial position at any point in time, rather than over a period. To prepare a company’s balance sheet, all that is needed is the company’s assets, liabilities, and equity.    Statement of cash flows : This is the last financial statement prepared. The statement of cash  flows lists the cash inflows and outflows for a company over a period, such as a month, a quarter, or a year.    Income Statement   When doing income statements, it is important to account for all types of revenues and expenses. For example, common types of revenue accounts include sales, com missions, fees  earned, interest revenue, and service revenue. Common types of expense accounts include depreciation expense, salary expense, rent expense, utilities expense, income tax expense, and  interest expense. The reason the income statement is prepared first is because the final  product is net income, which is needed for the statement of retained earnings.        Provided by   Accounting Financial Statements   The Academic Center for Excellence  2 May  2022   Example:   ABC Company  had a total revenue of $55,000 during the fiscal year, ending on December 31st.  Of the company’s total revenue, $50,000 was from service revenue, $4,000 was from sales, and  $1,000 was from fees earned. Also, ABC Company  had $28,000 in total expenses. Of the  expenses, $10,000 came from paying employee salaries, $8,000 came from rent expenses, and  $5,000 came from interest expenses. Furthermore, ABC Company  had $3,000 of income tax  expenses, $1,000 in depreciation expenses, $1,000 of utility expenses. A clas s assignment may  require students to complete an income statement that would look like the following table .    Income Statement  ABC Company    For Fiscal Year Ended  December 31   Revenues       Service revenue  $50,000     Sales      4,000     Fees earned      1,000     Total revenues   $55,000        Expenses       Salary expense  $10,000     Rent expense      8,000     Interest expense      5,000     Income tax expense      3,000     Depreciation expense      1,000     Utilities expense      1,000     Total expenses   $28,000        Net income    $27,000     It should be noted that the net income of $27,000 was calculated by subtracting the total  expenses of $28,000 from the total revenues of $55,000. ABC Company ’s net income will be  used to prepare the next financial statement, which is the statement of retai ned earnings.          Provided by   Accounting Financial Statements   The Academic Center for Excellence  3 May  2022   Statement of Retained Earnings   The reason this is the second statement to prepare is because the retained earnings are needed  to prepare the equity section of the balance sheet. T he first item needed to determine a  company’s  retained earnings for a period is to record the retained earni ngs from the beginning  of the period. Next, add the company’s net income from the income statement to the amount of retained earnings at the beginning of the period. Finally, subtract how much money was paid in dividends to the company’s shareholders.   Example:   The following table shows ABC Company ’s retained earnings as of the end of the fiscal year on  December 31st. It should be noted that ABC Company  started the year with $12,000 in retained  earnings. They also had a net income of $27,000 for year, which  was calculated by preparing  the income statement. Lastly, they paid out $4,000 in dividends to company shareholders  during the fiscal year. A class assignment may require students to complete a statement of retained earnings for ABC Company that would loo k like the following table.     Statement of  Retained Earnings  ABC Company   For Fiscal Year Ended  December 31st    Retained earnings  (January 1st)  $12,000   Add Net income    27,000     $39,000   Subtract  Dividends    4,000    Retained earnings   (December 31st)  $35,000     In this example, ABC Company  started the fiscal year with $12,000. After adding $27,000 to that  amount, the running total is $39,000. Next, $4,000 is subtracted from that to account for  dividend payments. Therefore, ABC Company  ends the year with $35,000 in retained earnings.  The $35,000 in retained earnings will be needed to prepare the equity section of the next  financial statement, the balance sheet.            Provided by   Accounting Financial Statements   The Academic Center for Excellence  4 May  2022   Balance Sheet   The balance sheet is prepared using the accounting equation formula. Therefore, it should be  set up as assets = liabilities + equity. The company’s asset accounts should be recorded on the  left side of the page, while its liabilities and equity accounts should be recorded on the right  side of the page. Assets are any tangible item of value that a company owns. Common examples of assets are cash, accounts receivable, land, equipment, and inventory. Liabilities are debts the company owes to other entities, such as lenders, sellers, and other companies.  Common examples of liabilities are accounts payable, wages payable, notes payable, and taxes  payable. The difference between a company’s assets and liabilities is the company’s equity. Within the equity section of the balance sheet, the company’s retained earnings and common stock are listed. The reason the balance sheet is the third statement prepared is because the  cash account balance in assets is needed for the statement of cash flows. The following table  shows ABC Company’s balance sheet on December 31st.   Example:   On December 31 st, ABC Company  had $75,000 in total assets. Of their assets, they had $50,000  in cash, $20,000 in inventory, and $5,000 in accounts receivable. ABC Company  also had  $27,000 in total l iabilities. Of their liabilities, they had $15,000 in wages payable, $6,000 in  accounts payable, $3,000 in taxes payable, and $3,000 in notes payable. In addition, ABC  Company  had $48,000 in equity. Of their equity, they had $13,000 in common stock and  $35,000 in retained earnings. A class assignment may require students to complete a balance sheet for ABC Company that would look like the following table.     Balance Sheet  ABC Company    December 31st   Assets   Liabilities    Cash  $50,000  Wages payable  $15,000   Inventory    20,000  Accounts payable      6,000   Accounts receivable      5,000  Taxes payable      3,000     Notes payable      3,000     Total liabilities   $27,000          Equity      Common stock  $13,000     Retained earnings    35,000     Total equity  $48,000        Total assets  $75,000  Total liabilities and equity  $75,000    Provided by   Accounting Financial Statements   The Academic Center for Excellence  5 May  2022   In the example above, it should be noted that the value of the total assets equals the value of  the total liabilities and equity combined, which is $75,000 for each. Also, remember that the  retained earnings from the previous statement were used to prepare the equity section of the  balance sheet. To prepare the next statement, which is the statement of cash flows, the cash  account balance in the assets section will be needed. Therefore, the $50,000 in cash will be used to prepare the statement of cash flows.    Statement of Cash Flows   The statement of cash flows is divided into three sections. The first section is the cash flows  from operating activities. Examples of operating activity accounts include wages, salaries,  interest payments, interest income, cash receipts from customers, and c ash paid to vendors.  The second section is the cash flows from investing activities. For example, investing cash flows could be the buying and selling of an asset, such as equipment. The third section is the cash flows from financing activities. Examples o f financing cash flows would be dividends paid to  shareholders, cash investments by investors, bond issuances, and repayment of loans. The sum  of net cash flows from all three activities should equal the cash balance in the cash account  from the balance sheet. Additionally, there are two different methods to prepare the statement of cash flows: the direct method and the indirect method.     The following example shows ABC Company ’s statement of cash flows for the fiscal year that  ended on December 31st. ABC Company  uses the direct method in the following example. It  should be noted that account balances in parentheses indicate a negative balance for that  account.     Example:   At the  beginning of the fiscal year, ABC Company  had $0 in cash. During the year, they  increased that amount by $50,000, to end with $50,000. ABC Company  accumulated a net total  of $52,000 from operating activities.  Even though they received $70,000 cash from c ustomer  receipts, they paid $10,000 to vendors and $8,000 for rent. ABC Company  had a negative  balance of $18,000 for investing activities during the year. Of that $18,000, $12,000 went  toward purchasing vehicles, $4,000 went toward purchasing computer equipment, and $2,000 went toward purchasing furniture. For financing activities, ABC Company  accumulated a net  total of $16,000. Even though they received $26,000 in investments from investors, they still paid $6,000 towards their bank loan, and $4,000 via d ividends toward their shareholders. A  class assignment may require students to complete a statement of cash flows for ABC Company that would look like the table  on the following page .

The $50,000 was calculated by adding the net cash from operating, investing, and financing activities. It should also be noted that ABC Company  started the fiscal year with  $0 in cash and increased that amount to $50,000 cash by the end of the year.

26,"FINANCIAL ANALYSIS   Financia l Statements     The income statement provides information about  revenue and expenses of a firm,    The balance sheet provides a point in time snap shot of the firm’s assets, liabilities and  owner’s equity.     Benchmarking:  The financial statements by themselves are complex documents involving a  whole bunch of numbers.     One common method of benchmarking is to compare a firm’s current performance against  that of its own performance over a 3 -5 year period (trend analysis) , by l ooking at the growth  rate in various key items such as sales, costs, and profi ts.   Another useful way is to re state the income statement and the balance sheet into common  size statements, by expressing each income statement item as a percent of sales and ea ch  balance sheet item as a percent of total assets     Financial Ratios     Financial ratios allow for meaningful comparisons across time, between competitors, and  with industry averages.    Liquidity ratios : Can the company meet its obligations over the short term?    Solvency ratios : (also known as financial leverage ratios ): Can the company meet its  obligations over the long term?    Asset management ratios : How efficiently is the company managing its assets to g enerate  sales?    Profitability ratios : How well has the company performed overall?    Market value ratios : How does the market (investors) view the company’s financial  prospects?       Du Pont analysis : which involves a breakdown of the return on equity into its th ree  components, i.e. profit margin, turnover, and leverage.     Liquidity Ratios:  measure  a company’s ability to cover its short -term debt obligations in a  timely manner:    Three key liquidity ratios include the current ratio, quick ratio, and cash ratio.     Financial Leverage Ratios:  measure a company’s ability to meet its long -term debt obligations  based on its overall debt level and earnings capacity.    Failure to meet its interest obligation could put a firm into bankruptcy.    Key financial leverage ratios are  the debt ratio, times interest earned ratio, and cash coverage  ratio.     Asset Management Ratios:  measure how efficiently a firm is using its assets to generate  revenues or how much cash is being tied up in other assets such as receivables and inventory.    Key asset management ratios are inventory turnover, accounts receivables turnover, average  collection period, and total asset turnover.    Profitability Ratios:  such as net profit margin, returns on assets, and return on equity, measure a  firm’s effectivenes s in turning sales or assets into profits    Potential investors and analysts often use these ratios as part of their valuation analysis.     Market Value Ratios:  are used to gauge how attractive a firm’s current price is relative to its  earnings, growth rate, a nd book value    Typically, if a firm has a high price to earnings and a high market to book value ratio, it is an  indication that investors have a good perception about the firm’s performance.    If these ratios are very high it could also mean that a firm is over-valued.     DuPont analysis:  involves breaking down ROE into three components of the firm:    operating efficiency , as measured by the profit margin (net income/sales);    asset management efficiency , as measured by asset turnover (sales/total assets); and    financial leverage , as measured by the equity multiplier (total assets/total equity).         Questions   1. What is the accounting identity?   Assets ≡ Liabilities + Owner’s Equity     2. What does analyzing companies over time tell a finance manager?   Trend analysis tells a financial manager the rate at which the various key items are growing  and helps explain why profits are growing or eroding over time.     3. What does restating financial statements into common -size financial statements allow a  finance manager or financial analy st to do?   Common -size financial statements allow a comparison of companies that are very different in  size. It then allows comparison of management choices, such as debt financing or analysis of  production costs.     4. What are liquidity ratios? Given an exampl e of a liquidity ratio and how it helps  evaluate a company’s performance or future performance from an outsider’s view.   Liquidity ratios are ratios that show the short -term cash obligation capabilities of the  company. The current ratio is a liquidity ratio  and it is current assets divided by current  liabilities. When this ratio is greater than one it indicates a company should have sufficient  cash from its current assets to pay off its current liabilities. This helps an outsider evaluate  potential cash flow  problems of the company.     5. What are solvency ratios? Which ratio would be of most interest to a banker  considering a debt loan to a company? Why?   Solvency ratios are ratios that demonstrate the ability of the company to meet debt  obligations over an extend ed period of time. A banker would probably be most interested in  Times Interest Earned to see if the company has sufficient cash from operations to handle  more interest payments on a new loan.  6. What are asset management ratios?   Asset management ratios are r atios that indicate how well the management team is using the  assets of the company to generate prof its.     7. What does the P/E ratio tell an outsider about a com pany?   The P/E ratio tells you if the firm is a growth firm or a stable firm with growth firms ha ving  higher P/E ratios. T     8. What are the three components of the DuPont identity? What do they analyze?   The three components of the DuPont analysis are, (1) operating efficiency, (2) asset  management efficiency, and (3) financial leverage. They analyze the return on equity or the  shareholders’ return.     9. What does analyzing a company against firms in other industries tell a financial  manager or analyst?   Analyzing a company against firms in other industries may indicate what areas the company  and its industry are falling behind in general.         ______________________________________________________________________________     KEY FINANCIAL RATIO S - DETAILS   ______________________________________________________________________________   Current Ratio    Current ratio measures the ability of a business to repay current liabilities with current assets.    Current assets are assets that are expected to be converted to cas h within normal operating  cycle, or one year. Examples of current assets include cash and cash equivalents, marketable  securities, short -term investments, accounts receivable, short -term portion of notes  receivable, inventories and short -term prepayments.    Current liabilities are obligations that require settlement within normal operating cycle or  next 12 months. Examples of current liabilities include accounts payable, salaries and wages  payable, current tax payable, sales tax payable, accrued expenses, etc .  Formula   Current Ratio = Current Assets/Current Liabilities     Analysis    Current ratio matches current assets with current liabilities and tells us whether the current  assets are enough to settle current liabilities.    A current ratio of 1 or more means that  current assets are more than current liabilities and the  company should not face any liquidity problem.    A current ratio below 1 means that current liabilities are more than current assets, which may  indicate liquidity problems.    In general, higher current ratio is better.    Current ratios should be analyzed in the context of relevant industry. Some industries for  example retail, have very high current ratios. Others, for example service providers such as  accounting firms, have relatively low current r atios because they do not have any significant  current assets.    An abnormally high value of current ratio may indicate existence of idle or underutilized  resources in the company.     Quick Ratio    Quick ratio is a stricter measure of liquidity of a company than its current ratio.     Quick ratio is most useful where the proportion of illiquid current assets to total current  assets is high.     Formula   Quick Ratio = (Cash + Marketable Securities + Receivables )/Current Liabilities     Another approach to calculation of quick ratio involves subtracting all illiquid current assets  from total current assets and dividing the resulting figure by total current liabilities.      Quick Ratio = (Current Assets − Inventories – Prepayments )/Current Liabilities    Analysis    Quick rati o is particularly useful in assessing liquidity situation of companies in a crunch  situation, i.e. when they find it difficult to sell inventories.    Quick ratio should be analyzed in the context of other liquidity ratios such as current ratio,  cash ratio, e tc., the relevant industry of the company, its competitors and the ratio’s trend  over time.    A quick ratio lower than the industry average might indicate that the company may face  difficulty honoring its current obligations. Alternatively, a quick ratio si gnificantly higher  than the industry average highlights inefficiency as it indicates that the company has parked  too much cash in low -return assets.     Debt Ratio    Debt ratio (also known as debt to assets ratio) measures debt level of a business as a  percentage of its total assets.    It is calculated by dividing total debt of a business by its total assets.    Debt ratio finds out the percentage of total assets that are financed by debt .   A too high percentage  indicate that it is too difficult for the business to pay off its debts and  continue operations.     Formula   Debt Ratio = Total Debt /Total Assets    Total debt equals long -term debt and short -term debt.    Total assets include both current assets and non -current assets.     Analysis    Debt ratio is a measure of a business’s financial risk, the risk that the business’ total assets  may not be sufficient to pay off its debts and interest thereon.    While a very low debt ratio is good, it may indicate underutilization of a major source of  finance which may result in restricted growth.     Times Interest Earned Ratio    Times interest earned ratio (also called interest coverage ratio) is an indicator of the  company’s ability to pay off i ts interest expense with available earnings.    It is a measure of a company’s solvency, i.e. its long -term financial strength.    It calculates how many times a company’s operating income (earnings before interest and  taxes) can settle the company’s interest e xpense.    A higher times interest earned ratio indicates that the company’s interest expense is low  relative to its earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) which indicates better long -term  financial strength, and vice versa.     Formula   Times Interest Earned  = Earnings before Interest and Tax  (EBIT)/ Interest Expense       Analysis    While debt ratio indicates total debt exposure relative to total assets, times interest earned  (TIE) ratio assesses whether the company is earning enough to pay off the associated interest  expense.    Higher value of times interest earned (TIE) ratio is favorable as it shows that the company  has sufficient earnings to pay off interest expense and hence its debt obligations.    Lower values highlight that the company may not be in a posit ion to meet its debt  obligations.     Net Profit Margin    Net profit margin (also called profit margin) is the most basic profitability ratio that measures  the percentage of net income of an entity to its net sales.    It represents the proportion of sales that is left over after all relevant expenses have been  adjusted.    A high ratio indicates that the company is profitable.     Formula   Net Profit Margin = Net Income /Net Sales     Return on Equity (ROE) Ratio    Return on equity is the ratio of net income to stockholder s' equity.    It is a measure of profitability of stockholders' investments.    It shows net income as percentage of shareholder equity.     Formula   ROE = Net Income /Stockholders' Equity      Net income is the after tax income , whereas    Shareholder  equity is common stock fund plus retained earnings     Analysis    High  ROE value mean s that the firm is effici ent in generating income on stock investment.    Investors should compare the ROE of different companies and check the trend over time.    ROE can be artificially influenced by the management, for example, when debt financing is  used to reduce share capital there will be an increase in ROE even if income remains  constant .    Earnings per Share (EPS)    Earnings per share (EPS) is a profitability indicator which shows dol lars of net income  earned by a company per share of its common stock    EPS is a very important profitability ratio, particularly for shareholders of a company,  because it is a direct measure of dollars earned per share.     Analysis    EPS standardizes earnings  with reference to number of shares outstanding.    However, EPS alone too is not very useful because different companies have different  number of shares.     Price/Earnings (P/E) Ratio    Price/Earnings or P/E ratio is the ratio of a company's share price to its earnings per share.    It tells whether the share price of a company is fairly valued, undervalued or overvalued.    A high P/E ratio indicates high growth prospects for the company.     Formula   P/E Ratio = Current Share Price /Earnings per Share       Dividend Payout Ratio    Dividend payout ratio is the percentage of a company’s earnings that it pays out to investors  in the form of dividends.    It is calculated by dividing dividends paid during a period by net earnings for that period.     Formula   Dividend Payout Ratio = Dividend per Share /Earnings per Share     Analysis    People invest in a company expecting a return on their investment which comes from two  sources: capital gains and dividends.    A high  dividend payout ratio means that the company is reinvesting less earnings in future  projects, which in turn means less capital gains in future periods.    Similarly, low payout ratio today may result in higher capital gains in future.    Some investors prefer companies that provide high potential for capital gains while others  prefer companies that pay high dividends.    Dividend payout ratio helps each class of investors identify which companies to invest in .    Inventory Turnover Ratio    Inventory turnover is an asset efficiency ratio which calculates the number of times per  period a business sells and replaces its entire batch of inventories.     Formula   Inventory Turnover = Cost of Goods Sold /Average Inventories     Analysis    Inventory turnover ratio assess es how efficiently a business is managing its inventories.    In general, a high inventory turnover indicates efficient operations.    A low inventory turnover compared to the industry average and competitors means poor  inventories manageme nt.   However, a very high value of this ratio may result in stock -out costs, i.e., when a business is  not able to meet sales demand due to non -availability of inventories.    Inventory turnover is a very industry -specific ratio. Businesses which trade perisha ble goods  have very higher turnover compared to those dealing in durables. Hence a comparison would  only be fair if made between businesses in the same industry.       Days' Sales Outstanding (DSO) Ratio    Days' sales outstanding ratio (also called average coll ection period  or days' sales in  receivables ) is used to measure the average number of days a business takes to collect its  trade receivables after they have been created.    It gives information about the efficiency of sales collection activities.     Formula   Days Sales Outstanding is calculated using following formula:     DSO =   Accounts Receivable   × Number of Days  Credit Sales     Analysis    A low value of Days Sales Outstanding is favorable indicating that the firm is collecting  money faster.     Total  Assets Turnover Ratio    Fixed assets turnover ratio measures how successfully a company is utilizing its  assets in  generating revenue.    It calculates the dollars of revenue earned per on e dollar of investment in assets.    A higher asset turnover ratio is gene rally better.   Formula   Assets Turnover Ratio = Sales/ Fixed Asset",6
27,"FINANCIAL ANALYSIS   Financia l Statements     The income statement provides information about  revenue and expenses of a firm,    The balance sheet provides a point in time snap shot of the firm’s assets, liabilities and  owner’s equity.     Benchmarking:  The financial statements by themselves are complex documents involving a  whole bunch of numbers.     One common method of benchmarking is to compare a firm’s current performance against  that of its own performance over a 3 -5 year period (trend analysis) , by l ooking at the growth  rate in various key items such as sales, costs, and profi ts.   Another useful way is to re state the income statement and the balance sheet into common  size statements, by expressing each income statement item as a percent of sales and ea ch  balance sheet item as a percent of total assets     Financial Ratios     Financial ratios allow for meaningful comparisons across time, between competitors, and  with industry averages.    Liquidity ratios : Can the company meet its obligations over the short term?    Solvency ratios : (also known as financial leverage ratios ): Can the company meet its  obligations over the long term?    Asset management ratios : How efficiently is the company managing its assets to g enerate  sales?    Profitability ratios : How well has the company performed overall?    Market value ratios : How does the market (investors) view the company’s financial  prospects?       Du Pont analysis : which involves a breakdown of the return on equity into its th ree  components, i.e. profit margin, turnover, and leverage.     Liquidity Ratios:  measure  a company’s ability to cover its short -term debt obligations in a  timely manner:    Three key liquidity ratios include the current ratio, quick ratio, and cash ratio.     Financial Leverage Ratios:  measure a company’s ability to meet its long -term debt obligations  based on its overall debt level and earnings capacity.    Failure to meet its interest obligation could put a firm into bankruptcy.    Key financial leverage ratios are  the debt ratio, times interest earned ratio, and cash coverage  ratio.     Asset Management Ratios:  measure how efficiently a firm is using its assets to generate  revenues or how much cash is being tied up in other assets such as receivables and inventory.    Key asset management ratios are inventory turnover, accounts receivables turnover, average  collection period, and total asset turnover.    Profitability Ratios:  such as net profit margin, returns on assets, and return on equity, measure a  firm’s effectivenes s in turning sales or assets into profits    Potential investors and analysts often use these ratios as part of their valuation analysis.     Market Value Ratios:  are used to gauge how attractive a firm’s current price is relative to its  earnings, growth rate, a nd book value    Typically, if a firm has a high price to earnings and a high market to book value ratio, it is an  indication that investors have a good perception about the firm’s performance.    If these ratios are very high it could also mean that a firm is over-valued.     DuPont analysis:  involves breaking down ROE into three components of the firm:    operating efficiency , as measured by the profit margin (net income/sales);    asset management efficiency , as measured by asset turnover (sales/total assets); and    financial leverage , as measured by the equity multiplier (total assets/total equity).         Questions   1. What is the accounting identity?   Assets ≡ Liabilities + Owner’s Equity     2. What does analyzing companies over time tell a finance manager?   Trend analysis tells a financial manager the rate at which the various key items are growing  and helps explain why profits are growing or eroding over time.     3. What does restating financial statements into common -size financial statements allow a  finance manager or financial analy st to do?   Common -size financial statements allow a comparison of companies that are very different in  size. It then allows comparison of management choices, such as debt financing or analysis of  production costs.     4. What are liquidity ratios? Given an exampl e of a liquidity ratio and how it helps  evaluate a company’s performance or future performance from an outsider’s view.   Liquidity ratios are ratios that show the short -term cash obligation capabilities of the  company. The current ratio is a liquidity ratio  and it is current assets divided by current  liabilities.

28,"Financial Statement Review:    Financial Statements Tutorial    There are four major financial statements used to communicate information to external users (creditors,  investors, suppliers, etc.)  -  1. Balance Sheet  (assets, liabilities, and Shareholder’s equity)  2. Income Statement (r evenues and expenses)  3. Statement of Changes in Shareholder’s E quity (contributed capital and retained earnings)   Statement of Retained Earnings  4. Statement of Cash Flows    Balance Sheet   Financial statement that presents the financ ial position of the company on a particular date.   Summarized by the accounting equation which must always be in balance  (Assets=Liabilities + Shareholder’s Equity)   Three categories of accounts:  1. Assets    Three Characteristics of Assets  a) It has probable future benefit that involves a ca pacity to contribute directly or indirectly to  future net cash flows  b) A particular entity can obtain the benefit  and control other’s access to the asset  c) The transaction that result ed in the entity’s right to the benefit of the asset has already  occurred   Examples: Cash, Accounts Receivable, Land, E quipment, Construction in Progress, Patents,  Copyrights, G oodwill, etc.    2. Liabilities   Amounts that company owes to its creditors   Examples: Notes Payable, Accounts  Payable, Unearned Revenue, etc.    3. Owner’s Equity (Stockholder’s Equity or Shareholder’s Equity)   The owner’s claims to the assets of the company   Includes both retained earnings and capita l stock (common stock,  preferred stock)   Most companies prepare a classified balance sheet which is the same as a regular balance sheet except assets  and liabilities are categorized as current and non-current.  1. Current—will be used or paid for within the next year   Examples:  1. Current Assets: Cash, A ccounts Receivable, Inventory  2. Current Liabilities: Accounts Payable, Unearned Revenue  2. Non-current asset—will not be used or paid for within the next year   Examples:  1. Non-Current Assets: Land, Notes Receivable, Equipment  2. Non-Current Liabilities: Notes Payable, Bonds Payable    Income Statement   Financial statement that reports the company’s revenues and expenses over an interval of time (usually one  accounting period)   Shows whether the company was able to generate enough revenue to cover the expenses of running the  business    Revenue - Expenses = Net Income or Net Loss   Revenues equal the selling price of a good or service   Expenses are costs incurred to earn revenue   Example: Tom sells Jane a t-shirt for $20.  It cost Tom $15.  Tom’s revenue is $20, his cost of goods sold  (expense) is $15, and his net income is $5.    Multiple Step Income Statement  (only used for merchandising companies)  Sales  -Cost of Goods Sold  Gross Profit  -Operating Expenses   Operating Income  +/- Miscellaneous   Net Income before taxes -Income Tax Expense  Net Income  Statement of Changes in Shareholder’s Equity    Contributed Capital and retained earnings     Retained Earnings :  Beginning Retained Earnings  Less Dividends  Plus Net Income or Minus Net Loss  Ending Retained Earnings    Statement of Cash Flows   Financial statement that measures activities involving cash  receipts and cash  payments over an interval of time  (usually one accounting period).    Cash flows can be classified into one of three categories:  1. Operating Activities  - day-to-day general activities to run the business   Examples:  Purchasing inventory for cash, selli ng inventory for cash, paying cash for a business  license, paying cash fo r utilities, etc. 2. Investing Activities  - purchase and sale of assets that last longer than one year   `Examples:  Purchasing land for cash, selling property for cash, etc.  3. Financing Activities  - cash transactions involvi ng a company’s long-term creditors or owners   Examples: Receiving cash from a bank loan, re ceiving cash from the issue of common stock,  receiving cash from the sale of bonds, paying cash for dividends, paying cash for principal on a  loan    Preparation of Financial Statements:  Example 1:  The following items were taken from the accounting records of Bowser Incorporated.

29,"Financial Statement Review:    Financial Statements Tutorial    There are four major financial statements used to communicate information to external users (creditors,  investors, suppliers, etc.)  -  1. Balance Sheet  (assets, liabilities, and Shareholder’s equity)  2. Income Statement (r evenues and expenses)  3. Statement of Changes in Shareholder’s E quity (contributed capital and retained earnings)   Statement of Retained Earnings  4. Statement of Cash Flows    Balance Sheet   Financial statement that presents the financ ial position of the company on a particular date.   Summarized by the accounting equation which must always be in balance  (Assets=Liabilities + Shareholder’s Equity)   Three categories of accounts:  1. Assets    Three Characteristics of Assets  a) It has probable future benefit that involves a ca pacity to contribute directly or indirectly to  future net cash flows  b) A particular entity can obtain the benefit  and control other’s access to the asset  c) The transaction that result ed in the entity’s right to the benefit of the asset has already  occurred   Examples: Cash, Accounts Receivable, Land, E quipment, Construction in Progress, Patents,  Copyrights, G oodwill, etc.    2. Liabilities   Amounts that company owes to its creditors   Examples: Notes Payable, Accounts  Payable, Unearned Revenue, etc.    3. Owner’s Equity (Stockholder’s Equity or Shareholder’s Equity)   The owner’s claims to the assets of the company   Includes both retained earnings and capita l stock (common stock,  preferred stock)   Most companies prepare a classified balance sheet which is the same as a regular balance sheet except assets  and liabilities are categorized as current and non-current.  1. Current—will be used or paid for within the next year   Examples:  1. Current Assets: Cash, A ccounts Receivable, Inventory  2. Current Liabilities: Accounts Payable, Unearned Revenue  2. Non-current asset—will not be used or paid for within the next year   Examples:  1. Non-Current Assets: Land, Notes Receivable, Equipment  2. Non-Current Liabilities: Notes Payable, Bonds Payable    Income Statement   Financial statement that reports the company’s revenues and expenses over an interval of time (usually one  accounting period)   Shows whether the company was able to generate enough revenue to cover the expenses of running the  business    Revenue - Expenses = Net Income or Net Loss   Revenues equal the selling price of a good or service   Expenses are costs incurred to earn revenue   Example: Tom sells Jane a t-shirt for $20.  It cost Tom $15.  Tom’s revenue is $20, his cost of goods sold  (expense) is $15, and his net income is $5.    Multiple Step Income Statement  (only used for merchandising companies)  Sales  -Cost of Goods Sold  Gross Profit  -Operating Expenses   Operating Income  +/- Miscellaneous   Net Income before taxes -Income Tax Expense  Net Income  Statement of Changes in Shareholder’s Equity    Contributed Capital and retained earnings     Retained Earnings :  Beginning Retained Earnings  Less Dividends  Plus Net Income or Minus Net Loss  Ending Retained Earnings    Statement of Cash Flows   Financial statement that measures activities involving cash  receipts and cash  payments over an interval of time  (usually one accounting period).    Cash flows can be classified into one of three categories:  1. Operating Activities  - day-to-day general activities to run the business   Examples:  Purchasing inventory for cash, selli ng inventory for cash, paying cash for a business  license, paying cash fo r utilities, etc. 2. Investing Activities  - purchase and sale of assets that last longer than one year   `Examples:  Purchasing land for cash, selling property for cash, etc.  3. Financing Activities  - cash transactions involvi ng a company’s long-term creditors or owners   Examples: Receiving cash from a bank loan, re ceiving cash from the issue of common stock,  receiving cash from the sale of bonds, paying cash for dividends, paying cash for principal on a  loan    Preparation of Financial Statements:  Example 1:  The following items were taken from the accounting records of Bowser Incorporated.

The statements of 432 cooperatives were used to compare 1995 to 1994, while 1,610 cooperatives were used to look at trends over the past 10 years. Cooperatives were divided into four groups based on their mix of net sales between supplies sold and farm products marketed. They were also divided into four size cate- gories, based on their total sales volume. Average net income increased 14 percent from 1994 to 1995. In 1995, average net sales for all cooperatives studied was $12.2 million, up 8 percent from 1994. More than 36 percent of the cooperatives studied were small cooperatives-sales of less than !§5 million. Cooperatives not only were important to their member/patrons, but also were an impor- tant asset to their rural communities. They were probably one of the community’s larg- er employers, employing an average 21 full-time and 9 part-time employees with an average annual payroll of $707,000. Petroleum products and fertilizer were the two principal farm supplies sold. Marketing activities (mainly grains and oilseeds) provided more than 54 percent of sales for these cooperatives. Average total assets grew 17 percent between 1994 and 1995, fueled by large increas- es in inventories. To finance the growth in assets (mainly inventories), total liabilities grew 31 percent while owner equities increased 5 percent. Interest expenses, although less than 1 percent of net sales, increased 42 percent largely due to increased short-term debt used to finance inventory buildup. Local sav- ings was down 24 percent, but with an increase of 37 percent in patronage refunds received, net income for these cooperatives was up 14 percent. Financial ratio analysis was used to look at 1 O-year trends for the 1,610 cooperatives in the data base. The financial ratio analysis revealed these findings: l The current ratio (current assets/current liabilities) was fairly steady around 1.5 between 1988 and 1994, with a slight downturn in 1995. The quick ratio (current assets-inventory/current liabilities) mimicked the current ratio’s trend. . Total debt-to-asset ratio was 0.25 in 1995, higher than most recent years but lower than the high of 0.3 in 1985. l The fixed-asset-turnover ratio, a measure of asset utilization, has averaged at least 9.1 for the past 3 years ( i.e., net sales were 9.1 times property, plant, and equipment levels). l Return on total assets measures the rate of return on total investments. At 8 percent, this measure was down slightly from 1994. l Return on allocated equity before taxes has grown dramatically in the decade from 5 percent to 14 percent. . . .111Analysis of Financial Statements: Local Farm Supply, Marketing Cooperatives E. Eldon Eversull and Beverly L. Rotan Rural Business-Cooperative Service U.S. Department of Agriculture Local agricultural cooperatives play a vital role in providing goods and services to their patrons and the rural community. This report analyzes their financial statements for comparative purposes for cooperative managers, directors, and members. Ratio analysis and trends will be discussed. The presentation is sub-divided into four cooperative sizes and types to make the information more useful. The 432 local cooperatives had farm supply sales (petroleum, fertilizer, feed, etc.) that averaged $5.6 mil- lion in 1995 while marketing sales (corn, wheat, soy- beans, etc.) averaged $6.6 million. Income from ser- vices (product delivery, fertilizer application, grains and oilseeds  hauling and storage, etc.) averaged SO.4 million per year. These cooperatives were not only important to, their member/patrons, but also an important asset to their rural communities. The cooperatives paid an average of $43,000 in annual property taxes. They were also a large employer in their communities, averaging 21 full-time and 9 part-time employees with an aver- age annual payroll of $707,000. Cooperative annual reports generally contain the balance sheet and a statement of operations. More detailed reports may contain a statement of changes in patrons’ equity and a statement of cash-flows along with explanations detailing various aspects of the financial statements. The manager and the president of the board of directors may also provide a statement on the cooperative’s past year operating results and future plans. This study focuses on the balance sheet, income statement, and financial ratios derived from these statements.Profile of Respondent Cooperatives Staff of the Cooperative Services (CS) program in USDA’s Rural Business-Cooperative Service annually survey farmer cooperatives. Data from this survey are used in this study. To be included, a cooperative had to sell some farm supplies. No cooperative that exclusive- ly markets members’ products was included. In addi- tion to selling farm supplies, the cooperative also had to provide an annual report that had a detailed income statement. There are 1,610 cooperatives in the CS Farm Supply and Services (FSS)  database. This report focus- es on 432 cooperatives that provided information in both 1995 and 1994 when comparing those years and on all 1,610 cooperatives when looking at long-term trends (1985 through 1993 ‘) in the financial ratio analysis section. To obtain a more complete under- standing of the local cooperatives’ business, informa- tion in this report is divided into a cross section of four sizes and four types. Cooperative Size Cooperatives were grouped into four sizes by sales volume, using actual figures. No attempt was made to deflate these values. Sales groupings used in this report were the same as in prior reports (see CS- RR 134 and RR 138) and, for the 432 cooperatives, sizes and types used are summarized in table 1. 1 The data in the FSS database does not include 1991. It was omitted in an effort to disseminate information in a more timely fashion. At the time, it was thought that information from 1991 would be included in the future, but as that information became less and less current, it is less likely to become part of the database. 1In classifying by total sales alone, product mix was ignored. For example, a cooperative with $10 mil- lion in sales that exclusively marketed grains and oilseeds  could be considered small relative to most grains and oilseeds  marketing organizations. But, a strictly farm supply cooperative with sales of $10 mil- lion, however, was quite substantial. Cooperative Type To account for differences in operations and ori- entation based on product mix, cooperatives were grouped into one of four descriptive categories: 1) farm supply; 2) mixed farm supply; 3) mixed market- ing; and 4) marketing. These descriptions were chosen to represent business operations of these cooperatives as closely as possible and their definitions summarized in table 1. This report focuses on cooperatives handling farm supplies-42 percent in 1995 sold only farm sup- plies; 16 percent were mixed; 24 percent were mixed marketing; and 18 percent were marketing (table 2). Of Table r-Size and type definitions used for respondent cooperatives Cooperative size Definition Number Small up to $5 million in total sales 156 Medium $5 million to $10 million 103 Large $10 million to $20 million 96 Super $20 million and more 75 Cooperative type Farm supply total net sales from farm supplies’ 161 Mixed farm supply from 50 to 99 percent 70 Mixed marketing from 25 to 49 percent 103 Marketing less than 25 percent 78 1 The definition of farm supply cooperatives differs from prior reports. These cooperatives now have 100 percent farm supply sales instead of 90 to 100 percent.the respondents, 36 percent were small; 24 percent, medium; 23 percent, large; and 17 percent, super. Both types of marketing cooperatives tended to be larger while the farm supply cooperatives were most often small. Most respondents were small farm supply coop- eratives. The first part of this report focuses on the 432 cooperatives that provided information in both 1995 and 1994. In the financial ratio analysis sections, data between the years were not completely comparable in that the same cooperatives did not respond to the CS survey every year. Information in the FSS database was not randomly selected and may not be statistically valid to draw industry-wide conclusions. However, the samples are large and represent a cross section of cooperatives selling farm supplies and marketing grains and oilseeds  throughout the United States. The information in this report also goes beyond 432 cooperatives and rural communities. These coop- eratives operated 643 branches and had a significant business impact on 1,075 rural communities in terms of taxes and employment (table 3). Super cooperatives that averaged almost five branch outlets impacted more rural communities. Marketing cooperatives had an average of two branch outlets. Sales Mix The respondent cooperatives had five major farm supply and two marketing categories (table 4). Petroleum was the dominant production supply item sold by small and medium cooperatives. Sales of small cooperatives, the most numerous, averaged $2.8 mil- lion in 1995. Farm production supplies represented the bulk (86 percent) of their sales. As cooperatives grew in size, the importance of farm supplies declined (64 percent for medium-sized cooperatives, 52 percent for large, and 32 percent for super).

Petroleum was the most important farm supply item sold, with feed a close second. Average sales of marketing and mixed marketing cooperatives were $22 million and $18 million, respec- tively, and much larger than both categories of farm supply cooperatives. As defined, marketing made up the majority of their sales. Feed, fertilizer, and crop protectants were the most important farm supplies sold for both types of marketing cooperatives. Balance Sheet Definitions Balance sheet assets represent what the coopera- tive owns and are usually listed in decreasing order of their liquidity--the time it would take to convert them to cash. Liabilities, or what the cooperative owes toothers, are usually presented in a similar decreasing order. Equity represents members’ investment in their cooperative. Current assets- These are the most liquid assets on the cooperative balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents represent monies either in the bank, in short-term investments, or on hand at the cooperative. Accounts receivable is money due the cooperative (i.e., a credit sale due from the customer in 90 days). Inventories are products the cooperative has purchased from patrons to market and supplies the cooperative hopes to sell to patrons. Prepaid expenses are those paid up-front and then expensed as period costs throughout the fiscal year (i.e., taxes or insurance). Investments in other cooperatives- represent equity held in regional cooperatives through whom local cooperatives market products or purchase supplies and equity in the Bank for Cooperatives or CoBank, their lending source. These investments are purchased Table z+-Average  and total number of branches Cooperative type Average Farm supply .92 Mixed farm supply 1.79 Mixed marketing 1.78 Marketing 2.33 All 1.43Total 55 122 178 177 643Cooperative size Average Total Small .36 55 Medium .95 96 Large 1.59 153 Super 4.52 339 Table &Average  farm supplies sold and products marketed as a percent of tOtSI Saks, and change from 1994 to1995 Item 1995 1994 change, 1994 to1995 Percent Farm supplies sold: Feed 9.22 10.17 1.48 Seed .90 .98 3.05 Fertilizer 10.45 10.44 12.10 Crop protectants 7.42 7.87 5.52 Petroleum products 12.64 13.20 7.23 Other 4.91 5.29 3.04 Total 45.54 47.95 6.33 Products marketed: Grains and oilseeds 53.79 52.05 25.59 Other .67 - - Total 54.46 52.05 9.10 Total sales 100.00 100.00 11.96 Based on sales of: $12,203,699 $10,900,239 3equity as well as equity (patronage) paid back to the cooperative based on use. The more sales through or purchases from the regional cooperative or borrowing from the bank, the larger the investment. Other assets are usually past due accounts receivable not yet con- sidered as bad debt losses. Property, plant, and equipment- are the fixed assets of the cooperative (i.e., grain bins, office equipment, warehouse, gas station). Accumulated depreciation is the sum of all the year’s depreciation expenses taken on the assets. Net property, plant, and equipment (PPQE)  is the book value of the fixed assets-their cost minus accumulated depreciation. Total assets- are what the cooperative owns-current assets, plus investments, plus net fixed assets equal total assets. Current liabilities- are obligations the cooperative must pay within the next year. Accounts payable is money owed, usually to suppliers (sometimes classi- fied as accounts payable-trade accounts). Accrued expenses and accrued taxes are unpaid expenses. They often include unpaid salaries and benefits earned by employees. Accrued taxes often include property and sales taxes that have been incurred but not yet paid. Other liabilities in this study are most often accounts payable-grains and oilseeds  delivered and sold to the cooperative by its patrons who have not yet been paid. Retired equity represents allocated equity that the board has approved to revolve to members but not yet paid as of the closing date of the books. This equity accu- mulated from past sales to or purchases from patrons-usually revolved to members on a set sched- ule (often 7 or more years later). Patronage refunds and dividends are monies declared but not yet paid to mem- bers for current use of the cooperative and for invest- ing in preferred stock. Cooperatives are required to pay at least 20 per- cent of their refunds in cash, with the rest becoming allocated equity to be revolved to the members at a later date. The refunds are based on cents per product (weight or bushel) sold and/or on a percent of the dol- lars of farm supplies purchased. The refunds are deter- mined by the board of directors. Dividends paid on preferred stock ownership are based on a set percent return on the investment. Current portion of Zong-term debt and seasonal short-term debt are the final current lia- bilities. They are money owed (principal) for borrow-ing money and for leases. Long-term debt typically is used to finance long-term assets, while short-term debt is usually used for operating or seasonal loans. Long-term debt- includes notes, bonds, mortgages, and leases not due within the current year. Member equities- are member and patron invest- ments in the cooperative. The two main types are allo- cated and unallocated. Allocated equity is assigned to members in one of two forms. Each member has one share and one vote. The other form includes noncash allocated certificates which are member investments in the cooperative based on use. Allocated equity could be classified as stock if the cooperative was incorporated or certificates of owner- ship if not incorporated. In most cases, cooperative stock or ownership certificates are not generally traded between members and, if sold, require board approval. Unallocated equity is the retained earnings of the cooper- ative and often thought of as nonmember-nonpatron- age business but can also be based on member business. Analysis of the Balance Sheet The balance sheet of a local cooperative states its financial position at the end of an operating period-a 1Zmonth  fiscal year. The balance sheet represents the cooperative’s assets, liabilities, member equity, and their relationship to each other. This report analyzes the balance sheets of 432 local cooperatives to provide examples of typical levels for assets, liabilities, and member equities for different sizes and types. Table 5 compares common size balance sheets for all respondents for 1995 and 1994. Appendix tables l-4 show common size balance sheets by size and type for 1995. In a common size balance sheet, each account is listed as a percentage of total assets. The dollar amount of total assets the balance sheets represent is listed at the bottom of the table. By cooperative size, total assets increased from $1.5 million for small coop- eratives to $16.2 million for super-size cooperatives (table 7). By cooperative type, total assets were $2.7 million for farm supply, $6.2 million for mixed farm supply, $7.8 million for mixed marketing, and $9 mil- lion for marketing (table 8). Current Assets Looking first at current assets, cash and cash equivalents as a percent of total assets decreased as cooperative size increased. For small cooperatives,cash was 7.4 percent of total assets. But, this dropped to From 1994 to 1995, current assets increased by 24 1.9 percent for super cooperatives. Farm supply cooper- percent.

By size, farm supply invento- ries increased about 10 percent more for large and super cooperatives and by type, about 5 percent more for both farm supply cooperatives. Grains and oilseeds inventories increased more than 55 percent for medi- um and super cooperatives. By type, they increased more than 50 percent for all but farm supply coopera- tives. There were also regional differences in inventory buildup. By looking at 103 cooperatives that had their grains and oilseeds  inventories increase more than 50 percent, 65 cooperatives were in Iowa, Minnesota, or Nebraska. In dollar terms, inventory increased $178 million, with $128 million in these three States. Part of this buildup was due to low grains and oilseeds  prices the prior year and farmers holding back sales. But a grain railcar  shortage in the upper Midwest also forced some cooperatives to resort to outdoor storage on the ground (with increased grain prices and especially corn prices, inventories of grains and oilseeds  can be expected to be much lower in FY 96). Interest expenses in the three States increased by $7 million, in part to finance these inventories. Local sav- ings fell $10 million and 30 cooperatives had losses in local income. Net income was up 16 percent for these cooperatives due to patronage refunds, so that only nine experienced losses. Accounts receivable in this study were farm sup- ply trade accounts, not grains and oilseeds  trade receivables. Farm supply and grains and oilseeds  trade receivables (“other” current assets) were separated to allow ratio analysis in a future section of this study. Accounts receivable for farm supply sales increased 7 percent, growing at about the same rate as the increase in farm supply sales. The age of accounts receivable refers to how long ago the sale that started this receivable was made. Most cooperatives have credit sales with discounts offered to promote prompt payment. Terms might be 2 percent-10 days, net 30 days (no discount). Discounts might be offered on all farm supply sales or on certain products. The terms and what products had discounts were not known, but 96 cooperatives listed their dis- count on sales, and it was 1.22 percent on total farm supply sales. The age of accounts receivable is known for 54 cooperatives for both years (table 6). Fifty-five percent were current. Another 14 percent were from 31 to 60 days old. The largest difference between the 2 years was nearly 12 percent of receivables were more than 6 months old compared with 8 percent in 1994.Table 6 Age of SCCOUM  receivable, 1995 and 1994 Accounts receivable age 1995 1994 Percent Current, 0 to 30 days 55.02 53.15 31 to 60 days 14.26 14.77 61 to 90 days 8.69 10.55 91 to 120 days 1.96 4.70 121 to 180 days 3.10 3.72 Greater than 6 months 11.63 7.70 Accounts written off this period 5.34 5.41 Based on accounts receivable of: $26,284,134  $24,160,885 Investments and Other Assets About 1.4 percent of cooperative’s total assets was invested in the Bank for Cooperatives or CoBank. Larger cooperatives and both types of marketing coop- eratives had comparable investments. Meanwhile, investments in other cooperatives dropped from a high of 26 percent for small cooperatives to 13 percent for super cooperatives. Across types, marketing coopera- tives had less invested than farm supply cooperatives. Other assets often included overdue accounts receiv- able and were generally less than 2 percent of total assets for all cooperative sizes and types (except large farm supply cooperatives, 4.2 percent). Property, Plant, and Equipment Net property, plant, and equipment (PP&E)  as a percent of total assets tended to be between 22 percent and 26 percent for all cooperative sizes. Net PP&E increased 6.5 percent from 1994. Cooperatives that handled grains and oilseeds  had higher dollar amounts of PP&E,  probably due to extensive grains and oilseeds  storage and handling facilities and, also, because these cooperatives were larger than farm sup- ply cooperatives. But, both farm supply cooperatives had growth in net W&E  of at least 9 percent while both marketing cooperatives were less than 5.5 per- cent. Current Liabilities Current liabilities grew 33 percent between 1994 and 1995. The largest increase was in notes payable- seasonal used to finance current operations, and usual- ly used for inventories, They grew from 11.2 percent of total assets to 16.5 percent. Farm supply cooperatives had a negligible change while mixed farm supply, mixed marketing, and marketing cooperatives all were up 5 percent.Table 7%Common  size balance sheets by cooperative size, 1995 Small Medium Large Super Assets Current assets Cash and cash equivalents Accounts receivable Inventories-grains and oilseeds -farm supplies Prepaid expenses Other current assets7.41 13.10 3.29 20.23 2.15 3.93Percent of fofal assets 4.59 3.03 14.05 11.96 11.38 18.46 14.11 12.68 64 63 5.07 6.541.93 9.07 31.21 9.15 .77 9.21 Total current assets Investments and other assets Investments-other cooperatives --Bank for Cooperatives50.11 50.04 53.50 61.34 26.20 22.51 17.95 12.72 .37 1.39 1.41 1.65 -total 26.57 23.90 19.36 14.37 Other assets 1.15 1.40 1.50 .53 Total investments & other assets Property, plant, and equipment At cost Less accumulated depreciation27.72 25.30 20.86 14.90 60.87 67.77 71.20 60.07 38.70 43.11 45.57 36.30 Net PP&E 22.17 24.66 25.64 23.76 Total assets 100.00 100.00 100.00 100.00 Liabilities and owner equities Current liabilities Current portion of long-term debt Notes payable-seasonal Accounts payable Patrons credii balances & other liabilities Accrued taxes Accrued expenses Patronage refunds (cash) Total current liabilities Long-term debt Total liabilities 27.86 37.73 47.11 58.76 Owner equities Allocated equity Unallocated equity1.76 3.05 4.11 3.12 6.35 9.29 13.09 22.19 6.38 5.88 6.09 4.35 6.19 9.13 12.94 18.74 .44 .55 .65 .71 1.30 1.42 1.65 1.52 1.31 1.38 1.31 1.10 23.73 30.70 39.84 51.73 4.13 7.03 7.27 7.03 53.64 45.70 39.58 30.02 18.50 16.57 13.31 11.22 Total owner equities 72.14 62.27 52.89 41.24 Total liabilities and owner equities Based on total assets of:100.00 100.00 100.00 100.00 $1,460,910 $3,558,985 $8,316,485 $16,249,985 7Table s-Common  Size balance sheets by cooperative type, 1995 Farm supply Mixed farm supply Mixed marketing Marketing Assets Current assets Cash and cash equivalents Accounts receivable Inventories-grains and oifseeds -farm supplies Prepaid expenses Other current assets Total current assetsPercent of total assets 5.34 2.78 2.66 2.30 13.59 15.15 10.41 7.09 0.00 16.32 27.53 35.66 23.11 12.33 9.79 6.16 2.05 .65 .68 .57 2.69 3.85 8.64 11.51 46.78 51.08 59.71 63.29 Investments and other assets Investments-other cooperatives -Bank for Cooperatives25.47 19.77 14.66 11.30 .72 1.39 1.67 1.69 -total 26.19 21.16 16.33 12.99 Other assets 2.12 1.31 .36 .63 Total investments & other assets Property, plant, and equipment At cost Less accumulated depreciation Net PP&E28.31 22.47 16.69 13.62 58.84 68.75 69.64 58.78 33.93 42.30 46.04 35.69 24.91 26.45 23.60 23.09 Total assets 100.00 100.00 100.00 100.00 Liabilities and owner equities Current liabilities Current portion of long-term debt Notes payable-seasonal Accounts payable Patrons credit balances & other liabilities Accrued taxes Accrued expenses Patronage refunds (cash)2.00 3.14 3.36 4.00 6.79 15.67 18.91 20.90 7.66 6.34 4.35 3.78 5.27 7.06 16.47 23.78 .51 .55 .76 .67 1.86 1.88 1.54 1.03 1.62 1.51 1.23 0.74 Total current liabilities Long-term debt Total liabilities Owner equities Allocated equity Unallocated equity Total owner equities Total liabilities and owner equities Based on assets of:25.71 36.15 46.62 54.90 7.42 7.81 5.97 6.77 33.13 43.96 52.59 61.67 52.05 45.05 32.67 26.52 14.82 10.99 14.74 11.81 66.87 56.04 47.41 38.33 100.00 100.00 100.00 100.00 $2,731,412 $6,180,969 $7,762,383 $9,046,959 8Patrons’ credit balances and other liabilities grew by 32 percent, mostly due to the inclusion of payables due on grains and oilseeds  trading and other market- ing activities. Accrued expenses and patronage refunds were the only other current liabilities that grew in double digits. Accrued expenses grew by 17.7 percent and were a slightly larger percentage of total assets for larger cooperatives and for both types of farm supply cooperatives. Cash patronage refunds and dividends grew by 15.5 percent, but was less than 2 percent of total assets for all sizes and types of cooperatives. Long-term Debt Long-term debt increased by 16.3 percent from 1994 to 1995. As a percent of total assets it generally increased with cooperative size, but interestingly, tended to be higher for both types of farm supply cooperatives. By type as a percent of total assets, long- term debt ranged from 6 percent to 7.8 percent with the farm supply cooperatives at the high end, about a percentage point higher than the marketing coopera- tives. Twenty-nine percent of the cooperatives had no long-term debt. About half were small farm supply cooperatives and combined together, farm supply cooperatives made up more than half. Nearly 66 percent of the cooperatives provided information that broke out four main sources of their $500 million total debt (short- and long-term com- bined)-Bank  for Cooperatives and CoBank,  commer- cial banks, debentures or notes, and other. A regional cooperative was most often the source in the “other” category. The local cooperative often purchases its farm supplies and markets its grains and oilseeds  through a regional cooperative, which becomes a source of debt capital. The debt may be short-term operating capital or long-term investment capital. Bank for Cooperatives and CoBank were the most frequent source of debt capital (59 percent). Others were regional cooperatives (32 percent), deben- tures or notes (5 percent), and commercial banks (4 percent). Most sources, except debentures and notes, extend lines of credit. Only 90 cooperatives reported their lines of credit for both years, but in total it increased by $20 million to $308 million in 1995. Of this line of credit, the unused portion fell by $20 mil- lion to $166 million in 1995. Member Equities Member equities to total assets represent the per- cent of the cooperative’s assets owned by the mem-bers, with creditors claiming the rest. Over all sizes and types of cooperatives, members averaged 50.3 per- cent ownership of the cooperative, down from 55.7 percent in 1994. Members of small cooperatives had the highest percentage of ownership (72.1 percent) while members of super-size cooperatives had the lowest (41.2 per- cent). By cooperative type, members of mixed farm supply cooperatives owned at least 56 percent of their cooperatives’ assets while farm supply cooperatives’ members owned more than 66 percent. Both types of marketing cooperatives had lower member owner- ship-38.3 percent for marketing and 47.4 percent for mixed marketing cooperatives. Member equities consisted of both allocated (pre- ferred, common, and other kinds of ownership certifi- cates) and unallocated equity. Allocated equity as a percentage of total assets was highest for small cooper- atives at 53.6 percent and more than 45 percent for both farm supply cooperatives. Unallocated equity averaged more than 13 per- cent of total assets for all sizes and types, but fell as cooperative size increased. By type, unallocated equity was around 15 percent of total assets for farm supply and mixed marketing cooperatives and around 11 per- cent to 12 percent for mixed farm supply and market- ing cooperatives. Description of Income Statement The income statement shows the results of opera- tions for the past year and usually includes both the current and prior year. It lists all sources of revenue and expenses. The statement measures the profitability of the cooperative for a given period of time. Although it does not show timing of cash-flows, the statement best describes the status of the business. In the analysis of income statements, net sales were set at 100 percent to find out the proportion that a single item represented in a total group or subgroup. Because the income statement variables were expressed as a percent of net sales, comparisons were possible between different sizes and types of opera- tions. Thus, the statement used in this report became known as a “common size” income statement. This statement was provided for the average cooperative respondent in table 9. The first item listed on the income statement net sales was the primary source of revenue-farm supplies sold and products marketed. Cost of goods sold (COGS) was the amount a cooperative paid for the products it sold and market- 9Table 9-hICOI?W  Statt?t?Wnt  and change in SCCOUntS,  19%  t0 1995 1995 1994 Percent change Net sales Cost of goods sold Gross margin Service and other income Gross revenue Operating expenses Employee: Salaries and wages Payroll taxes Employee insurance Pension expense Total Administrative: Professional services Office supplies (includes postage) Telephone, markets Meetings and travel Donations Dues and subscriptions Directors’ fees and expense Annual meetings expense Total General: Advertising and promotion Delivery (auto & truck) expense Insurance Property & Business taxes Other taxes and licenses Rent and lease expense Plant supplies & repairs Repairs and maintenance Utilities (includes dryer expense) Miscellaneous expenses Other expenses Total Depreciation Interest expense Bad debts Total expenses Local savings Patronage refunds received Savings before income taxes Less income taxes Net income Based on sales of:100.00 90.06 9.94 3.98 13.92Percent of net sales 100.00 89.87 10.13 3.79 13.927.82 8.05 5.83 13.26 7.85 4.69 4.36 15.97 .37 .36 9.31 .49 .50 6.78 .14 .14 12.94 5.69 5.36 7.16 .16 .13 34.45 .16 .16 7.72 .09 .09 7.18 .07 .07 7.52 .Ol .Ol 9.92 .03 .03 15.51 .03 .03 6.26 .02 .02 3.93 57 .54 13.66 .16 .16 8.81 .68 .63 16.27 .49 .51 2.83 .33 .34 3.55 .15 .17 (4.96) .20 .20 9.28 .22 .20 21.74 .68 .65 12.85 .49 .51 3.08 .12 .ll 17.21 .32 .39 (14.35) 3.84 3.87 18.00 1.53 1.54 7.33 .89 .68 42.42 .ll .lO 17.16 12.63 12.09 12.65 1.29 1.83 (23.98) 1.41 1.11 36.55 2.70 2.94 (1.03) .31 .68 (51 .Ol) 2.39 2.26 14.01 $12,187,025 $11,302,965 10ed-cost to the cooperative for the supplies sold and payments to farmers for products marketed. Net sales less COGS represented the gross margin on sales. Service and other income came mainly from pro- viding services to cooperative patrons. Service includ- ed delivery, chemical and fertilizer application, grain drying, and storage. Although substantial for some cooperatives, service income was not considered a pri- mary source of revenue. Operating expenses were those incurred in the course of conducting normal business. They were usu- ally classified by function like employee, administra- tive, general, and depreciation, interest, and bad debts. Local savings resulted from operations before taxes and patronage refunds from other cooperatives. Patronage refunds were based on volume of business conducted with another cooperative and were depen- dent on the other cooperative’s net income. Usually, this income was allocated equity and not actual cash coming into the respondent cooperatives. Net income was the end result of operations for that year. Distribution of net income was not part of the income statement. The board of directors decides how to distribute net income or allocate a net loss. Analysis of the Income Statement The income statement displays the net results of cooperative operations. Because most managers’ per- formance is judged by net income, members attach great importance to the income statement. In the fol- lowing sections, the underling values of the income statement are studied. Table 9 presents a common size income statement for 432 cooperatives and the change between 1994 and 1995. Appendix tables 5 to 8 show common size income statements by size and type for 1995. Net Sales The first item of the income statement analyzed in this report was net sales. It was determined by sub- tracting sales discounts and returns and allowances from gross sales. The average net sales for the 432 cooperatives in 1995 was $12.2 million, up $0.9 million or 7.8 percent from 1994. Net sales by cooperative size are presented in table 10, and by type in table 11. All sizes and types of cooperatives experienced a growth in net sales from 1994. If assets from tables 7 and 8 are compared to net sales in tables 10 and 11, sales for all types (except marketing) and sizes are about twice the level of assets.Cost of Goods Sold Cost of goods sold (COGS) represented the largest single component of expenses, usually expressed as a percent of net sales. For this study, COGS includes the beginning inventory plus purchas- es and freight costs, minus purchase returns and allowances, purchase discounts, and ending inventory. So, for these cooperatives, COGS was the purchase price of the farm supplies sold or products marketed. Table 11 shows COGS as a percent of net sales for the different types of cooperatives. Both types of market- ing cooperatives had a relatively high COGS when compared with farm supply cooperatives, which was to be expected because they were generally marketing grains and oilseeds  for their patrons with only a few cents per bushel margin. There was negligible change in COGS by cooperative size and type between the 2 years. Gross Margins Gross margins were the excess of net sales over the cost of goods sold. The gross margin averaged 9.9 percent for all cooperatives, down from 10.1 percent in 1994. The gross margin or gross margin percentage is a very important operating ratio. A small change in the gross margin has a tremendous impact on local sav- ings. A cooperative manager must maintain a gross margin near industry averages. Thus, least cost sources of supplies need to be developed and marketing coop- eratives must pay market rates on the products they purchase. Cooperatives are often characterized as business- es that provide goods and services “at cost.” However, a cooperative cannot operate at cost on a day-to-day basis. Therefore, unless a cooperative has an adequate gross margin, it can neither be profitable nor afford to finance essential future-directed discretionary expen- ditures such as expansion and advertising. Because by definition, gross margin equals net sales less cost of goods sold, those cooperatives with higher COGS had lower gross margins. COGS were higher for marketing and larger cooperatives, so gross margins as a percent of net sales were highest for farm supply and small cooperatives. Farm supply coopera- tives-16.7 percent-had the highest gross margin. Although both types of farm supply cooperatives had less business volume than those that performed mar- keting activities, their gross margin percentage was from 6 to 10 percentage points higher. Small coopera- tives, mostly selling farm supplies, had the highest gross margin by size (15.6 percent). 11Table w-Abbreviated income statement as a percent of net sales for cooperatives by size, 1995 Small Medium Large Super Percent of net sa/es Net sales 100.00 100.00 100.00 100.00 Cost of goods sold 64.36 67.66 89.08 91.98 Gross margin 15.64 12.34 10.92 a.02 Service and other income 3.63 4.16 4.07 3.94 Gross revenue 19.27 16.50 14.99 11.96 Expenses Employee 1 9.23 7.22 6.52 4.58 Administrative * 1.10 .79 .59 -44 General 3 4.35 3.78 3.56 3.35 Depreciation 2.11 1.97 1.74 1.46 Interest .68 .a2 .90 1.03 Bad debts .23 .24 .ia .06 Totalexpenses 17.70 14.82 13.49 10.92 Local savings 1.57 1.68 1.50 1.04 Patronage refunds received 2.36 1 .a4 1.49 1.12 Savings before income taxes 3.93 3.52 2.99 2.16 Less income taxes .24 .42 .49 .20 Net income 3.69 3.10 2.50 1.96 Based on total sales of: $2,599,834 $7,010,685 $13,819,360 !§37,104,303 t Employee expenses include salaries and wages, payroll taxes, employee insurance, unemployment compensation, and pension expense. 2 Administrative costs include professional services, office supplies, telephone, meetings and travel, donations, dues and subscriptions, directors’ fees and expense, and annual meetings. 3 General expenses include advertising and promotion, delivery (auto and truck), insurance, property, business and other taxes and licenses, rent and lease expenses, plant supplies and repairs, repairs and maintenance, utilities, miscellaneous, and other. Gross margins vary not only by cooperative, but also by farm supply sold or product marketed. Cooperatives, like other businesses, have different margins for different products. For 100 cooperatives that provided their individual product gross margins, these margins are shown in table 12. Margins vary due to product type and competition. For instance, fertiliz- er sold by the truckload has a different margin than a sale of a single bag. The services offered in conjunction with a sale (e.g., fertilizer spread on the field by a cooperative truck) have an impact on margin. Margins are also subject to competition. The gross margin dis- cussed in the first paragraph of this section is a blend- 12ed margin, made up of the margins of all products the cooperative sold, services rendered, and products mar- keted. The highest weighted (by volume) gross margin for the five main farm supplies was for fertilizer with a gross margin of almost 19 percent. The maximum mar- gin on fertilizer of 46 percent was for a small amount, probably a speciality fertilizer sold by the bag. Feed and petroleum margins were both around 17 percent. The margin of -302 percent on seed looks incorrect and needs further explanation. This margin was from a cooperative with more than $6 million in grains and oilseeds  sales that sold $1,500 of seed for $400.

For example, the two cooperatives with the lowest margins were located in close proximity and of course, in head-to-head competition. On further analysis, both cooperatives have been profitable over the past 5 years and have increased sales. They have even discussed merger, but membership has resisted this change. In this one instance, their low margins may be equated to low product prices-something that their members have noted by increasing their purchases from both cooperatives.Grains and oilseeds  were the only products mar- keted where gross margins were known. Grains and oilseeds  margins were low, only around 4 percent. Around 10 cooperatives reported high grains and oilseeds  margins of 18 and 19 percent. These high mar- gins were all at mixed farm supply cooperatives that had feed sales. It is suspected that the high margins resulted from the grain and oilseed  content in livestock feeds sold rather than the commodities themselves. Service and Other Income Service and other income, for the most part, con- sisted of trucking services (both delivery of purchases to patrons and transfer of their products to market), custom application of fertilizers and crop protectants, and drying and storing of grains and oilseeds.

This income averaged between 3.6 percent and 5 percent of net sales for all sizes and types of cooperatives. Other income was derived from non-operating sources such as interest and finance charges. This income included interest on cash equivalents and interest charged on credit sales. Other income also came from the sale of property, plant, and equipment, rentals, and extraordinary items. Sometimes property, plant, and equipment was sold to generate income, but usually it was the sale of a fully depreciated asset where the market value was greater than the book value. In some cases, disposal of a fully depreciated asset may mean a loss to the coop- erative. Rental income from unused facilities or equip- ment provided income flows. Extraordinary items might be either a gain or a loss. A gain could result from a fire loss where the insurance settlement was greater than the book value of the asset. A loss might be from flood damage for which the cooperative had no coverage. Operating Expenses Operating expenses were divided into four main categories-employee; administrative; general; and depreciation, interest, and bad debts. Employee expenses, of course, were related to labor costs. Administrative expenses included a variety of over- head costs associated with a cooperative and indirectly related to revenue production. General expenses were those directly related to revenue production, The bulk were in employee, general, and depreciation categories. 14Employee Expenses Employee expenses included salaries, wages, and benefits (payroll taxes, employee insurance, unem- ployment compensation, and pension expense) and averaged 5.7 percent of net sales for all respondent cooperatives. Employee expenses, up 7.2 percent from 1994, represented the smallest increase of all the major expense categories. As a percent of net sales, employee expenses decreased as cooperative size increased. This expense decreased from 9.2 percent of net sales for small coop- eratives to 4.6 percent for super cooperatives. By type, employee expenses as a percent of net sales were 9.6 percent for farm supply cooperatives and 3.4 percent for marketing cooperatives. About 62 percent of the cooperatives (268) pro- vided employee numbers and expenses (table 13). These expenses were for all employees. To equate part- time to full-time employees for purposes of this study, four part-time employees were considered as one full- time equivalent employee.3 Based on that calculation, the expense for a single employee averaged $30,119 for an average 19 employees, up 4 percent from 1994. By size, they ranged from $26,982 for small to $33,010 for super cooperatives and by type from $27,611 for those selling only farm supplies to $33,481 for mixed market- ing cooperatives. Small cooperatives averaged 8 actual full-time employees (excludes part-time), medium, 16; 3 Based on previous research conducted by CS economist David E.

Farm supply cooperatives averaged 14 employees, mixed farm supply, 28; mixed marketing, 25; and marketing, 19. Cooperatives with a significant proportion of their sales as farm supplies tended to be more labor intensive. Operating a feed mill or service station, applying chemicals and fertilizers, and selling hard- ware required the use of several employees. For instance, a small farm supply cooperative had 9 full- time employees while a small marketing cooperative used fewer employees-often only a manager, book- keeper, and two others. Administrative Expenses Administrative expenses were indirectly related to generating income. Managers usually had more con- trol over administrative expenses than any other cost. In years when revenues were down, managers could reduce expenses in this area more easily than in other categories. Administrative costs include professional services, donations, dues and subscriptions, directors’ fees and expenses, annual meetings, meetings and travel, office supplies, and telephone and market infor- mation.Professional services (such as legal, accounting, and computer) and office supplies both comprised 0.16 percent of net sales-the largest administrative expense. In total, administrative expenses were less than 0.6 percent of net sales. These expenses fell from a high of 1.1 percent for small cooperatives to 0.44 per- cent for super cooperatives. As cooperative size increased, the highest administrative expense, profes- sional services, fell as the cooperative relied more on its own employees to perform these tasks rather than purchase the services. Although directors’ fees and expenses were a small part of total costs, director compensation was important to many cooperatives to get farmers to sacri- fice time normally spent on their own operations to devote several hours of service each month to guiding their cooperative. Table 14 shows the number of direc- tors and their compensation for 282 cooperatives in 1995. Board expenses seemed rather modest, averaging $684  per director. The average board had seven direc- tors. By size, small cooperatives paid directors the least ($364) and super paid the most ($1,306). By type, mixed farm supply cooperatives paid the most at $1,087 per director. 15General Expenses General expenses were usually fixed in the short run and associated with income production. These expenses included advertising and promotion, deliv- ery (auto and truck), general insurance, property, busi- ness and other taxes and licenses, rent and lease expenses, plant supplies and repairs, repairs and main- tenance, utilities (including dryer expenses), miscella- neous, and other. Most of these expenses (with the exception of advertising and promotion) were not under direct management control. General expenses averaged 3.8 percent of net sales in 1995, Repairs and maintenance and delivery expenses at 0.68 percent of net sales were the largest in the general category, followed by insurance and utili- ties, both at 0.49. By cooperative size, general expenses were 4.4 for small cooperatives and 3.4 for super coop- eratives. By cooperative type, these expenses were around 5 percent of net sales for farm supply coopera- tives and around 3 for marketing cooperatives. Depreciation, Interest, and Bad Debts Depreciation expense averaged 1.5 percent of net sales; interest, 0.9 percent; and bad debts, 0.1 percent. By cooperative size, depreciation expense as a percent of net sales was 2.1 percent for small cooperatives and 1.5 percent for super cooperatives. By cooperative type, depreciation expense was 2.2 percent of net sales for farm supply cooperatives, 1.5 percent for mixed marketing, and 1.2 percent for marketing cooperatives. As discussed earlier, interest expenses, especially for short-term borrowing increased dramatically, going from 0.7 percent of net sales in 1994 to 0.9 percent in 1995. Interest expenses were lowest among small coop- eratives at 0.7, but grew to more than 1 percent for super cooperatives. By type, interest expenses were about 0.9 percent for all cooperatives except mixed farm supply which was highest at 1.1 percent.Bad debts as a percent of net sales fell as coopera- tive size increased-O.2 for small cooperatives and 0.1 for super cooperatives. By cooperative type, bad debts were 0.2 for both farm supply cooperatives and around 0.1 for both marketing cooperatives. Local Savings Local savings or local income was generated from own operations (before taxes and patronage refunds from other cooperatives). Local savings as a percent of net sales was highest for small cooperatives (1.6 per- cent) and lowest for super cooperatives (1 percent). By type, local savings was the highest for farm supply cooperatives (1.9 percent) and the lowest for market- ing cooperatives (0.8 percent). Small cooperatives, and especially farm supply cooperatives, had higher local savings than larger marketing cooperatives. About 24 percent of the cooperatives in this study had losses. While small cooperatives have higher returns on net sales, 50 or one-third of them lost money. Table 15 shows losses by size and type. Thirty percent of the mixed farm supply cooperatives lost money. Most likely to lose money were small mixed farm supply cooperatives (57 percent). Patronage Refunds Received Patronage refunds received or income from other cooperatives resulted from locals doing business with other cooperatives, generally regionals, or cooperative banks such as CoBank or the Bank for Cooperatives. The patronage refund from regionals was based on business volume and consisted of cash refunds and equity stock. The equity stock was usually revolved back to the local cooperative on a set schedule. Many respondent cooperatives also borrowed funds from CoBank and the Bank for Cooperatives and received both cash and noncash  patronage income.

Patronage refunds reflect the volume of business with regional cooperatives, CoBank or the Bank for Cooperatives. The dollar amount of patronage refunds between 1994 and 1995 was up 37 percent, suggesting 1995 must have been a good year for regional coopera- tives, CoBank, or the Bank for Cooperatives. Patronage refunds received were 2.4 percent of net sales for small cooperatives and 1.1 percent for super cooperatives. By cooperative type, patronage refunds received as a per- cent of net sales were higher for farm supply coopera- tives than for marketing cooperatives. Patronage refunds were an important source of revenues. They allowed 71 (out of 102) cooperatives that had local losses to have net income. Income Taxes Cooperatives paid income taxes on earnings not allocated to members (retained earnings) and on divi- dend payments. The decision as to what amounts of income that were allocated to retained earnings and to members was made by the board of directors. The treatment of nonmember business has an impact on retained earnings because the cooperative could allo- cate the earnings to nonmembers or retain the income. In terms of net sales, income tax paid was 0.3 percent of net sales in 1995. Income tax paid by cooperatives varied by size and type. Small cooperatives paid income taxes equal to 0.2 percent of their net sales, medium, 0.4; large, 0.5; and super, 0.2. All cooperatives except mixed market- ing ( 0.5 percent) paid 0.2 percent of their net sales in income taxes. Net Income Net income is the term used here for profits on cooperative income statements.

For small cooperatives it was 3.7 percent of net sales, medium, 3.1 percent; large, 2.5 percent; and super, 2 percent. By cooperative type, farm supply had returns of 4.1 percent on net sales, mixed farm supply had 3.2 percent, mixed marketing cooperatives, 2.1 percent, and marketing cooperatives, 1.5 percent. Net income (before taxes) was generally distrib- uted five ways-non-cash patronage allocations, cash patronage refunds, retained earnings, income taxes, and dividends on patron’s equity (table 16). Nearly 53 percent of net income before taxes was held as non- cash patronage allocations by the 287 cooperatives that provided income allocations. Cash patronage refunds were 22 percent. All distributions of income were basi- cally unchanged from 1994. Only 9 of the 287 coopera- tives reported dividends on preferred stock. The effec- tive interest paid was 3.22 percent. Financial Ratio Analvsis Looking beyond levels of assets, liabilities, mem- ber equities, sales, and expenses, cooperative man- agers and boards of directors need comparative mea- sures to evaluate their cooperative’s financial performance. Standard ratios were used in this report, includ- ing financial ratio analysis that allow performance comparisons between years and different cooperatives. No single financial indicator will provide enough information to determine a cooperative’s financial health. Therefore, ratios must be carefully interpreted. It is important to look at a group of financial ratios over a period of time, evaluate other cooperatives with similar sales and functions, and/or compare perfor- mance with other cooperatives in the same geographi- cal area. Ratios used in this study were often chosen because of their comparability with prior studies. Therefore, most figures show ratios for the 11-year period for all 1,610 cooperatives. Data for 1994 and 1995 reflect information gathered from the same 432 cooperatives that reported for both years. Performance ratios measure various levels of cooperative operations and generally have both a financial and operational impact. Four categories were used-liquidity, leverage, activity, and profitability. Many factors underlie each ratio and examining one ratio may not help pinpoint problems. Net income before taxes: Number of cooperatives:$101,171,588  $94,112,032 287 330 17Liquidity Ratios Liquidity ratios, such as current and quick, mea- sure the cooperative’s ability to meet short-term oblig- ations. They focus on the cooperative’s ability to remain solvent. The current ratio is current assets divided by current liabilities. However, this ratio does not consider the degree of liquidity of each of the com- ponents of current assets. In other words, if the current assets of a cooperative were mainly cash, they would be much more liquid than if comprised of mainly inventory. If the ratio is less than 1, current liabilities exceed current assets and the cooperative’s liquidity is threat- Figure i-Current and Quick Ratios Ratio 21 4-=-Quick 0 ’IIIIIIIII 1985 868788899092939495ened.  Improvements in this ratio can be achieved by selling additional capital stock, borrowing additional long-term debt, or disposing of unproductive fixed assets and retaining proceeds. Current liabilities may also be reduced by retaining a greater portion of allo- cated savings (reducing the cash portion). A high current ratio is a favorable condition financially because it indicates the ability to pay cur- rent liabilities from the conversion of current assets into cash. Operationally, this same high ratio tends to increase operating freedom and reduce the probability of bill-paying difficulty from writedowns of accounts receivable or inventory. Figure 1 shows the current and quick ratios for the surveyed cooperatives. The current ratio was relatively constant for 3 years before it took a slight downturn in 1995. The total current assets increased 24 percent while total current liabilities increased 33 percent. From 1994 to 1995, grains and oilseeds  and farm sup- ply inventories and dividends on equity were the only elements of current liabilities that grew. Higher grain and oilseed  inventories are probably causing the 32- percent increase in patron credit balances and other liabilities (which contains grain trade payables). The current ratio fell as cooperative size increased. The ratio was highest for small cooperatives (2.11) and fell to 1.19 for super cooperatives (table 17). By cooper- ative type, the ratio was 1.15 for marketing coopera- tives and 1.82 for farm supply cooperatives (table 18). Quick ratio is current assets minus inventories, divided by current liabilities. Inventories are exclud- ed-the least liquid of all current assets. All elements of this ratio have increased.

Operationally, the results are the same as with current ratio. The quick ratio mimicked the movement of the current ratio. Small cooperatives (1.12) had the highest ratio and it decreased as size increased to 0.41 for super cooperatives (table 17). The quick ratio ranged from a low of 0.39 for marketing cooperatives to a high of 0.92 for farm supply cooperatives. This ratio was highest in 1986 and lowest in 1995 (figure 1).

They help to analyze the use of debt and the ability to meet obligations in times of crisis. Debt-to-asset ratio is defined as total debt divided by total assets. Elements of this ratio include long-term debt plus short-term debt and total assets. Long-term debt increased at the same rate as total assets, which may indicate some short-term obligations were being carried and converted to long-term debt. With invento- ries increasing in the short term, quick financing is needed, usually through the use of short-term debt. In fact, short-term debt increased 72 percent between 1994 and 1995 (table 5). Lenders would rather see a low ratio indicating the cooperative’s ability to repay the loan. Overall, this ratio increased from .21 to .27 because assets increased by 17 percent while debt increased by almost one-half (figure 2). Reducing debt, increasing savings, or financing a greater portion of assets with working capital may improve this ratio. Larger cooperatives were financing more of their assets with debt, but the highest ratio for any size or type of cooperative was still only 0.32 (table 17). Small cooperatives had the lowest use of debt at 0.12. Debt usage was highest for marketing cooperatives at 0.32. This was twice the ratio for farm supply cooperatives. By type, farm supply cooperatives had the lowest use of debt. Debt-to-equity ratio is calculated by dividing long- term debt by member equity. This ratio shows the financial flexibility and the long-term capital structure of the cooperative. High ratios indicate inadequate borrowing power of the cooperative.

A low ratio is more favorable and finan- cially impacts the cooperative through independence on outside sources of funds relative to owners’ equity. A low ratio may also have an unfavorable impact indi- cating low return on equity. Operationally, a low ratio tends to reduce interest cost. Improvement may be gained by reducing long-term debt by disposing of unproductive assets and using proceeds to liquidate debt, or accelerating payments on long-term loans. Other ways include increasing local equity by generat- ing higher levels of local savings, slowing down equity retirement programs, selling additional capital stock, or retaining a greater portion of allocated savings. As cooperative size grew, so did their use of long- term debt. The ratio for small cooperatives was 0.06 Table w-Financial analysis ratios for all cooperatives, 1995and1994 Ratio 1995 1994 Current 1.32 1.41 Quick 0.52 0.65 Debts-to-assets 0.27 0.21 Debt-to-equity 0.14 0.12 Times-interest-earned 3.65 4.65 Total-asset-turnover 2.16 2.34 Fixed-asset-turnover 6.93 8.83 Gross profit margin 9.94 10.13 Return on total assets before interest &taxes 8.04 8.66 Return on allocated equity 13.96 12.65 Figure %--Debt-To-Equity Ratio Percent 0.35 0.30 0.25 1985 86 67 88 89 90 92 93 94 95 20and 0.17 for super cooperatives (table 17). Marketing cooperatives had, at 0.18, the highest ratio by type, while farm supply cooperatives were the lowest at 0.11. When looking at the trend, the ratio increased slightly each year from 1992 to 1995, but is much lower than prior years (figure 3). Times-interest-earned ratio  is the number of times interest expense is covered by earnings. It is calculated by dividing earnings before interest and taxes by inter- est expense. A ratio of one or more indicates the ability of current earnings to pay current interest expenses. Lending institutions are more apt to loan to coopera- tives whose times-interest-earned ratio is more than one (1) because it shows their ability to pay interest payments. Subsequently, a lending institution may lend funds at lower rates more readily for capital improvements. Times-interest-earned ratio was higher for respondent cooperatives in 1993 before starting a slight downward trend for the next 2 years (figure 4). This ratio may be improved by collecting old receiv- ables, improving inventory turnover, disposing of assets and reducing debt with proceeds, or reducing debt with working capital. Financially, a high ratio impacts the return on equity and tends to increase it. Over time operationally, a high ratio will reduce inter- est cost. Interest coverage was the greatest for smaller cooperatives and generally fell as cooperative size increased to super cooperatives (table 17). By coopera- tive type, the ratio ranged from 2.81 for marketing to 6.04 for farm supply. Figure 4-Times-interest-Earned  Ratio Ratio ” 1985 86 87 88 89 90 92 93 94 95Activity Ratios Activity ratios measure how well cooperatives use assets. A low ratio could mean that the cooperative was overcapitalized or carrying too much inventory. A high ratio could be deceptive. A cooperative with fully depreciated older assets could have an artificially high ratio even though those assets were no longer operat- ing efficiently. Total-asset-turnover ratio was found by dividing net sales by total cooperative assets. This ratio has gone down slightly from 2.34 in 1994 to 2.16 in 1995 (figure 5). Both elements of this ratio increased-total sales by 8 percent and total assets by 17 percent. A high ratio exerts a favorable financial influence through the reduction of financial leverage and/or increased return on equity. A high ratio operationally tends to reduce interest costs. The ratio was higher for larger cooperatives (table 17). Super cooperatives had the highest ratio at 2.28, indicating the most efficient use of assets. By cooperative type, the total asset turnover ratio was higher for marketing than farm supply. The total asset turnover ratio was lowest in 1995 at 2.16 and highest in 1989 at 3.01. Fixed-asset-turnover ratio represents net sales divided by net property, plant, and equipment (PP&E). This ratio is similar to the total asset turnover ratio and shows how well the cooperative is using its fixed assets. This ratio by itself might not give a complete picture of the cooperative’s financial health. A cooper- ative with fully depreciated assets would have an arti- Figure ti--Total-  and Fixed-Asset-Turnover Ra tie 12 1 10 “I6 Total-asset-turnover 4 2-0’ ’I I 1 I I I I I I 1985a6a788a99092939495ficially  high ratio. A cooperative that invested heavily in PP&E  for future expansion will have a temporarily low ratio. After a high in 1989 of 10.20, this ratio has remained relatively level for the 1990s. In 1995, the ratio was 8.93 and increased slightly from 1994 because sales increased 8 percent while investment in fixed assets increased 7 percent. The measure for this ratio may or may not show favorable or unfavorable conditions. It simply reflects cooperative conditions. An abnormally high ratio usually indicates very old, nearly depreciated fixed assets or the leasing of prop- erty and equipment. A high ratio financially exerts a favorable influ- ence by increasing asset use, reducing financial lever- age, and/or increasing return on equity. A high ratio, operationally, tends to reduce depreciation and interest costs. It may also increase costs related to operating leases, personnel and travel or delivery expenses. This ratio may be improved by restricting further invest- ments in fixed assets; redesigning production, or office facilities to increase the sales generating potential of existing space and equipment; and/or selling idle machinery and parts, unused vehicles, and unneces- sary equipment. By size, a fixed-asset-turnover ratio of 9.61 was greatest for super cooperatives. By type, the ratio was the highest (10.49) for marketing cooperatives. The fixed-asset-turnover ratio was at its lowest in 1987 (fig- ure 51. Profitability Ratios Profitability ratios, such as gross profit margin, indicate the efficiency of the cooperative’s operations. Because a cooperative is owned by its user-members, many common industry profitability ratios have little meaning. For instance, profitability ratios measuring the return on common or preferred stock of similar investor-oriented firms are not appropriate because there is seldom an open market for cooperative stock. Gross profit margin is found by subtracting the cost of goods sold from, net sales and then dividing this amount (gross margin) by net sales. The gross profit margin is an important operating ratio. A small change in the gross margin has a tremendous impact on local savings. It indicates the cooperative’s pricing policy and cost of goods offered for sale. For all cooperatives, the gross profit margin aver- aged 9.94 percent in 1995. The gross profit margin was the highest for respondent cooperatives in 1993 at 10.76 percent (figure 6). By size, gross profit margin diminished as cooperative sales grew. At 15.64 percent, 21small cooperatives had the highest gross margin. By type, farm supply and mixed farm supply coopera- tives, at 16.68 percent and 14.94 percent, had the high- est margins in 1995 (table 18). Return on total assets measures the rate of return on total investment. It is calculated by dividing net income by total assets and usually calculated before interest and taxes. This ratio is a measure of perfor- mance. It is not sensitive to the leverage position of the cooperative. Although some assets were financed through debt, the ratio measures return to both mem- bers and lenders. This ratio declined by 0.62 percent to 8.04 percent between 1994 and 1995 (table 19). Net savings (before income taxes) declined 1 per- cent while interest expense increased 42 percent dur- ing the 2-year period (table 9). For the decade, this ratio was highest in 1992 and 1995 and has been fairly constant (figure 7). Operationally, a high ratio tends to reduce interest cost and financially indicates a compar- atively high rate of return on assets employed. Medium and large cooperatives had a higher return on total assets (table 17). Medium-sized cooper- atives were slightly higher at 8.54 percent. By coopera- tive type, return on total assets was highest for farm supply cooperatives at 9.27 percent. Assets relative to revenue were higher for both types of farm supply cooperatives. Return on allocated equity is net income divided by allocated equity. It was determined by subtracting unallocated equity from total member equities. It rep- resents member investment in their cooperative and is an important measure of profitability. Figure 6- Gross Profit Margin Percent ‘*tiThis ratio increased 1 percent in 1995 (table 19). This ratio is sensitive to the amount of debt capital in the cooperative and best used in conjunction with other measures such as the return on total assets. Net savings increased 14 percent while allocated equity increased 3 percent from 1994 to 1995. Financially, a high ratio is favorable and tends to decrease financial leverage. However, a high ratio may also be a symptom of low investment adequacy. Operationally, a high ratio tends to reduce interest cost over time but may occur when both total debt and interest costs are on the high side. By size, this ratio increased as the cooperative grew in size. Super cooperatives had the highest return on allocated equity (14.92 percent). Farm supply and mixed farm supply cooperatives ratios were 14.06 per- cent and 13.35 percent and marketing and mixed mar- keting cooperatives were 13.51 percent and 14.65 per- cent (table 18). Summary and Conclusions Local cooperatives studied in this report general- ly had strong financial statements. Assets increased 17 percent from 1994 to 1995. More than half of the accounts receivable were less than 30 days old. Investment in W&E  grew 7 percent. Owner equities grew 5 percent and member ownership in the local exceeds 50 percent. Net sales grew 8 percent. Total expenses grew 13 percent while net income grew slightly faster, at 14 percent.

They are also important to rural communities, often one of the largest employers, and provide considerable tax revenues. The extensive consolidation of local cooperatives during the past two decades reflects attempts to maintain an adequate size from which to provide their members with expanded products and markets. Despite consolidation, coopera- tives studied maintained an average of two branch locations from which to better serve members. These cooperatives maintained strong ties to regional cooperatives, CoBank  or the Bank for Cooperatives through which they obtained products, gained marketing opportunities, or borrowed needed capital. Investment in other cooperatives rose 8 percent from 1994. In turn, patronage refunds to local coopera- tives from regionals and the banks increased 37 per- cent and made the year profitable for 71 cooperatives that would have otherwise had losses. But, local coop- eratives cannot depend on large patronage refunds and with numerous locals losing money, further con- solidation of locals may be necessary in the future. An area of concern in the financial statements was the large buildup in inventories and subsequent increases in short-term debt. Grains and oilseeds inventories increased 51 percent; short-term debt climbed 72 percent and pushed up interest costs 42 percent. Inventory buildup and the subsequent growth in assets financed through additional debt had an impact on much of the ratio analysis: 1) Liquidity ratios, current and quick, declined slightly in 1995 due to increased grains and oilseeds  and farm supply inventories; 2) Leverage ratios-debt-to-total assets ratio, jumped from 0.21 in1994 to0.27 in1995 because assets increased 17 percent while debt increased almost 50 percent; 3) Activity ratios-total-asset-turnover ratio fell from 2.34 in 1994 to 2.16 in 1995 because total sales increased only 8 percent while assets increased 17 percent with much of the increase in inventories; and finallyBut increases in inventories are not expected to be a long-term trend. More current information sug- gests the inventory problem will be a non-issue in FY 1996. Prices for most grains and oilseeds  increased greatly this past year and most inventories were prob- ably liquidated to capture the higher prices. Other pressing issues are sure to arise in the coming year. Cooperatives are owned by their farmer/member/patrons. As long as those farmers want to own a business where they can purchase their supplies and market their products, cooperatives will continue to adapt to changing economic conditions.

The statements of 432 cooperatives were used to compare 1995 to 1994, while 1,610 cooperatives were used to look at trends over the past 10 years. Cooperatives were divided into four groups based on their mix of net sales between supplies sold and farm products marketed. They were also divided into four size cate- gories, based on their total sales volume. Average net income increased 14 percent from 1994 to 1995. In 1995, average net sales for all cooperatives studied was $12.2 million, up 8 percent from 1994. More than 36 percent of the cooperatives studied were small cooperatives-sales of less than !§5 million. Cooperatives not only were important to their member/patrons, but also were an impor- tant asset to their rural communities. They were probably one of the community’s larg- er employers, employing an average 21 full-time and 9 part-time employees with an average annual payroll of $707,000. Petroleum products and fertilizer were the two principal farm supplies sold. Marketing activities (mainly grains and oilseeds) provided more than 54 percent of sales for these cooperatives. Average total assets grew 17 percent between 1994 and 1995, fueled by large increas- es in inventories. To finance the growth in assets (mainly inventories), total liabilities grew 31 percent while owner equities increased 5 percent. Interest expenses, although less than 1 percent of net sales, increased 42 percent largely due to increased short-term debt used to finance inventory buildup. Local sav- ings was down 24 percent, but with an increase of 37 percent in patronage refunds received, net income for these cooperatives was up 14 percent. Financial ratio analysis was used to look at 1 O-year trends for the 1,610 cooperatives in the data base. The financial ratio analysis revealed these findings: l The current ratio (current assets/current liabilities) was fairly steady around 1.5 between 1988 and 1994, with a slight downturn in 1995. The quick ratio (current assets-inventory/current liabilities) mimicked the current ratio’s trend. . Total debt-to-asset ratio was 0.25 in 1995, higher than most recent years but lower than the high of 0.3 in 1985. l The fixed-asset-turnover ratio, a measure of asset utilization, has averaged at least 9.1 for the past 3 years ( i.e., net sales were 9.1 times property, plant, and equipment levels). l Return on total assets measures the rate of return on total investments. At 8 percent, this measure was down slightly from 1994. l Return on allocated equity before taxes has grown dramatically in the decade from 5 percent to 14 percent. . . .111Analysis of Financial Statements: Local Farm Supply, Marketing Cooperatives E. Eldon Eversull and Beverly L. Rotan Rural Business-Cooperative Service U.S. Department of Agriculture Local agricultural cooperatives play a vital role in providing goods and services to their patrons and the rural community. This report analyzes their financial statements for comparative purposes for cooperative managers, directors, and members. Ratio analysis and trends will be discussed. The presentation is sub-divided into four cooperative sizes and types to make the information more useful. The 432 local cooperatives had farm supply sales (petroleum, fertilizer, feed, etc.) that averaged $5.6 mil- lion in 1995 while marketing sales (corn, wheat, soy- beans, etc.) averaged $6.6 million. Income from ser- vices (product delivery, fertilizer application, grains and oilseeds  hauling and storage, etc.) averaged SO.4 million per year. These cooperatives were not only important to, their member/patrons, but also an important asset to their rural communities. The cooperatives paid an average of $43,000 in annual property taxes. They were also a large employer in their communities, averaging 21 full-time and 9 part-time employees with an aver- age annual payroll of $707,000. Cooperative annual reports generally contain the balance sheet and a statement of operations. More detailed reports may contain a statement of changes in patrons’ equity and a statement of cash-flows along with explanations detailing various aspects of the financial statements. The manager and the president of the board of directors may also provide a statement on the cooperative’s past year operating results and future plans. This study focuses on the balance sheet, income statement, and financial ratios derived from these statements.Profile of Respondent Cooperatives Staff of the Cooperative Services (CS) program in USDA’s Rural Business-Cooperative Service annually survey farmer cooperatives. Data from this survey are used in this study. To be included, a cooperative had to sell some farm supplies. No cooperative that exclusive- ly markets members’ products was included. In addi- tion to selling farm supplies, the cooperative also had to provide an annual report that had a detailed income statement. There are 1,610 cooperatives in the CS Farm Supply and Services (FSS)  database. This report focus- es on 432 cooperatives that provided information in both 1995 and 1994 when comparing those years and on all 1,610 cooperatives when looking at long-term trends (1985 through 1993 ‘) in the financial ratio analysis section. To obtain a more complete under- standing of the local cooperatives’ business, informa- tion in this report is divided into a cross section of four sizes and four types. Cooperative Size Cooperatives were grouped into four sizes by sales volume, using actual figures. No attempt was made to deflate these values. Sales groupings used in this report were the same as in prior reports (see CS- RR 134 and RR 138) and, for the 432 cooperatives, sizes and types used are summarized in table 1. 1 The data in the FSS database does not include 1991. It was omitted in an effort to disseminate information in a more timely fashion. At the time, it was thought that information from 1991 would be included in the future, but as that information became less and less current, it is less likely to become part of the database. 1In classifying by total sales alone, product mix was ignored. For example, a cooperative with $10 mil- lion in sales that exclusively marketed grains and oilseeds  could be considered small relative to most grains and oilseeds  marketing organizations. But, a strictly farm supply cooperative with sales of $10 mil- lion, however, was quite substantial. Cooperative Type To account for differences in operations and ori- entation based on product mix, cooperatives were grouped into one of four descriptive categories: 1) farm supply; 2) mixed farm supply; 3) mixed market- ing; and 4) marketing. These descriptions were chosen to represent business operations of these cooperatives as closely as possible and their definitions summarized in table 1. This report focuses on cooperatives handling farm supplies-42 percent in 1995 sold only farm sup- plies; 16 percent were mixed; 24 percent were mixed marketing; and 18 percent were marketing (table 2). Of Table r-Size and type definitions used for respondent cooperatives Cooperative size Definition Number Small up to $5 million in total sales 156 Medium $5 million to $10 million 103 Large $10 million to $20 million 96 Super $20 million and more 75 Cooperative type Farm supply total net sales from farm supplies’ 161 Mixed farm supply from 50 to 99 percent 70 Mixed marketing from 25 to 49 percent 103 Marketing less than 25 percent 78 1 The definition of farm supply cooperatives differs from prior reports. These cooperatives now have 100 percent farm supply sales instead of 90 to 100 percent.the respondents, 36 percent were small; 24 percent, medium; 23 percent, large; and 17 percent, super. Both types of marketing cooperatives tended to be larger while the farm supply cooperatives were most often small. Most respondents were small farm supply coop- eratives. The first part of this report focuses on the 432 cooperatives that provided information in both 1995 and 1994. In the financial ratio analysis sections, data between the years were not completely comparable in that the same cooperatives did not respond to the CS survey every year. Information in the FSS database was not randomly selected and may not be statistically valid to draw industry-wide conclusions. However, the samples are large and represent a cross section of cooperatives selling farm supplies and marketing grains and oilseeds  throughout the United States. The information in this report also goes beyond 432 cooperatives and rural communities. These coop- eratives operated 643 branches and had a significant business impact on 1,075 rural communities in terms of taxes and employment (table 3). Super cooperatives that averaged almost five branch outlets impacted more rural communities. Marketing cooperatives had an average of two branch outlets. Sales Mix The respondent cooperatives had five major farm supply and two marketing categories (table 4). Petroleum was the dominant production supply item sold by small and medium cooperatives. Sales of small cooperatives, the most numerous, averaged $2.8 mil- lion in 1995. Farm production supplies represented the bulk (86 percent) of their sales. As cooperatives grew in size, the importance of farm supplies declined (64 percent for medium-sized cooperatives, 52 percent for large, and 32 percent for super).

Petroleum was the most important farm supply item sold, with feed a close second. Average sales of marketing and mixed marketing cooperatives were $22 million and $18 million, respec- tively, and much larger than both categories of farm supply cooperatives. As defined, marketing made up the majority of their sales. Feed, fertilizer, and crop protectants were the most important farm supplies sold for both types of marketing cooperatives. Balance Sheet Definitions Balance sheet assets represent what the coopera- tive owns and are usually listed in decreasing order of their liquidity--the time it would take to convert them to cash. Liabilities, or what the cooperative owes toothers, are usually presented in a similar decreasing order. Equity represents members’ investment in their cooperative. Current assets- These are the most liquid assets on the cooperative balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents represent monies either in the bank, in short-term investments, or on hand at the cooperative. Accounts receivable is money due the cooperative (i.e., a credit sale due from the customer in 90 days). Inventories are products the cooperative has purchased from patrons to market and supplies the cooperative hopes to sell to patrons. Prepaid expenses are those paid up-front and then expensed as period costs throughout the fiscal year (i.e., taxes or insurance). Investments in other cooperatives- represent equity held in regional cooperatives through whom local cooperatives market products or purchase supplies and equity in the Bank for Cooperatives or CoBank, their lending source. These investments are purchased Table z+-Average  and total number of branches Cooperative type Average Farm supply .92 Mixed farm supply 1.79 Mixed marketing 1.78 Marketing 2.33 All 1.43Total 55 122 178 177 643Cooperative size Average Total Small .36 55 Medium .95 96 Large 1.59 153 Super 4.52 339 Table &Average  farm supplies sold and products marketed as a percent of tOtSI Saks, and change from 1994 to1995 Item 1995 1994 change, 1994 to1995 Percent Farm supplies sold: Feed 9.22 10.17 1.48 Seed .90 .98 3.05 Fertilizer 10.45 10.44 12.10 Crop protectants 7.42 7.87 5.52 Petroleum products 12.64 13.20 7.23 Other 4.91 5.29 3.04 Total 45.54 47.95 6.33 Products marketed: Grains and oilseeds 53.79 52.05 25.59 Other .67 - - Total 54.46 52.05 9.10 Total sales 100.00 100.00 11.96 Based on sales of: $12,203,699 $10,900,239 3equity as well as equity (patronage) paid back to the cooperative based on use. The more sales through or purchases from the regional cooperative or borrowing from the bank, the larger the investment. Other assets are usually past due accounts receivable not yet con- sidered as bad debt losses. Property, plant, and equipment- are the fixed assets of the cooperative (i.e., grain bins, office equipment, warehouse, gas station). Accumulated depreciation is the sum of all the year’s depreciation expenses taken on the assets. Net property, plant, and equipment (PPQE)  is the book value of the fixed assets-their cost minus accumulated depreciation. Total assets- are what the cooperative owns-current assets, plus investments, plus net fixed assets equal total assets. Current liabilities- are obligations the cooperative must pay within the next year. Accounts payable is money owed, usually to suppliers (sometimes classi- fied as accounts payable-trade accounts). Accrued expenses and accrued taxes are unpaid expenses. They often include unpaid salaries and benefits earned by employees. Accrued taxes often include property and sales taxes that have been incurred but not yet paid. Other liabilities in this study are most often accounts payable-grains and oilseeds  delivered and sold to the cooperative by its patrons who have not yet been paid. Retired equity represents allocated equity that the board has approved to revolve to members but not yet paid as of the closing date of the books. This equity accu- mulated from past sales to or purchases from patrons-usually revolved to members on a set sched- ule (often 7 or more years later). Patronage refunds and dividends are monies declared but not yet paid to mem- bers for current use of the cooperative and for invest- ing in preferred stock. Cooperatives are required to pay at least 20 per- cent of their refunds in cash, with the rest becoming allocated equity to be revolved to the members at a later date. The refunds are based on cents per product (weight or bushel) sold and/or on a percent of the dol- lars of farm supplies purchased. The refunds are deter- mined by the board of directors. Dividends paid on preferred stock ownership are based on a set percent return on the investment. Current portion of Zong-term debt and seasonal short-term debt are the final current lia- bilities. They are money owed (principal) for borrow-ing money and for leases. Long-term debt typically is used to finance long-term assets, while short-term debt is usually used for operating or seasonal loans. Long-term debt- includes notes, bonds, mortgages, and leases not due within the current year. Member equities- are member and patron invest- ments in the cooperative. The two main types are allo- cated and unallocated. Allocated equity is assigned to members in one of two forms. Each member has one share and one vote. The other form includes noncash allocated certificates which are member investments in the cooperative based on use. Allocated equity could be classified as stock if the cooperative was incorporated or certificates of owner- ship if not incorporated. In most cases, cooperative stock or ownership certificates are not generally traded between members and, if sold, require board approval. Unallocated equity is the retained earnings of the cooper- ative and often thought of as nonmember-nonpatron- age business but can also be based on member business. Analysis of the Balance Sheet The balance sheet of a local cooperative states its financial position at the end of an operating period-a 1Zmonth  fiscal year. The balance sheet represents the cooperative’s assets, liabilities, member equity, and their relationship to each other. This report analyzes the balance sheets of 432 local cooperatives to provide examples of typical levels for assets, liabilities, and member equities for different sizes and types. Table 5 compares common size balance sheets for all respondents for 1995 and 1994. Appendix tables l-4 show common size balance sheets by size and type for 1995. In a common size balance sheet, each account is listed as a percentage of total assets. The dollar amount of total assets the balance sheets represent is listed at the bottom of the table. By cooperative size, total assets increased from $1.5 million for small coop- eratives to $16.2 million for super-size cooperatives (table 7). By cooperative type, total assets were $2.7 million for farm supply, $6.2 million for mixed farm supply, $7.8 million for mixed marketing, and $9 mil- lion for marketing (table 8). Current Assets Looking first at current assets, cash and cash equivalents as a percent of total assets decreased as cooperative size increased. For small cooperatives,cash was 7.4 percent of total assets. But, this dropped to From 1994 to 1995, current assets increased by 24 1.9 percent for super cooperatives. Farm supply cooper- percent.

By size, farm supply invento- ries increased about 10 percent more for large and super cooperatives and by type, about 5 percent more for both farm supply cooperatives. Grains and oilseeds inventories increased more than 55 percent for medi- um and super cooperatives. By type, they increased more than 50 percent for all but farm supply coopera- tives. There were also regional differences in inventory buildup. By looking at 103 cooperatives that had their grains and oilseeds  inventories increase more than 50 percent, 65 cooperatives were in Iowa, Minnesota, or Nebraska. In dollar terms, inventory increased $178 million, with $128 million in these three States. Part of this buildup was due to low grains and oilseeds  prices the prior year and farmers holding back sales. But a grain railcar  shortage in the upper Midwest also forced some cooperatives to resort to outdoor storage on the ground (with increased grain prices and especially corn prices, inventories of grains and oilseeds  can be expected to be much lower in FY 96). Interest expenses in the three States increased by $7 million, in part to finance these inventories. Local sav- ings fell $10 million and 30 cooperatives had losses in local income. Net income was up 16 percent for these cooperatives due to patronage refunds, so that only nine experienced losses. Accounts receivable in this study were farm sup- ply trade accounts, not grains and oilseeds  trade receivables. Farm supply and grains and oilseeds  trade receivables (“other” current assets) were separated to allow ratio analysis in a future section of this study. Accounts receivable for farm supply sales increased 7 percent, growing at about the same rate as the increase in farm supply sales. The age of accounts receivable refers to how long ago the sale that started this receivable was made. Most cooperatives have credit sales with discounts offered to promote prompt payment. Terms might be 2 percent-10 days, net 30 days (no discount). Discounts might be offered on all farm supply sales or on certain products. The terms and what products had discounts were not known, but 96 cooperatives listed their dis- count on sales, and it was 1.22 percent on total farm supply sales. The age of accounts receivable is known for 54 cooperatives for both years (table 6). Fifty-five percent were current. Another 14 percent were from 31 to 60 days old. The largest difference between the 2 years was nearly 12 percent of receivables were more than 6 months old compared with 8 percent in 1994.Table 6 Age of SCCOUM  receivable, 1995 and 1994 Accounts receivable age 1995 1994 Percent Current, 0 to 30 days 55.02 53.15 31 to 60 days 14.26 14.77 61 to 90 days 8.69 10.55 91 to 120 days 1.96 4.70 121 to 180 days 3.10 3.72 Greater than 6 months 11.63 7.70 Accounts written off this period 5.34 5.41 Based on accounts receivable of: $26,284,134  $24,160,885 Investments and Other Assets About 1.4 percent of cooperative’s total assets was invested in the Bank for Cooperatives or CoBank. Larger cooperatives and both types of marketing coop- eratives had comparable investments. Meanwhile, investments in other cooperatives dropped from a high of 26 percent for small cooperatives to 13 percent for super cooperatives. Across types, marketing coopera- tives had less invested than farm supply cooperatives. Other assets often included overdue accounts receiv- able and were generally less than 2 percent of total assets for all cooperative sizes and types (except large farm supply cooperatives, 4.2 percent). Property, Plant, and Equipment Net property, plant, and equipment (PP&E)  as a percent of total assets tended to be between 22 percent and 26 percent for all cooperative sizes. Net PP&E increased 6.5 percent from 1994. Cooperatives that handled grains and oilseeds  had higher dollar amounts of PP&E,  probably due to extensive grains and oilseeds  storage and handling facilities and, also, because these cooperatives were larger than farm sup- ply cooperatives. But, both farm supply cooperatives had growth in net W&E  of at least 9 percent while both marketing cooperatives were less than 5.5 per- cent. Current Liabilities Current liabilities grew 33 percent between 1994 and 1995. The largest increase was in notes payable- seasonal used to finance current operations, and usual- ly used for inventories, They grew from 11.2 percent of total assets to 16.5 percent. Farm supply cooperatives had a negligible change while mixed farm supply, mixed marketing, and marketing cooperatives all were up 5 percent.Table 7%Common  size balance sheets by cooperative size, 1995 Small Medium Large Super Assets Current assets Cash and cash equivalents Accounts receivable Inventories-grains and oilseeds -farm supplies Prepaid expenses Other current assets7.41 13.10 3.29 20.23 2.15 3.93Percent of fofal assets 4.59 3.03 14.05 11.96 11.38 18.46 14.11 12.68 64 63 5.07 6.541.93 9.07 31.21 9.15 .77 9.21 Total current assets Investments and other assets Investments-other cooperatives --Bank for Cooperatives50.11 50.04 53.50 61.34 26.20 22.51 17.95 12.72 .37 1.39 1.41 1.65 -total 26.57 23.90 19.36 14.37 Other assets 1.15 1.40 1.50 .53 Total investments & other assets Property, plant, and equipment At cost Less accumulated depreciation27.72 25.30 20.86 14.90 60.87 67.77 71.20 60.07 38.70 43.11 45.57 36.30 Net PP&E 22.17 24.66 25.64 23.76 Total assets 100.00 100.00 100.00 100.00 Liabilities and owner equities Current liabilities Current portion of long-term debt Notes payable-seasonal Accounts payable Patrons credii balances & other liabilities Accrued taxes Accrued expenses Patronage refunds (cash) Total current liabilities Long-term debt Total liabilities 27.86 37.73 47.11 58.76 Owner equities Allocated equity Unallocated equity1.76 3.05 4.11 3.12 6.35 9.29 13.09 22.19 6.38 5.88 6.09 4.35 6.19 9.13 12.94 18.74 .44 .55 .65 .71 1.30 1.42 1.65 1.52 1.31 1.38 1.31 1.10 23.73 30.70 39.84 51.73 4.13 7.03 7.27 7.03 53.64 45.70 39.58 30.02 18.50 16.57 13.31 11.22 Total owner equities 72.14 62.27 52.89 41.24 Total liabilities and owner equities Based on total assets of:100.00 100.00 100.00 100.00 $1,460,910 $3,558,985 $8,316,485 $16,249,985 7Table s-Common  Size balance sheets by cooperative type, 1995 Farm supply Mixed farm supply Mixed marketing Marketing Assets Current assets Cash and cash equivalents Accounts receivable Inventories-grains and oifseeds -farm supplies Prepaid expenses Other current assets Total current assetsPercent of total assets 5.34 2.78 2.66 2.30 13.59 15.15 10.41 7.09 0.00 16.32 27.53 35.66 23.11 12.33 9.79 6.16 2.05 .65 .68 .57 2.69 3.85 8.64 11.51 46.78 51.08 59.71 63.29 Investments and other assets Investments-other cooperatives -Bank for Cooperatives25.47 19.77 14.66 11.30 .72 1.39 1.67 1.69 -total 26.19 21.16 16.33 12.99 Other assets 2.12 1.31 .36 .63 Total investments & other assets Property, plant, and equipment At cost Less accumulated depreciation Net PP&E28.31 22.47 16.69 13.62 58.84 68.75 69.64 58.78 33.93 42.30 46.04 35.69 24.91 26.45 23.60 23.09 Total assets 100.00 100.00 100.00 100.00 Liabilities and owner equities Current liabilities Current portion of long-term debt Notes payable-seasonal Accounts payable Patrons credit balances & other liabilities Accrued taxes Accrued expenses Patronage refunds (cash)2.00 3.14 3.36 4.00 6.79 15.67 18.91 20.90 7.66 6.34 4.35 3.78 5.27 7.06 16.47 23.78 .51 .55 .76 .67 1.86 1.88 1.54 1.03 1.62 1.51 1.23 0.74 Total current liabilities Long-term debt Total liabilities Owner equities Allocated equity Unallocated equity Total owner equities Total liabilities and owner equities Based on assets of:25.71 36.15 46.62 54.90 7.42 7.81 5.97 6.77 33.13 43.96 52.59 61.67 52.05 45.05 32.67 26.52 14.82 10.99 14.74 11.81 66.87 56.04 47.41 38.33 100.00 100.00 100.00 100.00 $2,731,412 $6,180,969 $7,762,383 $9,046,959 8Patrons’ credit balances and other liabilities grew by 32 percent, mostly due to the inclusion of payables due on grains and oilseeds  trading and other market- ing activities. Accrued expenses and patronage refunds were the only other current liabilities that grew in double digits. Accrued expenses grew by 17.7 percent and were a slightly larger percentage of total assets for larger cooperatives and for both types of farm supply cooperatives. Cash patronage refunds and dividends grew by 15.5 percent, but was less than 2 percent of total assets for all sizes and types of cooperatives. Long-term Debt Long-term debt increased by 16.3 percent from 1994 to 1995. As a percent of total assets it generally increased with cooperative size, but interestingly, tended to be higher for both types of farm supply cooperatives. By type as a percent of total assets, long- term debt ranged from 6 percent to 7.8 percent with the farm supply cooperatives at the high end, about a percentage point higher than the marketing coopera- tives. Twenty-nine percent of the cooperatives had no long-term debt. About half were small farm supply cooperatives and combined together, farm supply cooperatives made up more than half. Nearly 66 percent of the cooperatives provided information that broke out four main sources of their $500 million total debt (short- and long-term com- bined)-Bank  for Cooperatives and CoBank,  commer- cial banks, debentures or notes, and other. A regional cooperative was most often the source in the “other” category. The local cooperative often purchases its farm supplies and markets its grains and oilseeds  through a regional cooperative, which becomes a source of debt capital. The debt may be short-term operating capital or long-term investment capital. Bank for Cooperatives and CoBank were the most frequent source of debt capital (59 percent). Others were regional cooperatives (32 percent), deben- tures or notes (5 percent), and commercial banks (4 percent). Most sources, except debentures and notes, extend lines of credit. Only 90 cooperatives reported their lines of credit for both years, but in total it increased by $20 million to $308 million in 1995. Of this line of credit, the unused portion fell by $20 mil- lion to $166 million in 1995. Member Equities Member equities to total assets represent the per- cent of the cooperative’s assets owned by the mem-bers, with creditors claiming the rest. Over all sizes and types of cooperatives, members averaged 50.3 per- cent ownership of the cooperative, down from 55.7 percent in 1994. Members of small cooperatives had the highest percentage of ownership (72.1 percent) while members of super-size cooperatives had the lowest (41.2 per- cent). By cooperative type, members of mixed farm supply cooperatives owned at least 56 percent of their cooperatives’ assets while farm supply cooperatives’ members owned more than 66 percent. Both types of marketing cooperatives had lower member owner- ship-38.3 percent for marketing and 47.4 percent for mixed marketing cooperatives. Member equities consisted of both allocated (pre- ferred, common, and other kinds of ownership certifi- cates) and unallocated equity. Allocated equity as a percentage of total assets was highest for small cooper- atives at 53.6 percent and more than 45 percent for both farm supply cooperatives. Unallocated equity averaged more than 13 per- cent of total assets for all sizes and types, but fell as cooperative size increased. By type, unallocated equity was around 15 percent of total assets for farm supply and mixed marketing cooperatives and around 11 per- cent to 12 percent for mixed farm supply and market- ing cooperatives. Description of Income Statement The income statement shows the results of opera- tions for the past year and usually includes both the current and prior year. It lists all sources of revenue and expenses. The statement measures the profitability of the cooperative for a given period of time. Although it does not show timing of cash-flows, the statement best describes the status of the business. In the analysis of income statements, net sales were set at 100 percent to find out the proportion that a single item represented in a total group or subgroup. Because the income statement variables were expressed as a percent of net sales, comparisons were possible between different sizes and types of opera- tions. Thus, the statement used in this report became known as a “common size” income statement. This statement was provided for the average cooperative respondent in table 9. The first item listed on the income statement net sales was the primary source of revenue-farm supplies sold and products marketed. Cost of goods sold (COGS) was the amount a cooperative paid for the products it sold and market- 9Table 9-hICOI?W  Statt?t?Wnt  and change in SCCOUntS,  19%  t0 1995 1995 1994 Percent change Net sales Cost of goods sold Gross margin Service and other income Gross revenue Operating expenses Employee: Salaries and wages Payroll taxes Employee insurance Pension expense Total Administrative: Professional services Office supplies (includes postage) Telephone, markets Meetings and travel Donations Dues and subscriptions Directors’ fees and expense Annual meetings expense Total General: Advertising and promotion Delivery (auto & truck) expense Insurance Property & Business taxes Other taxes and licenses Rent and lease expense Plant supplies & repairs Repairs and maintenance Utilities (includes dryer expense) Miscellaneous expenses Other expenses Total Depreciation Interest expense Bad debts Total expenses Local savings Patronage refunds received Savings before income taxes Less income taxes Net income Based on sales of:100.00 90.06 9.94 3.98 13.92Percent of net sales 100.00 89.87 10.13 3.79 13.927.82 8.05 5.83 13.26 7.85 4.69 4.36 15.97 .37 .36 9.31 .49 .50 6.78 .14 .14 12.94 5.69 5.36 7.16 .16 .13 34.45 .16 .16 7.72 .09 .09 7.18 .07 .07 7.52 .Ol .Ol 9.92 .03 .03 15.51 .03 .03 6.26 .02 .02 3.93 57 .54 13.66 .16 .16 8.81 .68 .63 16.27 .49 .51 2.83 .33 .34 3.55 .15 .17 (4.96) .20 .20 9.28 .22 .20 21.74 .68 .65 12.85 .49 .51 3.08 .12 .ll 17.21 .32 .39 (14.35) 3.84 3.87 18.00 1.53 1.54 7.33 .89 .68 42.42 .ll .lO 17.16 12.63 12.09 12.65 1.29 1.83 (23.98) 1.41 1.11 36.55 2.70 2.94 (1.03) .31 .68 (51 .Ol) 2.39 2.26 14.01 $12,187,025 $11,302,965 10ed-cost to the cooperative for the supplies sold and payments to farmers for products marketed. Net sales less COGS represented the gross margin on sales. Service and other income came mainly from pro- viding services to cooperative patrons. Service includ- ed delivery, chemical and fertilizer application, grain drying, and storage. Although substantial for some cooperatives, service income was not considered a pri- mary source of revenue. Operating expenses were those incurred in the course of conducting normal business. They were usu- ally classified by function like employee, administra- tive, general, and depreciation, interest, and bad debts. Local savings resulted from operations before taxes and patronage refunds from other cooperatives. Patronage refunds were based on volume of business conducted with another cooperative and were depen- dent on the other cooperative’s net income. Usually, this income was allocated equity and not actual cash coming into the respondent cooperatives. Net income was the end result of operations for that year. Distribution of net income was not part of the income statement. The board of directors decides how to distribute net income or allocate a net loss. Analysis of the Income Statement The income statement displays the net results of cooperative operations. Because most managers’ per- formance is judged by net income, members attach great importance to the income statement. In the fol- lowing sections, the underling values of the income statement are studied. Table 9 presents a common size income statement for 432 cooperatives and the change between 1994 and 1995. Appendix tables 5 to 8 show common size income statements by size and type for 1995. Net Sales The first item of the income statement analyzed in this report was net sales. It was determined by sub- tracting sales discounts and returns and allowances from gross sales. The average net sales for the 432 cooperatives in 1995 was $12.2 million, up $0.9 million or 7.8 percent from 1994. Net sales by cooperative size are presented in table 10, and by type in table 11. All sizes and types of cooperatives experienced a growth in net sales from 1994. If assets from tables 7 and 8 are compared to net sales in tables 10 and 11, sales for all types (except marketing) and sizes are about twice the level of assets.Cost of Goods Sold Cost of goods sold (COGS) represented the largest single component of expenses, usually expressed as a percent of net sales. For this study, COGS includes the beginning inventory plus purchas- es and freight costs, minus purchase returns and allowances, purchase discounts, and ending inventory. So, for these cooperatives, COGS was the purchase price of the farm supplies sold or products marketed. Table 11 shows COGS as a percent of net sales for the different types of cooperatives. Both types of market- ing cooperatives had a relatively high COGS when compared with farm supply cooperatives, which was to be expected because they were generally marketing grains and oilseeds  for their patrons with only a few cents per bushel margin. There was negligible change in COGS by cooperative size and type between the 2 years. Gross Margins Gross margins were the excess of net sales over the cost of goods sold. The gross margin averaged 9.9 percent for all cooperatives, down from 10.1 percent in 1994. The gross margin or gross margin percentage is a very important operating ratio. A small change in the gross margin has a tremendous impact on local sav- ings. A cooperative manager must maintain a gross margin near industry averages. Thus, least cost sources of supplies need to be developed and marketing coop- eratives must pay market rates on the products they purchase. Cooperatives are often characterized as business- es that provide goods and services “at cost.” However, a cooperative cannot operate at cost on a day-to-day basis. Therefore, unless a cooperative has an adequate gross margin, it can neither be profitable nor afford to finance essential future-directed discretionary expen- ditures such as expansion and advertising. Because by definition, gross margin equals net sales less cost of goods sold, those cooperatives with higher COGS had lower gross margins. COGS were higher for marketing and larger cooperatives, so gross margins as a percent of net sales were highest for farm supply and small cooperatives. Farm supply coopera- tives-16.7 percent-had the highest gross margin. Although both types of farm supply cooperatives had less business volume than those that performed mar- keting activities, their gross margin percentage was from 6 to 10 percentage points higher. Small coopera- tives, mostly selling farm supplies, had the highest gross margin by size (15.6 percent). 11Table w-Abbreviated income statement as a percent of net sales for cooperatives by size, 1995 Small Medium Large Super Percent of net sa/es Net sales 100.00 100.00 100.00 100.00 Cost of goods sold 64.36 67.66 89.08 91.98 Gross margin 15.64 12.34 10.92 a.02 Service and other income 3.63 4.16 4.07 3.94 Gross revenue 19.27 16.50 14.99 11.96 Expenses Employee 1 9.23 7.22 6.52 4.58 Administrative * 1.10 .79 .59 -44 General 3 4.35 3.78 3.56 3.35 Depreciation 2.11 1.97 1.74 1.46 Interest .68 .a2 .90 1.03 Bad debts .23 .24 .ia .06 Totalexpenses 17.70 14.82 13.49 10.92 Local savings 1.57 1.68 1.50 1.04 Patronage refunds received 2.36 1 .a4 1.49 1.12 Savings before income taxes 3.93 3.52 2.99 2.16 Less income taxes .24 .42 .49 .20 Net income 3.69 3.10 2.50 1.96 Based on total sales of: $2,599,834 $7,010,685 $13,819,360 !§37,104,303 t Employee expenses include salaries and wages, payroll taxes, employee insurance, unemployment compensation, and pension expense. 2 Administrative costs include professional services, office supplies, telephone, meetings and travel, donations, dues and subscriptions, directors’ fees and expense, and annual meetings. 3 General expenses include advertising and promotion, delivery (auto and truck), insurance, property, business and other taxes and licenses, rent and lease expenses, plant supplies and repairs, repairs and maintenance, utilities, miscellaneous, and other. Gross margins vary not only by cooperative, but also by farm supply sold or product marketed. Cooperatives, like other businesses, have different margins for different products. For 100 cooperatives that provided their individual product gross margins, these margins are shown in table 12. Margins vary due to product type and competition. For instance, fertiliz- er sold by the truckload has a different margin than a sale of a single bag. The services offered in conjunction with a sale (e.g., fertilizer spread on the field by a cooperative truck) have an impact on margin. Margins are also subject to competition. The gross margin dis- cussed in the first paragraph of this section is a blend- 12ed margin, made up of the margins of all products the cooperative sold, services rendered, and products mar- keted. The highest weighted (by volume) gross margin for the five main farm supplies was for fertilizer with a gross margin of almost 19 percent. The maximum mar- gin on fertilizer of 46 percent was for a small amount, probably a speciality fertilizer sold by the bag. Feed and petroleum margins were both around 17 percent. The margin of -302 percent on seed looks incorrect and needs further explanation. This margin was from a cooperative with more than $6 million in grains and oilseeds  sales that sold $1,500 of seed for $400.

For example, the two cooperatives with the lowest margins were located in close proximity and of course, in head-to-head competition. On further analysis, both cooperatives have been profitable over the past 5 years and have increased sales. They have even discussed merger, but membership has resisted this change. In this one instance, their low margins may be equated to low product prices-something that their members have noted by increasing their purchases from both cooperatives.Grains and oilseeds  were the only products mar- keted where gross margins were known. Grains and oilseeds  margins were low, only around 4 percent. Around 10 cooperatives reported high grains and oilseeds  margins of 18 and 19 percent. These high mar- gins were all at mixed farm supply cooperatives that had feed sales. It is suspected that the high margins resulted from the grain and oilseed  content in livestock feeds sold rather than the commodities themselves. Service and Other Income Service and other income, for the most part, con- sisted of trucking services (both delivery of purchases to patrons and transfer of their products to market), custom application of fertilizers and crop protectants, and drying and storing of grains and oilseeds.

This income averaged between 3.6 percent and 5 percent of net sales for all sizes and types of cooperatives. Other income was derived from non-operating sources such as interest and finance charges. This income included interest on cash equivalents and interest charged on credit sales. Other income also came from the sale of property, plant, and equipment, rentals, and extraordinary items. Sometimes property, plant, and equipment was sold to generate income, but usually it was the sale of a fully depreciated asset where the market value was greater than the book value. In some cases, disposal of a fully depreciated asset may mean a loss to the coop- erative. Rental income from unused facilities or equip- ment provided income flows. Extraordinary items might be either a gain or a loss. A gain could result from a fire loss where the insurance settlement was greater than the book value of the asset. A loss might be from flood damage for which the cooperative had no coverage. Operating Expenses Operating expenses were divided into four main categories-employee; administrative; general; and depreciation, interest, and bad debts. Employee expenses, of course, were related to labor costs. Administrative expenses included a variety of over- head costs associated with a cooperative and indirectly related to revenue production. General expenses were those directly related to revenue production, The bulk were in employee, general, and depreciation categories. 14Employee Expenses Employee expenses included salaries, wages, and benefits (payroll taxes, employee insurance, unem- ployment compensation, and pension expense) and averaged 5.7 percent of net sales for all respondent cooperatives. Employee expenses, up 7.2 percent from 1994, represented the smallest increase of all the major expense categories. As a percent of net sales, employee expenses decreased as cooperative size increased. This expense decreased from 9.2 percent of net sales for small coop- eratives to 4.6 percent for super cooperatives. By type, employee expenses as a percent of net sales were 9.6 percent for farm supply cooperatives and 3.4 percent for marketing cooperatives. About 62 percent of the cooperatives (268) pro- vided employee numbers and expenses (table 13). These expenses were for all employees. To equate part- time to full-time employees for purposes of this study, four part-time employees were considered as one full- time equivalent employee.3 Based on that calculation, the expense for a single employee averaged $30,119 for an average 19 employees, up 4 percent from 1994. By size, they ranged from $26,982 for small to $33,010 for super cooperatives and by type from $27,611 for those selling only farm supplies to $33,481 for mixed market- ing cooperatives. Small cooperatives averaged 8 actual full-time employees (excludes part-time), medium, 16; 3 Based on previous research conducted by CS economist David E.

Farm supply cooperatives averaged 14 employees, mixed farm supply, 28; mixed marketing, 25; and marketing, 19. Cooperatives with a significant proportion of their sales as farm supplies tended to be more labor intensive. Operating a feed mill or service station, applying chemicals and fertilizers, and selling hard- ware required the use of several employees. For instance, a small farm supply cooperative had 9 full- time employees while a small marketing cooperative used fewer employees-often only a manager, book- keeper, and two others. Administrative Expenses Administrative expenses were indirectly related to generating income. Managers usually had more con- trol over administrative expenses than any other cost. In years when revenues were down, managers could reduce expenses in this area more easily than in other categories. Administrative costs include professional services, donations, dues and subscriptions, directors’ fees and expenses, annual meetings, meetings and travel, office supplies, and telephone and market infor- mation.Professional services (such as legal, accounting, and computer) and office supplies both comprised 0.16 percent of net sales-the largest administrative expense. In total, administrative expenses were less than 0.6 percent of net sales. These expenses fell from a high of 1.1 percent for small cooperatives to 0.44 per- cent for super cooperatives. As cooperative size increased, the highest administrative expense, profes- sional services, fell as the cooperative relied more on its own employees to perform these tasks rather than purchase the services. Although directors’ fees and expenses were a small part of total costs, director compensation was important to many cooperatives to get farmers to sacri- fice time normally spent on their own operations to devote several hours of service each month to guiding their cooperative. Table 14 shows the number of direc- tors and their compensation for 282 cooperatives in 1995. Board expenses seemed rather modest, averaging $684  per director. The average board had seven direc- tors. By size, small cooperatives paid directors the least ($364) and super paid the most ($1,306). By type, mixed farm supply cooperatives paid the most at $1,087 per director. 15General Expenses General expenses were usually fixed in the short run and associated with income production. These expenses included advertising and promotion, deliv- ery (auto and truck), general insurance, property, busi- ness and other taxes and licenses, rent and lease expenses, plant supplies and repairs, repairs and main- tenance, utilities (including dryer expenses), miscella- neous, and other. Most of these expenses (with the exception of advertising and promotion) were not under direct management control. General expenses averaged 3.8 percent of net sales in 1995, Repairs and maintenance and delivery expenses at 0.68 percent of net sales were the largest in the general category, followed by insurance and utili- ties, both at 0.49. By cooperative size, general expenses were 4.4 for small cooperatives and 3.4 for super coop- eratives. By cooperative type, these expenses were around 5 percent of net sales for farm supply coopera- tives and around 3 for marketing cooperatives. Depreciation, Interest, and Bad Debts Depreciation expense averaged 1.5 percent of net sales; interest, 0.9 percent; and bad debts, 0.1 percent. By cooperative size, depreciation expense as a percent of net sales was 2.1 percent for small cooperatives and 1.5 percent for super cooperatives. By cooperative type, depreciation expense was 2.2 percent of net sales for farm supply cooperatives, 1.5 percent for mixed marketing, and 1.2 percent for marketing cooperatives. As discussed earlier, interest expenses, especially for short-term borrowing increased dramatically, going from 0.7 percent of net sales in 1994 to 0.9 percent in 1995. Interest expenses were lowest among small coop- eratives at 0.7, but grew to more than 1 percent for super cooperatives. By type, interest expenses were about 0.9 percent for all cooperatives except mixed farm supply which was highest at 1.1 percent.Bad debts as a percent of net sales fell as coopera- tive size increased-O.2 for small cooperatives and 0.1 for super cooperatives. By cooperative type, bad debts were 0.2 for both farm supply cooperatives and around 0.1 for both marketing cooperatives. Local Savings Local savings or local income was generated from own operations (before taxes and patronage refunds from other cooperatives). Local savings as a percent of net sales was highest for small cooperatives (1.6 per- cent) and lowest for super cooperatives (1 percent). By type, local savings was the highest for farm supply cooperatives (1.9 percent) and the lowest for market- ing cooperatives (0.8 percent). Small cooperatives, and especially farm supply cooperatives, had higher local savings than larger marketing cooperatives. About 24 percent of the cooperatives in this study had losses. While small cooperatives have higher returns on net sales, 50 or one-third of them lost money. Table 15 shows losses by size and type. Thirty percent of the mixed farm supply cooperatives lost money. Most likely to lose money were small mixed farm supply cooperatives (57 percent). Patronage Refunds Received Patronage refunds received or income from other cooperatives resulted from locals doing business with other cooperatives, generally regionals, or cooperative banks such as CoBank or the Bank for Cooperatives. The patronage refund from regionals was based on business volume and consisted of cash refunds and equity stock. The equity stock was usually revolved back to the local cooperative on a set schedule. Many respondent cooperatives also borrowed funds from CoBank and the Bank for Cooperatives and received both cash and noncash  patronage income.

Patronage refunds reflect the volume of business with regional cooperatives, CoBank or the Bank for Cooperatives. The dollar amount of patronage refunds between 1994 and 1995 was up 37 percent, suggesting 1995 must have been a good year for regional coopera- tives, CoBank, or the Bank for Cooperatives. Patronage refunds received were 2.4 percent of net sales for small cooperatives and 1.1 percent for super cooperatives. By cooperative type, patronage refunds received as a per- cent of net sales were higher for farm supply coopera- tives than for marketing cooperatives. Patronage refunds were an important source of revenues. They allowed 71 (out of 102) cooperatives that had local losses to have net income. Income Taxes Cooperatives paid income taxes on earnings not allocated to members (retained earnings) and on divi- dend payments. The decision as to what amounts of income that were allocated to retained earnings and to members was made by the board of directors. The treatment of nonmember business has an impact on retained earnings because the cooperative could allo- cate the earnings to nonmembers or retain the income. In terms of net sales, income tax paid was 0.3 percent of net sales in 1995. Income tax paid by cooperatives varied by size and type. Small cooperatives paid income taxes equal to 0.2 percent of their net sales, medium, 0.4; large, 0.5; and super, 0.2. All cooperatives except mixed market- ing ( 0.5 percent) paid 0.2 percent of their net sales in income taxes. Net Income Net income is the term used here for profits on cooperative income statements.

For small cooperatives it was 3.7 percent of net sales, medium, 3.1 percent; large, 2.5 percent; and super, 2 percent. By cooperative type, farm supply had returns of 4.1 percent on net sales, mixed farm supply had 3.2 percent, mixed marketing cooperatives, 2.1 percent, and marketing cooperatives, 1.5 percent. Net income (before taxes) was generally distrib- uted five ways-non-cash patronage allocations, cash patronage refunds, retained earnings, income taxes, and dividends on patron’s equity (table 16). Nearly 53 percent of net income before taxes was held as non- cash patronage allocations by the 287 cooperatives that provided income allocations. Cash patronage refunds were 22 percent. All distributions of income were basi- cally unchanged from 1994. Only 9 of the 287 coopera- tives reported dividends on preferred stock. The effec- tive interest paid was 3.22 percent. Financial Ratio Analvsis Looking beyond levels of assets, liabilities, mem- ber equities, sales, and expenses, cooperative man- agers and boards of directors need comparative mea- sures to evaluate their cooperative’s financial performance. Standard ratios were used in this report, includ- ing financial ratio analysis that allow performance comparisons between years and different cooperatives. No single financial indicator will provide enough information to determine a cooperative’s financial health. Therefore, ratios must be carefully interpreted. It is important to look at a group of financial ratios over a period of time, evaluate other cooperatives with similar sales and functions, and/or compare perfor- mance with other cooperatives in the same geographi- cal area. Ratios used in this study were often chosen because of their comparability with prior studies. Therefore, most figures show ratios for the 11-year period for all 1,610 cooperatives. Data for 1994 and 1995 reflect information gathered from the same 432 cooperatives that reported for both years. Performance ratios measure various levels of cooperative operations and generally have both a financial and operational impact. Four categories were used-liquidity, leverage, activity, and profitability. Many factors underlie each ratio and examining one ratio may not help pinpoint problems. Net income before taxes: Number of cooperatives:$101,171,588  $94,112,032 287 330 17Liquidity Ratios Liquidity ratios, such as current and quick, mea- sure the cooperative’s ability to meet short-term oblig- ations. They focus on the cooperative’s ability to remain solvent. The current ratio is current assets divided by current liabilities. However, this ratio does not consider the degree of liquidity of each of the com- ponents of current assets. In other words, if the current assets of a cooperative were mainly cash, they would be much more liquid than if comprised of mainly inventory. If the ratio is less than 1, current liabilities exceed current assets and the cooperative’s liquidity is threat- Figure i-Current and Quick Ratios Ratio 21 4-=-Quick 0 ’IIIIIIIII 1985 868788899092939495ened.  Improvements in this ratio can be achieved by selling additional capital stock, borrowing additional long-term debt, or disposing of unproductive fixed assets and retaining proceeds. Current liabilities may also be reduced by retaining a greater portion of allo- cated savings (reducing the cash portion). A high current ratio is a favorable condition financially because it indicates the ability to pay cur- rent liabilities from the conversion of current assets into cash. Operationally, this same high ratio tends to increase operating freedom and reduce the probability of bill-paying difficulty from writedowns of accounts receivable or inventory. Figure 1 shows the current and quick ratios for the surveyed cooperatives. The current ratio was relatively constant for 3 years before it took a slight downturn in 1995. The total current assets increased 24 percent while total current liabilities increased 33 percent. From 1994 to 1995, grains and oilseeds  and farm sup- ply inventories and dividends on equity were the only elements of current liabilities that grew. Higher grain and oilseed  inventories are probably causing the 32- percent increase in patron credit balances and other liabilities (which contains grain trade payables). The current ratio fell as cooperative size increased. The ratio was highest for small cooperatives (2.11) and fell to 1.19 for super cooperatives (table 17). By cooper- ative type, the ratio was 1.15 for marketing coopera- tives and 1.82 for farm supply cooperatives (table 18). Quick ratio is current assets minus inventories, divided by current liabilities. Inventories are exclud- ed-the least liquid of all current assets. All elements of this ratio have increased.

Operationally, the results are the same as with current ratio. The quick ratio mimicked the movement of the current ratio. Small cooperatives (1.12) had the highest ratio and it decreased as size increased to 0.41 for super cooperatives (table 17). The quick ratio ranged from a low of 0.39 for marketing cooperatives to a high of 0.92 for farm supply cooperatives. This ratio was highest in 1986 and lowest in 1995 (figure 1).

They help to analyze the use of debt and the ability to meet obligations in times of crisis. Debt-to-asset ratio is defined as total debt divided by total assets. Elements of this ratio include long-term debt plus short-term debt and total assets. Long-term debt increased at the same rate as total assets, which may indicate some short-term obligations were being carried and converted to long-term debt. With invento- ries increasing in the short term, quick financing is needed, usually through the use of short-term debt. In fact, short-term debt increased 72 percent between 1994 and 1995 (table 5). Lenders would rather see a low ratio indicating the cooperative’s ability to repay the loan. Overall, this ratio increased from .21 to .27 because assets increased by 17 percent while debt increased by almost one-half (figure 2). Reducing debt, increasing savings, or financing a greater portion of assets with working capital may improve this ratio. Larger cooperatives were financing more of their assets with debt, but the highest ratio for any size or type of cooperative was still only 0.32 (table 17). Small cooperatives had the lowest use of debt at 0.12. Debt usage was highest for marketing cooperatives at 0.32. This was twice the ratio for farm supply cooperatives. By type, farm supply cooperatives had the lowest use of debt. Debt-to-equity ratio is calculated by dividing long- term debt by member equity. This ratio shows the financial flexibility and the long-term capital structure of the cooperative. High ratios indicate inadequate borrowing power of the cooperative.

A low ratio is more favorable and finan- cially impacts the cooperative through independence on outside sources of funds relative to owners’ equity. A low ratio may also have an unfavorable impact indi- cating low return on equity. Operationally, a low ratio tends to reduce interest cost. Improvement may be gained by reducing long-term debt by disposing of unproductive assets and using proceeds to liquidate debt, or accelerating payments on long-term loans. Other ways include increasing local equity by generat- ing higher levels of local savings, slowing down equity retirement programs, selling additional capital stock, or retaining a greater portion of allocated savings. As cooperative size grew, so did their use of long- term debt. The ratio for small cooperatives was 0.06 Table w-Financial analysis ratios for all cooperatives, 1995and1994 Ratio 1995 1994 Current 1.32 1.41 Quick 0.52 0.65 Debts-to-assets 0.27 0.21 Debt-to-equity 0.14 0.12 Times-interest-earned 3.65 4.65 Total-asset-turnover 2.16 2.34 Fixed-asset-turnover 6.93 8.83 Gross profit margin 9.94 10.13 Return on total assets before interest &taxes 8.04 8.66 Return on allocated equity 13.96 12.65 Figure %--Debt-To-Equity Ratio Percent 0.35 0.30 0.25 1985 86 67 88 89 90 92 93 94 95 20and 0.17 for super cooperatives (table 17). Marketing cooperatives had, at 0.18, the highest ratio by type, while farm supply cooperatives were the lowest at 0.11. When looking at the trend, the ratio increased slightly each year from 1992 to 1995, but is much lower than prior years (figure 3). Times-interest-earned ratio  is the number of times interest expense is covered by earnings. It is calculated by dividing earnings before interest and taxes by inter- est expense. A ratio of one or more indicates the ability of current earnings to pay current interest expenses. Lending institutions are more apt to loan to coopera- tives whose times-interest-earned ratio is more than one (1) because it shows their ability to pay interest payments. Subsequently, a lending institution may lend funds at lower rates more readily for capital improvements. Times-interest-earned ratio was higher for respondent cooperatives in 1993 before starting a slight downward trend for the next 2 years (figure 4). This ratio may be improved by collecting old receiv- ables, improving inventory turnover, disposing of assets and reducing debt with proceeds, or reducing debt with working capital. Financially, a high ratio impacts the return on equity and tends to increase it. Over time operationally, a high ratio will reduce inter- est cost. Interest coverage was the greatest for smaller cooperatives and generally fell as cooperative size increased to super cooperatives (table 17). By coopera- tive type, the ratio ranged from 2.81 for marketing to 6.04 for farm supply. Figure 4-Times-interest-Earned  Ratio Ratio ” 1985 86 87 88 89 90 92 93 94 95Activity Ratios Activity ratios measure how well cooperatives use assets. A low ratio could mean that the cooperative was overcapitalized or carrying too much inventory. A high ratio could be deceptive. A cooperative with fully depreciated older assets could have an artificially high ratio even though those assets were no longer operat- ing efficiently. Total-asset-turnover ratio was found by dividing net sales by total cooperative assets. This ratio has gone down slightly from 2.34 in 1994 to 2.16 in 1995 (figure 5). Both elements of this ratio increased-total sales by 8 percent and total assets by 17 percent. A high ratio exerts a favorable financial influence through the reduction of financial leverage and/or increased return on equity. A high ratio operationally tends to reduce interest costs. The ratio was higher for larger cooperatives (table 17). Super cooperatives had the highest ratio at 2.28, indicating the most efficient use of assets. By cooperative type, the total asset turnover ratio was higher for marketing than farm supply. The total asset turnover ratio was lowest in 1995 at 2.16 and highest in 1989 at 3.01. Fixed-asset-turnover ratio represents net sales divided by net property, plant, and equipment (PP&E). This ratio is similar to the total asset turnover ratio and shows how well the cooperative is using its fixed assets. This ratio by itself might not give a complete picture of the cooperative’s financial health. A cooper- ative with fully depreciated assets would have an arti- Figure ti--Total-  and Fixed-Asset-Turnover Ra tie 12 1 10 “I6 Total-asset-turnover 4 2-0’ ’I I 1 I I I I I I 1985a6a788a99092939495ficially  high ratio. A cooperative that invested heavily in PP&E  for future expansion will have a temporarily low ratio. After a high in 1989 of 10.20, this ratio has remained relatively level for the 1990s. In 1995, the ratio was 8.93 and increased slightly from 1994 because sales increased 8 percent while investment in fixed assets increased 7 percent. The measure for this ratio may or may not show favorable or unfavorable conditions. It simply reflects cooperative conditions. An abnormally high ratio usually indicates very old, nearly depreciated fixed assets or the leasing of prop- erty and equipment. A high ratio financially exerts a favorable influ- ence by increasing asset use, reducing financial lever- age, and/or increasing return on equity. A high ratio, operationally, tends to reduce depreciation and interest costs. It may also increase costs related to operating leases, personnel and travel or delivery expenses. This ratio may be improved by restricting further invest- ments in fixed assets; redesigning production, or office facilities to increase the sales generating potential of existing space and equipment; and/or selling idle machinery and parts, unused vehicles, and unneces- sary equipment. By size, a fixed-asset-turnover ratio of 9.61 was greatest for super cooperatives. By type, the ratio was the highest (10.49) for marketing cooperatives. The fixed-asset-turnover ratio was at its lowest in 1987 (fig- ure 51. Profitability Ratios Profitability ratios, such as gross profit margin, indicate the efficiency of the cooperative’s operations. Because a cooperative is owned by its user-members, many common industry profitability ratios have little meaning. For instance, profitability ratios measuring the return on common or preferred stock of similar investor-oriented firms are not appropriate because there is seldom an open market for cooperative stock. Gross profit margin is found by subtracting the cost of goods sold from, net sales and then dividing this amount (gross margin) by net sales. The gross profit margin is an important operating ratio. A small change in the gross margin has a tremendous impact on local savings. It indicates the cooperative’s pricing policy and cost of goods offered for sale. For all cooperatives, the gross profit margin aver- aged 9.94 percent in 1995. The gross profit margin was the highest for respondent cooperatives in 1993 at 10.76 percent (figure 6). By size, gross profit margin diminished as cooperative sales grew. At 15.64 percent, 21small cooperatives had the highest gross margin. By type, farm supply and mixed farm supply coopera- tives, at 16.68 percent and 14.94 percent, had the high- est margins in 1995 (table 18). Return on total assets measures the rate of return on total investment. It is calculated by dividing net income by total assets and usually calculated before interest and taxes. This ratio is a measure of perfor- mance. It is not sensitive to the leverage position of the cooperative. Although some assets were financed through debt, the ratio measures return to both mem- bers and lenders. This ratio declined by 0.62 percent to 8.04 percent between 1994 and 1995 (table 19). Net savings (before income taxes) declined 1 per- cent while interest expense increased 42 percent dur- ing the 2-year period (table 9). For the decade, this ratio was highest in 1992 and 1995 and has been fairly constant (figure 7). Operationally, a high ratio tends to reduce interest cost and financially indicates a compar- atively high rate of return on assets employed. Medium and large cooperatives had a higher return on total assets (table 17). Medium-sized cooper- atives were slightly higher at 8.54 percent. By coopera- tive type, return on total assets was highest for farm supply cooperatives at 9.27 percent. Assets relative to revenue were higher for both types of farm supply cooperatives. Return on allocated equity is net income divided by allocated equity. It was determined by subtracting unallocated equity from total member equities. It rep- resents member investment in their cooperative and is an important measure of profitability. Figure 6- Gross Profit Margin Percent ‘*tiThis ratio increased 1 percent in 1995 (table 19). This ratio is sensitive to the amount of debt capital in the cooperative and best used in conjunction with other measures such as the return on total assets. Net savings increased 14 percent while allocated equity increased 3 percent from 1994 to 1995. Financially, a high ratio is favorable and tends to decrease financial leverage. However, a high ratio may also be a symptom of low investment adequacy. Operationally, a high ratio tends to reduce interest cost over time but may occur when both total debt and interest costs are on the high side. By size, this ratio increased as the cooperative grew in size. Super cooperatives had the highest return on allocated equity (14.92 percent). Farm supply and mixed farm supply cooperatives ratios were 14.06 per- cent and 13.35 percent and marketing and mixed mar- keting cooperatives were 13.51 percent and 14.65 per- cent (table 18). Summary and Conclusions Local cooperatives studied in this report general- ly had strong financial statements. Assets increased 17 percent from 1994 to 1995. More than half of the accounts receivable were less than 30 days old. Investment in W&E  grew 7 percent. Owner equities grew 5 percent and member ownership in the local exceeds 50 percent. Net sales grew 8 percent. Total expenses grew 13 percent while net income grew slightly faster, at 14 percent.

They are also important to rural communities, often one of the largest employers, and provide considerable tax revenues. The extensive consolidation of local cooperatives during the past two decades reflects attempts to maintain an adequate size from which to provide their members with expanded products and markets. Despite consolidation, coopera- tives studied maintained an average of two branch locations from which to better serve members. These cooperatives maintained strong ties to regional cooperatives, CoBank  or the Bank for Cooperatives through which they obtained products, gained marketing opportunities, or borrowed needed capital. Investment in other cooperatives rose 8 percent from 1994. In turn, patronage refunds to local coopera- tives from regionals and the banks increased 37 per- cent and made the year profitable for 71 cooperatives that would have otherwise had losses. But, local coop- eratives cannot depend on large patronage refunds and with numerous locals losing money, further con- solidation of locals may be necessary in the future. An area of concern in the financial statements was the large buildup in inventories and subsequent increases in short-term debt. Grains and oilseeds inventories increased 51 percent; short-term debt climbed 72 percent and pushed up interest costs 42 percent. Inventory buildup and the subsequent growth in assets financed through additional debt had an impact on much of the ratio analysis: 1) Liquidity ratios, current and quick, declined slightly in 1995 due to increased grains and oilseeds  and farm supply inventories; 2) Leverage ratios-debt-to-total assets ratio, jumped from 0.21 in1994 to0.27 in1995 because assets increased 17 percent while debt increased almost 50 percent; 3) Activity ratios-total-asset-turnover ratio fell from 2.34 in 1994 to 2.16 in 1995 because total sales increased only 8 percent while assets increased 17 percent with much of the increase in inventories; and finallyBut increases in inventories are not expected to be a long-term trend. More current information sug- gests the inventory problem will be a non-issue in FY 1996. Prices for most grains and oilseeds  increased greatly this past year and most inventories were prob- ably liquidated to capture the higher prices. Other pressing issues are sure to arise in the coming year. Cooperatives are owned by their farmer/member/patrons. As long as those farmers want to own a business where they can purchase their supplies and market their products, cooperatives will continue to adapt to changing economic conditions.

Total assets reflect- ed increased inventory while increased interest costs lowered net income. 23Appendix table l-Common  size balance sheets for farm supply cooperatives, 1995 Cooperative size Item
