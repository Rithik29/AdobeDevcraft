Cells are the building blocks of all living things. Each type of cell plays a different role in  the human body. A stem cell is a special type of cell; specific types of body cells (such as skin cells, intestine cells, or red blood cells) are formed from stem cells.  Some stem cells are able to develop into every kind of body cell. Other stem cells are  more limited and can become several different kinds of cells, but not every kind of body cell. For example, stem cells in bone marrow (found inside your bones) can become red blood cells and white blood cells and all of the other parts of blood. However, these stem cells cannot become skin cells.  What is a stem cell line? Stem cells grown in a lab are called stem cell “lines.” A cell line is a group of cells that come from a single tissue sample (e.g., a blood sample or tissue taken from a muscle, which is called a “biopsy”). Each cell in a cell line will have the same genes as the tissue  sample that it came from. All stem cell lines: Can divide to make copies of themselves; for this reason, a stem cell line growing in a  lab could exist for a very long time, even longer than your lifetimeCan become some other types of body cellsContain the same genetic information as the person who gave the sample  Types of stem cells used in research There are three main types of stem cells that scientists use in research:  Body cells (such as skin cells or blood cells) that are made into stem cells in the labo-ratory are called induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells). It is believed that iPS cell lines can become any type of body cell. Stem cells that naturally occur in the body are called somatic or adult stem cells. These  cells cannot become any type of body cell but they can become some kinds of body  cells. Somatic stem cells are very difficult to grow in the lab. Embryonic stem cells (ES cells) are stem cells that are made from embryos at early  stages of development, when the embryo is a very small cluster of cells grown in a laboratory dish. ES cells can become any type of body cell. The embryos that are used to make human ES cells come from people who have had fertility treatments (in vitro fertilization or IVF) to have a baby. After the treatment, some individuals choose to donate their remaining embryos to research. If an embryo is used to make a stem cell line, it can no longer be used for fertility treatments.Why are researchers interested in stem cells? Studying stem cells can help scientists understand more about how the body works  and how disease develops and affects the body. Working with stem cells may help  researchers better understand different diseases and conditions, and find new treat-ments. Scientists hope one day to be able to use stem cells to help replace tissues in   the body that were damaged by disease or injury.  Benefits and risks of participating in stem cell research? By participating in stem cell research, there’s no direct benefit for you, but taking part  may help others in the future.  The risks involved in providing a tissue sample will depend on the type of sample you   are providing (e.g., blood draw, skin biopsy, cheek swab, bone marrow biopsy, etc.).  The research team will describe the procedure and risks during the informed consent process. A stem cell line made from your tissue contains your genetic information and may be linked to your identity. There is a risk this information could accidentally be shared with others. The researchers will explain how they guard against this. Participating in research is a choice Agreeing to take part in research is a process. The research team will discuss the  research with you. They will explain the study’s goals and possible risks and benefits. The research team will review an Informed Consent Form with you.  All study proce-dures, risks, and any possible benefits will be described in detail in this form.  Ask for help if you don’t understand something. You should never feel rushed or   pressured.

Perrenoud International Potash Institute, Worblaufen-Bern, Switzerland A second, completely revised edition of the IPI Research Topics No. 3 'Po- tassium and Plant Health' is now available. It contains a great number of data found in the literature concerning the effect of potassium on fungal diseases, insects, mites, nematodes, viruses and bacteria. The chapter summary and conclusions of this publication is reproduced below. 1. Summary and conclusions The beneficial effects of potassium on plant health had already been recognised by the end of the last century and the topic has received increasing attention in recent years. We found in the literature a total of 2449 indications concerning the relationship between potassium and plant health. These indications concern more than 400 diseases and pests. The desire to make the survey as complete as possible inevitably led to difficulty in evalua- tion since the data are extremely heterogeneous. Experiments were not always laid down with the prime aim of investigating the relationship between fertilisation and plant health. Even when trials.were directly related to the subject, trial techniques and conditions varied greatly and sometimes they were not clearly described in detail with regard totrial type(field, pot, nutrient solution, etc.), rates and type of fertiliser applied, soil K status, assessment and interpretation methods. Such variation explains why results are often contradictory and not comparable. Potassium may affect the reaction of a plant to pest or disease by: 1. Direct effects on the pathogen numbers, development, multiplication, sur- vival, vigour, length of life cycle. 2. Direct effects on attack severity on host: by effects on the internal metab- olism of the plant affecting food supply for the pathogen; by modifying the microclimate through changes in habit, density of growth, et. 3. Effects on establishment of the pathogen and spreading within the plant - through effects on plant structures (e.g. cell wall and cuticle thickness, tis- sues firmness) -through the functioning of the stomata. 4. Affecting the plant's ability to recover from pest or disease attack through the repair of damage or, more simply and most frequently, by a general improvement in growth and yield which is, after all, the farmer's overriding concern. Clearly and apparently adverse effect of a nutrient in increasing pathogen number and vigour is of no practical consequence if such an effect is accompanied by a marked increase in crop yield. The heteroge- neous nature of the available data and the complexity and variety of the ways in which potassium might be expected to modify the effects of dis- ease make it difficult to draw general conclusions. Nevertheless, we have attempted to do so. 1.1. Main conclusions a) Generally, potassium tends to improve plant health. The bibliographical data relating to all pests and diseases indicate a beneficial effect in 65% and a deleterious effect (increased diseases or pests) in 28% of cases (Table 1). Fungal and bacterial diseases were decreased in 7 cases out of ten, insects and mites in 6 cases out of ten, while nematodes and viruses were somewhat more often increased than decreased. Fungal diseases (63% of data) were more frequently investigated followed by insects and mites (19%).

Infield trials on low K soils, potassium had a beneficial effect in 87% of cases; in trials on other soils of unspecified K status (most cases) or sufficient or high in K (a few cases), K had a beneficial effect in 66% of cases (Table 2). Similarly 2 3/4 the average reduction in severity of fungal diseases was four times greater on low K soils. This would be explained if the unspecified soils included a large proportion of satisfactory or high K soils, as may appear likely, on which K would be expected to have less effect.

As shown in Figure 1, reductions in parasite development or damage ranging between 10-50% were observed in more than one third of cases and between 50-90% in 1 case out of 6.

KCI had a beneficial effect in 66% of the cases and K2SO4 (which was less frequently investigated) in 51% of the cases. 3 ... e) Effect of trial type. The beneficial effect of potassium was more frequently observed in field trials than in laboratory, pot and nutrient solution trials (Table 3). Table 3 Trial type and potassium effect Trial type % of cases showing beneficial K-effect Field trials 68% Laboratory, pot, nutrient solution trials, etc. 58% f) The effect of potassium on the yield or growth of infected plants. In 439 cases where the effect of potassium on yield or growth was measured the magnitude varied according to the parasite group (Table 4). The greater part of the data relate to fungal diseases, where the increase was 42%.The large growth increases reported for viruses and nematodes are inter-esting since these pathogens were more often increased by potassium. This shows that adequate potassium nutrition helps plants to tolerate pathogen attacks better or better to recover from them.

Potassium affects metabolism and in K defi- ciency, soluble compounds of low molecular weight accumulate, espe- cially soluble N compounds and sugars because of increased activity of decomposing enzymes and reduced phosphorylation. This is frequently accompanied by better parasite development probably because such compounds constitute a particularly suitable diet for them. Adequate potassium nutrition increases the content of phenols which can also playa beneficial role in plant resistance. There is a lack of precise data on thehost-parasite relationship. Potassium affects plant morphology, harden- ing the tissues with resulting improvement in resistance to disease pene- tration and insect feeding. Stomata are open for longer than necessary inpotassium deficiency increasing the chances of disease penetration. h) Nitrogen-potassium balance. All nutrients affect plant health but nitrogen and potassium are particularly important. Most authors agree that high nitrogen tends to decrease resistance and that high potassium has the opposite effect. The balance between these two nutrients is more impor- 4 3/4 tant than their absolute rate of application since relative N excess or rela-tive K deficiency tend to have much the same effect in reducing resis-tance. Fuchsand Grossmann [1972]who have published a very complete review on the effect of nutrition on resistance of cultivated plants wrote: 'Besides N, K has the strongest influence on resistance and this almost always in the opposite direction so that the ability to resist, particularly fungal and bacterial diseases, depends upon the N:K ratio. Generally speaking, K has a predominating influence on resistance.' When the NxK interaction was investigated in the papers reviewed for the present publication, this interaction was almost always positive which means that potassium increases crop resistance more when plants receive increasing nitrogen rates than when they are given no nitrogen. In other words increasing N rates decrease crop resistance less when K fer- tilization is adequate. Thus, potassium reduces the detrimental effects of nitrogen on plant health. 1.2. Practical considerations The use of fertilizers is one of a number of factors including climate, plant protection, varietal susceptibility, cultural techniques and soil conditions which may affect plant health. Balance, particularly between nitrogen and potassium, meaning that relative excess or deficiency of either should be avoided, is of great importance so that the level of K fertilizer should be adjusted to the level of nitrogen used.Thus, adequate K fertilization can be considered a kind of insurance against the risk of disease, especially on soils which are not sufficiently provided with potassium. More, and more systematic investigations are needed to improve our understanding of the relationships between fertilizer use and plant health. It is suggested that the following points should be observed in plan- ning such investigations: -potassium rates should be clearly defined and should include a control treatment without K or deficiency, sufficiency and a higher rate -the intensity of attacks should always be measured (quantified) S -soil K status should be indicated -rates of other nutrients (particularly N) should be clearly stated in quanti- tative terms -the effect of K on yield or growth should always be measured-it would be interesting to examine the differential effects of potassium on yield or growth of diseased and healthy plants -the effect of potassium on plant metabolism and plant morphology (as they affect resistance and tolerance) The realisation of such a programme requires the close collaboration of agronomists, plant pathologists, physiologists and biochemists.

Received: 26 November 2012; in revised form: 5 December 2012 / Accepted: 10 December 2012 /  Published: 14 December 2012    Abstract: The practice of adding organic amen dments to crop so ils is undergoing  resurgence as an efficient way to restore soil  organic matter content and to improve soil  quality. The quantity and quality of the orga nic matter inputs affect soil physicochemical  properties and soil microbiota, influencing diffe rent parameters such as microbial biomass  and diversity, community struct ure and microbial activities or  functions. The influence of  organic amendments on soil quality has also effects on crop production and plant health.  The enhancement of soil suppressiveness us ing organic amendments has been widely  described, especially for soil-borne diseases. However, there is great variability in the  effectiveness of suppression depending on the nature of the amendment, the crop, the  pathogen, and the environmental conditions. Although the effects of organic amendments on soil properties have been widely studied, relationships between th ese properties and soil  suppressiveness are not still well understood. Ch anges in soil physicochemical parameters  may modulate the efficacy of suppression. Howe ver, the parameters more frequently  associated to disease suppression appear to be related to soil microbiota, such as microbial  biomass and activity, the abundance of speci fic microbial groups and some hydrolytic  activities. This review focuses on the eff ect of organic amendments on soil microbial  populations, diversity and activit ies; their ability to enhance plant health through disease  suppression; and which of the parameters affected by the organic amendments are  potentially involved in soil suppressiveness.

Organic Matter and Soil Quality  Soil organic matter, one of the main indicators of soil quality, is fundamental to the long-term  sustainability of agroecosystems a nd plays a critical role in global bi ochemical cycles [1]. In natural  soils, a range of drivers of global change is aff ecting the balance between organic matter inputs and  outputs. In agricultural soils, land management is an additional key factor affecting this balance.  Several crop management practices could help in th e maintenance of soil qu ality, for example, crop  rotation, low tillage, cover crops and ex ternal organic inputs. Among them, the direct addition of organic  amendments to crop soils can improve soil quality by affecting many parameters , such as soil aeration,  structure, drainage, moisture, holding capacity, nu trient availability and microbial ecology [2,3].   Organic amendments, such as animal manures and composts, were commonly used in the past for  agricultural production due to their va lue as fertilizers and for their ability to improve plant health. The  widespread availability of chemical  fertilizers and pesticides led to  the replacement of those organic  materials by these highly effective and inexpensive synthetic agrochemicals [4]. The small amount of  organic matter input to agroecosystems during the past  50 years has led to a decline in soil structure  and health, which has been associated to an increase in plant diseases and other pest problems [2]. At  present, however, there is an increasing intere st, intensified by environmental concern, in the  replacement of synthetic agrochemicals with organic amendments, which are experiencing a  resurgence in popularity as efficien t and environmentally benign altern atives to chemical fertilizers  and pesticides [4]. The effect of the organic am endments on soil physical, chemical and biological  parameters has been widely studied. The improveme nt of soil quality through organic amendments has  a proved effect on crop production and plant health, and some of these effects have been related to the  enhancement of soil suppressiveness against soil-bor ne pathogens [2]. This soil suppressiveness has  been reliably related to soil microorganisms and its  activities and for that reason, the effects of the  organic amendments on soil microbiota is a ke y issue for understanding the role of this old  management practice on disease suppression. This re view focuses on the specif ic effect of organic  amendments on soil microbial populations, diversity an d activities; their ability to enhance plant health  through disease suppression; and which of the para meters affected by the organic amendments are  potentially involved in soil suppressiveness.  2. Organic Soil Amendments and Their Effect on Soil Quality  Soil quality is defined as the cap acity of the soil to function with in ecosystem boundaries to sustain  biological productivity, maintain en vironmental quality, and promote plant and animal health [5].  There is a broad agreement in the literature that soil quality is meas ured by a combination of physical,  chemical and biological soil characteristics (see Fi gure 1). The exact combination of the parameters  best used to describe soil quality varies. Soil h ealth is a newer less defined term and does generally  refer to the expansion of the biol ogical aspect of soil quality. The te rm “soil health” is preferred by Diversity 2012 , 4 477    some authors because it portrays soil as a living,  dynamic system whose functions are mediated by a  diversity of living organisms that require manageme nt and conservation [3]. However, these terms are  often used interchangeably in prac tice and they will be used synonymously throughout this paper. Soil  quality cannot be measured directly, but soil propert ies that are sensitive to changes in management  can be used as indicators. Indicators of soil quality  are commonly classified in physical, chemical and  biological parameters [5]. Depending on the soil mana gement practices, the quant ity and quality of the  organic matter input differ. These inputs have a strong effect not only on the physicochemical  properties of the soil but also on its biological components, affecting the quantity, diversity and  functions of soil microbiota. In this review, we want to focus on the biolog ical indicators of soil  quality, analyzing how the addition of organic amen dments could affect so il health through their  effects on soil microbiota. These effects could be re lated to microbial bioma ss, microbial diversity,  community structure and mi crobial activities [6–9].  Figure 1.  Parameters affecting soil quality and some  of the methodologies for their assessment.    2.1. Microbial Populations and Community Composition  The enhancement of microbial biomass is one of th e aims of some cultural practices such as the  addition of organic amendments [10] . In fact, the addition of different  types of compos t to crop soils  has been shown to be related to an increase in microbial bioma ss in comparison with unamended or  equally inorganic fertilized soil s [7,11,12]. Many authors have reporte d the enhancement of specific  microbial groups, depending on the type of organic matter added as amendment. The enhancement of  culturable heterotrophic bacteria ha s been shown to be affected by th e addition of animal and vegetal  commercial compost, composted almond shells and co mposted yard waste [6–8]. Several studies have  shown enhancement in specific mi crobial groups, such as fluorescent pseudo monads [11,13] and  endospore-forming bacteria [7,1 4] by amendments from both vegetal and anim al origin.   Organic amendments influence not only on the abunda nce of soil microbial populations but also on  soil bacterial diversity, as has been shown by many studies. For example, Yang  et al.  [15] and Bonilla  SOIL  QUALITY PLANT  HEALTHCulture‐dependent: Isolation and plate counts; Community  level  physiological  profile Culture‐independent: Fingerprinting  methods; Hybridization   (PhyloChip); Real‐time PCR; MetagenomicsMicrobial   activity: FDA hydrolysis;   RespirationEnzymatic  assays: Hydrolytic  activities (i.e.  chitinase,  cellulase) Molecular  methods: Hybridization   (GeoChip);   RT‐Q‐PCR; Metatranscriptomics; Metaproteomics; MetametabolomicspH, texture, salinity, nutrients,   cations, organic mater Microbial   diversityPhysico‐chemical  properties Microbial   functionsDiversity 2012 , 4 478    et al.  [7] used numerical diversity indices ( i.e., Shannon-Weaver index) ba sed on culture-independent  fingerprinting methods to compare microbial diversity of amended and unamended soils. These studies  showed that the amendment with ma nures, yard waste or compost enha nces soil bacterial diversity,  although other authors have not found any effect on soil microbial diversit y when studying similar  amendments by using analogous methodologies [11,16].  However, microbial diversity is a highly  complex parameter and its measurement by diversity indices is usually less informative than  qualitative community structure an alysis. In fact, even when microbial diversity was unaffected,  organic amendments have shown a strong influence on the soil microbial community composition.  Pérez-Piqueres  et al.  [8] described a clear infl uence of different types of  compost on bacterial and  fungal communities composition in soil s from different locations by us ing terminal restriction length  polymorphism (T-RFLP). Many other authors have show n the influence of a wide variety of organic  amendments on bacterial and fungal communitie s composition using whole community analysis  methodologies based on the direct extraction of lip ids (PLFA) and nucleic acids (T-RFLP, ARISA,  ARDRA, DGGE) from the soil [ 7,11,12,17]. These and other methodologies used for the molecular  assessment of soil microbial commun ities have been widely described and have been previously  reviewed (see Figure 1) [18,19].  2.2. Microbial Activity and Soil Functioning  Many efforts have been made to characterize th e genetic diversity pres ent in soils. However,  microbial diversity itself does not necessarily a ffect ecosystem function ing. For example, Wertz  et al.  [20]  caused an experimental depletion of microbial dive rsity by dilution. After in cubation, the structure,  cell abundance and activity of den itrifying and nitrite-oxidizing co mmunities were characterized.  Increasing dilution led to a progressive decrease in community di versity as assessed  by the number of  DGGE bands, while community functioning was not impaired when cell a bundance recovered after  incubation. Actually, it is widely accepted that species identity and community composition, rather  than richness, matters for specific microbial pr ocesses [20,21]. Furthermore, some studies have  reported that phylogenetic and functional changes in the soil are not reliably correlated [22]. In fact, there  is evidence of a direct effect of organic amendments  on soil functions without  any changes in microbial  community structure [16]. Many char acteristics of soil mi crobial communiti es, such as high functional  redundancy and physiological versatility, could be involved in the independence from  biodiversity of many  ecosystem functions [21]. Phylogenetic diversity al one is therefore not sufficient for understanding  how microbial communities work, and the functional di versity of the ecosystems must be considered.   Soil microbial activity is the overall quantific ation of soil functioning, including carbon and  nitrogen biogeochemical cycles, organic matter decomposition . This microbial activity could be  measured by fluorescein diacetate (FDA)  hydrolysis, soil respiration or ot her specific activities (Figure 1).  Many studies have shown that organic soil amendments  increase total microbial activity, measured as  soil respiration [6,8,11]. Other studies have analyzed  the effect of soil am endments on particular  hydrolytic activities invol ved in C, P and N biogeochemical cycles such as dehydrogenases,  phosphatases, proteases, urease or β-glucosidase. In general, the res ponse of these enzymes is strongly  affected by the level of soil organic matter. For th at reason, they usually re spond positively to organic  amendments in degraded or semiarid soils and they have been considered suit able indicators of soil Diversity 2012 , 4 479    quality in this type of study [23–25]. However, the response of these enzymes in soils with naturally  high organic matter is more co mplicated and depends largely on native physicochemical soil  properties, the type of amendmen t and the application rate [9,26]. On the other hand, one enzyme  activity alone cannot provide complete informatio n on the nutrient status of a soil. Nannipieri  et al.  [27]  defended that the simultaneous measurement and the multivariate analysis of several enzyme activities  may describe better soil microbi al activity. This approa ch has been widely used; for example by   Tiquia  et al.  [28] who obtained an overall picture of the enzymatic activity in different types of  compost, revealing differences in composts and compost maturity.   3. Organic Amendments and Thei r Effect on Plant Health  The beneficial effects of organic materials on different aspects of plant health have been widely  reviewed by several authors [2,29,30] . Different works have shown th at organic amendments to crop  soils can increase plant growth and crop yield both in herbaceous and woody plants such as maize,  wheat and avocado [31–33]. However, most of the studi es have been focused in  the ability of these  organic materials to enhance natural soil suppressiven ess. Suppressive soil has b een described as a soil  in which “the pathogen does not establish or persis t, establishes but causes little or no damage, or  establishes and causes disease fo r a while but thereafter the disease is less important” [34].   There is sufficient data to indicate that organi c amendments can reduce the incidence of diseases  caused by a wide range of plant pathogens includi ng bacteria, fungi, and nematode species [2,35].  Although some authors have demonstrated the enhancement of soil suppressiveness by both  composted and uncomposted amendments [14], several works have stated that composted materials are  more suppressive to root rots than uncomposted ones [35]. The use of compost for the suppression of  such diseases has been widely reported  and reviewed [29,30]. For example, Yogev  et al.  [36] showed  that composts based on plant-waste resi dues suppress diseases caused by different formae speciales  of  Fusarium oxysporum . Vegetal composts were also able to de lay or decrease the symptoms of avocado  root rots caused by Phytophthora cinnamomi  [37] and  Rosellinia necatrix  [38]. In fact, compost  amendments have a consistently demonstrated suppressive effect on several soil-borne diseases, such as  damping-off and root rots ( Pythium ultimum , Rhizoctonia solani , Rosellinia necatrix,  Phytophthora   spp.) and wilts ( Fusarium oxysporum  and Verticillium dahliae ) in a wide range of crops [14,36,38–43]  (Table 1). The use of organic amendments or mulc hes has been successfully incorporated into the  integrated management of certain diseases, such as the avocado root rot caused by P. cinnamomi , in  combination with genetic host re sistance, fungicide applications  or physical in activation [44].  However, the suppressive capacity of different type s of compost differs dramatically depending on the  type of organic matter, plant hos t and pathogen species that are i nvolved; and several authors have  reported negative effects, such as ph ytotoxicity or an increa sed incidence of the disease, related to the  use of organic amendments [45,46]. The identificatio n of the mode of action of each amendment could  be crucial for the incorporation of  effective organic amendments to the integrated management of soil- borne diseases [2].

The Basis of Soil Suppressiveness   It has been demonstrated that th e quantity and quality of the orga nic matter inputs affect both the  physicochemical properties of the soil and the biotic factors associated to the soil microbiota, such as  microbial biomass, diversity, comm unity structure and biochemical ac tivities [6–9]. Particular abiotic  factors, such as changes in pH or nitrogen conten t, have been related to the control of some plant  diseases [47,48]. However, the sterili zation of the soil or of the amen dment usually lead s to a loss of  suppressiveness, suggesting a direct  effect of the microbiota on dise ase suppression [36,39]. In fact,  the influence of organic mulches or amendments on the microbiota of the soil  and the rhizosphere has  been consistently related to th e suppressiveness of the soil for several plant diseases [19,49,50]. The  effect of organic amendments on soil suppr essiveness has commonly been related to a general  suppression mechanism. The input of organic matter may lead to an increase in total microbial  biomass and activity in soil, causing the inhibiti on of the pathogen by competition for resources or  through other direct forms of antagonism. No speci fic microorganism is responsible for general  suppression, but all the microbiota cooperate for th e generation of a hostile environment for disease  development [35,50]. This general mechanism plays an important role in some cases of disease  suppression, but because it is base d on nonspecific mechanisms, it is ex pected to be effective against  any pathogen. However, the suppression of multiple diseases by organic amendment has only been  described in a few studies, and th e suppressive efficiency varies greatly, depending on the pathogen.  This finding suggests that the e nhancement of disease suppression with amendments or compost is  often disease-specific [51] . The most suitable hypothesis is that  in most cases suppressive soils owe  their activity to a combination of a general and a specific suppression . The specific suppression is  superimposed over the background of general suppression and is due, at least par tially, to the effects of Diversity 2012 , 4 481    individual or selected groups of microorganisms that affect pathoge n growth or infection through a  particular biological control mechanism, such as  competition, parasitism, microbial antagonism,  induced plant resistance, or a combination of  these mechanisms [35,50]. To determine which  management practices or amendments have suppressi ve capability, it is important to identify the  microbial populations and associ ated processes that could account  for disease suppression [49].   3.2. Looking for Indicators of Soil Suppressiveness   Many studies have tried to relate changes in both the abiotic and bio tic factors of the soil to the  inhibition of different diseases, searching th e basis of disease s uppression [13,14,51–55]. This  information has been used in several attempts in the identification of key factors involved in soil  suppressiveness, looking for predictor parameters of  the suppressive potential  of the soils or the  organic amendments [10,19,51]. However, this is a very complex issue since it is not possible to  measure the suppressive potential  by numerical values. Furthermor e, the search for a parameter  universally related to the suppression of every pat hogen in every condition has been unsuccessful. This  is the main reason why most research studies deal with well-known indicators of disease suppression.   3.2.1. Physicochemical Soil Properties  Several physicochemical parameters of the soil , such as soil pH, nitrogen, carbon and organic  carbon content, as well as severa l cations and oligoelements, have  been often related to disease  suppression. Different studies have tried to unravel  the role of the physicochemical soil properties in  each particular experimental system. As an exampl e, Tenuta and Lazarovits [48] showed that the  accumulation of ammonia and nitrous acid released from nitrogenous amendments, such as meat and  bone meal, suppresses the soil-borne pathogen Verticillium dahliae . In the study performed by  Heyman  et al.  [56] the concentration of cal cium in the soil was negativel y correlated to the incidence  of Aphanomyce s root rot of pea. Greenhouse bioassays w ith different Ca compounds showed that  disease severity was directly related to water-sol uble Ca in the soil, whereas  it was not consistently  affected by soil sterilization. Bonanomi  et al.  [51] showed that amendmen t’s pH was in general not  statistically correlated to di sease suppression except for Fusarium  species. In fact, some studies as that  performed by Borrero  et al.  [54], established the beneficial effect s of high soil pH on the reduction of  Fusarium  wilt of tomato. Nevertheless, even in this work, the sterilization of the amendments  increased disease incidence, support ing the biological basis of diseas e suppression. However, there is  no an universal rule linking physicochemical parame ters and disease suppression and both positive and  negative correlations with disease incidence, as well as many cases  of no-correlation, have been  reported [10]. In general, the physic ochemical variables have been stat istically demonstrated to be less  informative predictors of the suppressive potential  of organic amendments than the enzymatic and  microbiological variables [51].The most feasible hypothesis is that disease suppression usually has a  biological explanation and physicochemical parameters  could affect growth and activities of soil  microbiota, including pathogens, and therefore it could modulate diseas e suppression efficacy.   Diversity 2012 , 4 482    3.2.2. Microbial Biomass, Diversit y and Community Structure   Disease suppressiveness has usually been related to a global increase in soil microbial biomass.  Theoretically, a large amount of biom ass creates a competitive environmen t deleterious to pathogens [10].  In fact, an increase in microbial biomass has been directly related to soil suppressiveness, both by  direct measurement [55] and by culture-based me thods [13,57]. However, th is relationship is not  consistent, and other studies have shown a lack of correlation between thes e two parameters [58].  Microbial diversity has long been considered a key factor in dis ease suppressiveness. Accordingly,  several works have reported direct correlations between quantitative divers ity indices and disease  suppression [52,59]. However, other works have shown weak and high ly variable correl ations or have  failed to identify a correlation [ 11,60]. Microbial diversity is a comp lex issue and its measurement by  diversity indices is usually less informative than qualitative community structure analysis. Most data  suggests that community composition is more im portant than richness fo r specific microbial   processes [21]. In fact, changes in microbial co mmunity composition have been widely related to  suppressive organic amendments and farming practices , regardless of the quantitative differences in  diversity indices [8,53]. Indeed, the structure of soil microbi al communities is of pr imary interest when  studying soil suppressiveness.   Soil suppressiveness is commonly related to the pr esence of or the increase in specific microbial  populations. Some of the microbial groups most frequently connected to disease suppression are total  culturable bacteria [8,53] , pseudomonads or fluoresc ent pseudomonads  [13,52,57], Trichoderma  spp. [13]  and endospore-forming bacteria [14]; Bonanomi  et al.  [51] have shown a high percentage of positive  correlations between abundance of  these groups and soil suppressive ness. However, many studies only  demonstrate correlations and subsequently, they s uggest the potential implication of these microbial  groups in disease suppression. Nevert heless, correlation does not impl y a cause-effect relationship, so  it would be necessary for a deeper analysis to re liably connect a specific microorganism or population  to disease suppression. Initial stud ies in this field were  based on the isolation and characterization of  numerous culturable soil microorganisms. The isol ates, including bacteria, actinomycetes and fungi,  were usually screened, for example, by their ability to suppress the pathogen  in vitro  or to reduce  disease symptoms when they were inoculated in a conductive soil [ 61,62]. The “microbe hunters” have  identified and isolated many micr oorganisms responsible or contribut ing to the suppression of plant  diseases. Many of these effective antagonists of soil-born e pathogens are, in fact, members of the  microbial groups mentioned above. One of the best ex amples is the suppression of take-all disease of  wheat by strains of fluorescent Pseudomonas spp., demonstrated by Weller  et al.  [63]. The  Pseudomonas  spp. strains were originally isolated in Washington State from wheat rhizosphere in a  soil naturally suppressive to take-all and then selected by  in vitro  antibiosis to Gaeumannomyces  graminis  var. tritici , the causal agent of this disease. These bacteria applied to wheat seeds suppressed  take-all disease in both greenhouse and field expe riments [63]. On the other hand, in Western  Australia, wheat take-all suppres sion has been attributed to Trichoderma  spp., which comprise a major  proportion of the total microbi al community only in diseas e-suppressive soils [64]. Trichoderma  koningii , the most frequently isolated species, has been  shown to protect wheat against take-all disease  in field trials in Australia, China, and the Unite d States. However, within  a region, the level of  protection provided by T. koningii  can dramatically vary betw een field sites depending on the Diversity 2012 , 4 483    physicochemical soil properties [65]. The comb ination of both biocontrol microorganisms, T. koningii  and certain Pseudomonas  strains, has shown to provide greater suppressive effect than T. koningii   applied alone and much better disease control than bacterial treatments alone [66]. The identification  of a specific microorganism reliably involved in  disease suppression does not mean that this  microorganism is solely responsible  of disease control. The suppressi ve effect could be more likely  related to a combination of parameters, both biotic and abiotic. Actually, the general suppression is not  even related to a specific group of microorganisms,  and many factors and populat ions cooperate for the  inhibition of the pathogen or the development of th e disease. Different orga nic amendments stimulate  a different spectrum of microbial groups, which seems to be closely related to their effectiveness  against different pathogens. This effect on soil micr obial communities even varies over time, together  with amendment decomposition or environmental cha nge, so the suppressive ability of the amendment  may also vary with time [51,67]. In addition, the phenomenon of disease suppr ession might be related  to specific functions or activities of soil microorganisms rather than the simple presence or abundance  of particular populati ons in the soil.   3.2.3. Microbial Functio ns and Activities  Total microbial activity has often been relate d to soil suppressiveness [8,40,55], suggesting an  underlying mechanism of general s uppression. However, recent review s have shown great variability  in the relationship between these parameters depending on the pathogen involved [50,51]. This  variability agrees with the wider range of specific mechanisms that are already known to be involved  in disease suppression [50]. Multiparametric analyses  of the changes in the metabolic or enzymatic  abilities of soil microbial communities have been su ccessfully performed to determine the effect of  organic amendments on soil functions [68], thus allowing discrimination between suppressive and  conductive soils [8,41]. However, usually  this type of analysis is in sufficient for indicating a single  mechanism as the main responsible of the biocontrol  and the true cause of di sease suppression remains  unknown in many cases. Some authors have found cons istent correlations among specific functional  parameters and disease suppression [51]. Just in some  cases, this correlation ha s been proved the actual  cause of soil suppressiveness. One of the best examples is the production of antibiotic compounds.  Again referring to take-all decline of wheat , the suppression of this disease by fluorescent  Pseudomonas  spp. has been related to the production of  phenazines [69] and especially to the  production of 2,4-diacetylphlor oglucinol [70]. The abundan ce of antibiotic-producing Pseudomonas   spp. in the rhizospheric soil has been reliably associ ated to the natural suppressiveness of the soil to  take-all disease of wheat [71]. Th e suppression of this disease by Trichoderma  spp. also seems to be  related to antibiotics production, specifically pyrone compounds [ 72,73]. However, non-producing  strains are able to reduce take-all, suggesting that other mechanisms of  disease control must contribute  to the phenomenon of disease suppre ssion. In fact, many different mechan isms have been shown to be  involved in the control of plant diseases by both bacterial isolates  and Trichoderma species: production  of antibiotic compounds, competition for nutrients and niches, activation of plan t defenses, predation and  parasitism, and hydrolytic activities,  such as chitinases and glucanas es. The importance and particular  contribution of each mechanism in disease suppression ar e different for each part icular disease [74,75].  Diversity 2012 , 4 484    Some hydrolytic activities,  including those mentione d above, have been cons istently related to soil  suppressiveness and the biocontrol of soil-borne pathogens. The main  component of fungal cell walls  is chitin. Chitinolytic microorganisms have been ex tensively studied for their potential use in the  biological control of fungal pathogens. In fact, chiti nolytic activity has been re lated to the control of  several fungal diseases by single biocontrol microorganisms [76,77], and also using compost [78].  Chae  et al.  [78] tested a chitin-compost, composed of cr ab shell at 30%, against late blight of pepper  caused by Phytophthora capsici . The chitin-compost showed the ability  to reduce late blight symptoms  in plant assays and the compost wate r extract inhibite d the growth of P. capsici in vitro , in both cases  in comparison with a control-comp ost without crab shell. The numbe r of chitinase-producing bacteria  in the rhizosphere and the enzy matic activities chitinase and β-1,3-glucanase were largely higher in  plants amended with the chitin-c ompost. Instead of the strategy of  the microbe hunters, in this  approach they are not looking for si ngle biocontrol strains;  the aim is the design  of highly effective  amendments, as example, the chitinolytic compost.   4. Future Perspectives  Molecular methods based on nucleic acid sequences  have been a key stone for unraveling both  genetic and functional diversity of soils in the last decades. The ove rcoming of culture-based methods  led to the actual understand ing of microbial diversit y. In fact, the vast majority of the studies  estimating soil microbial diversity and analyzing microbial community structure compiled in this  review are based on the analysis of ribosomal RNA sequences. Func tional diversity has also been  addressed by molecular analyses of functional gene s involved in biogeochemical cycles and antibiotic  or enzyme production [18,79]. Most of these work s were based on fingerprinting methods and the  construction and screening of clone  libraries. Several type s of DNA microarrays have been developed  and evaluated for microbial community analysis. Community genome arrays as the PhyloChip, a high- density 16S rDNA microarray, are considered effec tive tools for the analysis  of complex microbial  communities. A combined approach of PhyloChip-based metagenomics and culture-dependent functional analyses has been recently used for the analysis of the rhizosphere microbiome in  suppressive soils [80]. In this study, Mendes  et al.  have identified key bacterial taxa belonging to  Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Ac tinobacteria, consistently associ ated with the suppression of  Rhizoctonia  root rot in sugar beet. Especi ally interesting types of micr oarrays are the functional gene  arrays, such as the GeoChip [81]. This array contains more than 24,000 probes from al l of the known  genes involved in various biogeochemical, ecological and environmental processes and it can be used  to assess functional gene diversity and expression in large numbers of soil samples. Although they are  still considered an effective and economical tool for the analysis of complex microbial communities,  DNA microarrays are being rapidl y superseded by next-generation sequencing approaches. The fast  improvement of these next-gener ation or high-throughput sequencing technologies, as well as sequence  analysis bioinformatics tools, is boosting knowledge of na tural ecosystems func tioning. Sequencing of  metagenomic DNA provides at the same time phyloge netic and functional gene information about  microbial communities. Alternatively, one can direc tly extract and sequence RNA to determine which  microbes are active and which genes are transcribe d [82]. Metagenomic studies, recently based on  shotgun sequencing of environmental DNA, are being ca rried out with suppressive soils. Indeed, there Diversity 2012 , 4 485    is a trans-European project on disease-suppressi ve soils denoted METACONTROL [83]. However, the  next-generation sequencing techniques  have lately arrived to the study of organic amendments to crop  soils. Few examples are available and most of th em are not based on shotgun metagenomic and they  are restricted to tag-encoded amp licon sequencing of bacterial and f ungal ribosomal RNA [84,85]. It is  expected that with the developmen t of such techniques and their application to suppressive amendment  studies, more of its secrets will be revealed.  5. Conclusions  Despite the increasing amount of information re garding suppressive organic amendments, some  challenges remain. The variability in the response of  different parameters to soil organic amendments  and their variable relati onship with disease suppression both sugge st that the organisms or activities  involved in the suppressive effect  may differ depending on the particul ar pathosystem and the nature  of the amendments used [50]. The ultimate effect on pathogen activity, e xpressed as plant disease, will  depend on the particular effects on biotic and abiotic soil parameters and the complex and dynamic  interactions among all members of the system [67] . The composition, diversity, functions and activities  of soil microbial communities seem to be of c onsiderable importance in disease suppression. Of  course, the plant also plays a si gnificant role in this phenomenon a nd the induction of plant defense  mechanisms could be an important compone nt of compost suppressiveness [86].   In conclusion, the use of organic amendments or composts for the suppression of plant pathogens  could be a promising and environmentally benign al ternative to chemical pesticides. The introduction  of this practice in the integrated c ontrol of plant diseases could also help in maintenance of soil organic  matter, thereby improving soil quality [4]. However, despite the numerous positive reports, its  practical application is still limited.  The main reason for this is the lack of reliable prediction and  quality control tools for evaluation of the level and speci ﬁcity of the suppression effect. Unfortunately,  a single chemical, physical or bi ological parameter does not pred ict suppression, and thus quality  control is dependent on bioassays designed for a speci fic pathogen or disease. Deeper understanding of  microbial ecology processes could also provide directions for possible manipulations of the  community leading to a reproducible suppressive amendment. Combining measures of microbial  structural diversity with functiona l traits should be explored in re lation to soil and root health in  agricultural systems. In this sense, shotgun metagenomic base d on high-throughput sequencing  technologies will be crucial to answer the main ques tions in this field. This strategy not only reveals  “who is there” (richness) but also answers questions such as “how many are there” (abundance) as well  as “what are they doing there” (f unction). Investigating structural a nd functional diversity in amended  and suppressive soils will give a much more detailed picture of the interactions among  microorganisms, soil, and plants, helping in the iden tification of microorganism s or processes relevant  to disease suppression [82,87].

"Plant stem cell niches YVONNE STAHL and RÜDIGER SIMON* Institut für Genetik, Heinrich-Heine Universität Düsseldorf, Düsseldorf, Germany ABSTRACT  Stem cells are required to support the indeterminate growth style of plants. Meristems are a plant´s stem cell niches that foster stem cell survival and the production of descendants destined for differentiation. In shoot meristems, stem cell fate is decided at the populational level. The size of the stem cell domain at the meristem tip depends on signals that are exchanged withcells of the organizing centre underneath. In root meristems, individual stem cells are controlled by direct interaction with cells of the quiescent centre that lie in the immediate neighbourhood. Analysis of the interactions and signaling processes in the stem cell niches has delivered someinsights into the molecules that are involved and revealed that the two major niches for plant stem cells are more similar than anticipated. KEY WORDS: stem cells, initials, root meristem, shoot meristem I. Stem cell primer What are stem cells?  Stem cells are cells capable of unlimited self-renewal that have the potential to generate differentiated descendants. Differ- entiation can be defined as qualitative changes in the cellularphenotype that are caused by changes in gene expression that ultimately lead to functional competence. Most of the current discussions about the qualities and characteristics of stem cellsstems from research on animals. There, stem cells are found at different developmental stages and in a variety of tissues. For example, there are hemopoietic stem cells residing in the bonemarrow that can produce a range of different blood cells, or epidermal stem cells that can regenerate skin after injuries. Such stem cells are specialised for the production and regeneration ofspecific cell types. With this restricted potential to generate one or more highly defined types of offspring, they are described as multi- or pluripotent. The only truly totipotent animal stem cellsthat can form all cell types of the body are embryonic stem cells, or the zygote. During ontogeny, the daughters of these initially totipotent stem cells become gradually restricted and differentiateinto the stem cells of adult tissues. Do plants have bona fide stem cells? This question was controversial, since protoplasting and  in vitro  culture allows regeneration of embryos or whole plantlets from differentiated leaf cells of many plant species. This would suggest that all leaf cells can act as stem cells – or that the stem cell concept cannotbe applied to plants. However, the traditional view of animal stem cell potential has been recently challenged with the discovery that stem cell fates in adults are still plastic and can be altered by cuesInt. J. Dev.

The evolving view that emerged from numerous studies is that stem cells are not neces- sarily specific cellular entities, but that they represent a function that can be assumed by numerous cell types. In the most extreme view, all cells receiving the correct signal (or a combination of signals) will then adopt the stem cell state. Thus, leaf cells that areprotoplasted and grown in tissue culture will be exposed to a variety of new signals such as plant hormones or compounds released into the medium and these signals can trigger the fateswitch to an undifferentiated, stem cell-like state that allows to regrow an entire plant. Indeed, a receptor-kinase perceiving an as yet unidentified signal has been identified that promotes embryo-genic competence of cultured Arabidopsis cells (Hecht  et al. , 2001). So the hidden totipotency of many plant cells that can be revealed in tissue culture appears less alien when we accept themodern view of stem cell identity as a transient cellular state that is controlled by appropriate environmental cues. Where do they thrive?  Noting that local regulators direct a stem cell´s fate puts extra emphasis on the microenvironment, or niche, where stem cellsreside (Watt and Hogan, 2000). Stem cell descendants that become evicted from these safe havens may face terminal differ- entiation or death. Identifying these niches and finding the stemcells within has not been a trivial task in animal systems: with a few exceptions, such as the  Drosophila  gonads and peripheral ner- vous system, where stem cells have a defined orientation relativeto surrounding cells, molecular markers are needed to identify stem cells in most tissues. A plant´s stem cell niches are the meristems and since plant cells are immobile, stem cells are480    Y. Stahl and R. Simon readily identified by their position within meristems. There are several types of meristems: The shoot, root and vascular mer- istems all carry their separate and specialized set of stem cells. How do they work?  Although stem cells have a high capacity for self renewal and are essential for tissue production and/or regeneration, theydivide only infrequently. In most cases, stem cell descendants do not directly differentiate, but form an intermediate cell population of more rapidly dividing committed progenitors. These transitamplifying cells (TA cells) have a limited proliferative capacity and an already restricted differentiation potential. Their main task is to increase the population of cells generated from a single stem celldivision. Because stem cell divisions result in two different types of progeny, they are intrinsically asymmetric. However, there are atleast two general strategies how this asymmetric outcome can be achieved. In the case of invariant or divisional asymmetry, stem cell divisions produce strictly one daughter that remains as a stemcell, the other daughter differentiates or aquires TA cell fate (Fig. 1). The second option is populational or environmental asymme- try: after division, stem cell daughters have a finite probability ofbeing either stem cells or committed progenitors that follow a path to differentiation (Fig. 2). Although individual divisions may pro- duce two stem cells or two differentiating daughters, the systemis balanced at steady state and produces on average one stem cell and one differentiating cell per division. The differences between these two strategies lie mainly in the mechanisms ofregulation: Divisional asymmetry can involve an asymmetric partitioning of cell fate determinants, or the displacement of a daughter from the stem cell niche. Populational asymmetry de-pends on extrinsic controls that sense and communicate the size of the stem cell population and regulates the probability of stem cell daughters to maintain stem cell fate. Both strategies involveextensive communication between stem cells and their niches. We will discuss in this review if and how these alternative strategies may be employed by plant stem cells and what we knowso far about the molecules involved. II. Deconstructing plant stem cell niches: shoot mer- istems The shoot meristem gives rise to the above-ground organs of a plant and produces the main stem. At its flanks, new special- ized meristems can be initiated that produce flowers. Both types of meristems are structurally very similar. Cells in thesemeristems are arranged in layers and zones. Layers  Sections through the shoot meristem centre along the api- cal-basal axis reveal an organisation into discrete cell layers (Fig. 3). The outermost cell layer (L1) consists of epidermal progenitor cells, the next cell layer (L2) will gives rise to sub-epidermal tissues and also to the gametes. Cells underneath produce the majority of the plant´s ground tissue; although they are not arranged in a single sheath like layer, they are calledlayer 3 (L3). L1, L2 and L3 represent cell clones that are maintained during development. This is possible because cell divisions in L1 and L2 are strictly anticlinal (cell walls perpen-dicular to surface) and daughter cells therefore stay in their layer of origin. In the L3, cells can divide in all directions, but cells generally do not invade the adjacent L2. Such a strictseparation of layers in the entire meristems necessitates stem cell activity in each individual layer. This layered organisation is found in most angiosperm shoot meristems, but its functionalrelevance is unclear. However, a recent study by Reinhardt and colleagues (Reinhardt  et al. , 2003) showed that removing only the L1 layer by laser ablation affects the orientation of celldivisions in the L2. These now shift from their normal anticlinal pattern to periclinal, causing local tissue outgrowth. So one role of the L1 is to control division patterns in deeper meristemregions. Furthermore, meristems arrested development when the entire L1 was removed, suggesting that the L1 also provides an essential function or signal for meristem maintenance. Zones  Organ primordia that develop into leaves or flowers origi- nate from the meristem flank or peripheral zone of the shoot meristem. Stem cells are located in the central zone of the meristem, which is surrounded by the peripheral zone. Cells ina deeper region of the meristem form the rib zone that gives rise to the majority of the ground tissue in the plant body. Chimeras have been used to identify the fate of descendants from thethree zones. In sectorial chimeras, only a part of the plant is marked with a cell clone. The size of this clone or sector along the apical-basal axis indicates for how long the progenitor cellhas resided in the shoot meristem; sectors that extend from the plant´s base to its tip indicate that a stem cell was marked. Such clonal analysis has been used to conclude that at least 3 to 4stem cells are present in each meristem layer that together form the central zone of the meristem (Stewart and Dermen, 1970). Maintenance of this stem cell pool in the central zone is Fig. 1. Divisional or invari- ant asymmetry.  The out- come of a stem cell division is controlled through signal ex- change between the stem cell and the surrounding niche cells. Stem cell daughters undergo several rounds of cell divisions as a trasit amplify- ing cell (TA cell) before differ- entiation. Stem cell promot- ing signals in yellow, feed- back signals in red.Plant stem cell niches    481 essential to allow indeterminate growth of the shoot apical meristem. Cell division rates, microsurgery and impermanence of the stem cell state  There is an obvious division of labour between the central zone harbouring stem cells and the peripheral zone as site oforgan initiation. This is also reflected in the cell division rates that vary vastly across the SAM surface. Live imaging of Arabidopsis shoot meristems revealed that rates are generally higher in theperipheral zone than in the centre. Cell cycle lengths range from 36-72 h in the central zone to 12-36 h in the peripheral zone and young organ primordia (Reddy  et al. , 2004). Thus, when a stem cell daughter leaves the central zone, it will soon change its behaviour and start to divide more rapidly, consistent with the concept of TA cells increasing the population size of stem celldescendants. In contrast to the root meristem, where a group of non-dividing cells constitute the quiescent centre (see below), all cells of the shoot meristem divide regularly. When and where acell divides appears to be influenced by its neighbours, since small groups of cells were found to divide coordinately within a short time window. This coordinated behaviour was observedamong cells within the same cell layer, but also between cells in adjacent layers that therefore belong to different clones (Reddy  et al., 2004). Laser induced cell ablation technology has offered a dramatic way of revealing such local interactions. For example, when the entire central zone of a tomato meristem was removed by laser pulses, a new central zone initiated from the peripheralzone within 4 days after the treatment (Reinhardt  et al. , 2003). This new zone harboured functional stem cells that were able to support further growth. In a normal (untreated) shoot meristem,neighbouring cells must then be inhibited from acquiring stem cell or niche fate by the presence of a functional central zone. The mechanism of this proposed inhibition is so far unknown. How-ever, the results from these precise cell ablation experiments highlight again two important facts about stem cell biology: (1) the current state of a cell (stem cell or non-stem cell) is not perma-nently fixed, but flexible; and (2), the stem cell state is controlled by interactions with the immediate cellular environment, the stem cell niche. Organisation of the stem cell niche  Longevity and continuous activity of the shoot meristem is only possible if a pool of stem cells is maintained that will replenish and restore the meristem cell pool, since cells are constantly lost from the meristem when organs are formed at the periphery. Shootmeristem stem cells were first identified as cells that divide infrequently and it was occasionally questioned that they divide at all. In the last 10 years, we have started to understand stem cellbehaviour in shoot meristems. Most of the information was collected from studies with  Arabidopsis , but related genes and mechanisms governing stem cell development have been identi-fied in other plants species such as maize. Stem cell number in the shoot apical meristem of  Arabidopsis   is controlled by (at least) two antagonistic pathways that promote or repress stem cellactivity, respectively. These two pathways involve the exchange of signals along the apical-basal axis of the plant; between stem cells at the meristem tip and a group of cells in the deeper L3 layerthat form the organizing centre (OC) (Figs. 3,4). A key element ofthe stem cell promoting pathway is the  WUSCHEL   (WUS ) gene, encoding a homeodomain transcription factor (Laux  et al. , 1996, Mayer  et al. , 1998). In the absence of WUS   function, meristems are initiated, but they fail to keep a sufficient number of stem cellsto maintain prolonged growth and development.  WUS   is first expressed at the 16-cell stage of embryogenesis in cells that will form the shoot meristem and later on, WUS   RNA is found only in the OC cells that lie underneath the stem cells. Therefore, WUS has to act non-cellautonomously to promote stem cell fate at themeristem tip. So far, there is no indication that the WUS proteinitself is moving out to adjacent cells (which has been observed for other plant transcription factors), but  WUS   may generate the signal that promotes stem cell identity in the neigbourhood. Whystem cell fate is only induced in the cells apical to the OC is not known. CLV signaling regulates WUS activity  Mutant hunts identified additional genes controlling stem cell fate. Mutations in one of the three  CLAVATA   genes ( CLV1,2   and 3) cause stem cell accumulation in shoot and floral meristems. clv mutant meristems maintain more stem cells in the central zonethan required to support normal meristem growth, resulting inenlarged meristems that occasionally lose any growth restriction and start to fasciate. This size increase of the central zone has also direct consequences for organ number: the peripheral zonethat surrounds the meristem centre enlarges correspondingly, allowing the formation of more organs. In normal development, the  CLV  genes act together and restrict stem proliferation. CLV1 encodes a receptor kinase, consisting of extracellular leucine- rich-repeats, a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic serine/ threonine kinase domain (Clark et al. , 1997). CLV1   is expressed in the meristem center, enclosing the domain of WUS   expression. The CLV2 protein is a LRR-receptor that lacks the kinase moiety (Jeong et al. , 1999) and CLV1 may form a heterodimeric receptor with CLV2 to form the core of a larger receptor complex (Trotochaud et al. , 1999). The size increase of clv1  mutant meristems shows that the CLV  signaling pathway restricts stem cell fate (or Fig. 2. Populational or environmental asymmetry.  Wether a stem cell division produces the same or different daughter cell types depends again on niche cells. Stem cells may divide asymmetrically to produce TA cells (bottom row) or give rise to new stem cells (top row). The differentiating cell population constantly signals back to the niche and stem cells to readjust the outcome of stem cell divisions.482    Y. Stahl and R. Simon teracted by a concomitant increase in CLV  signaling and WUS repression. This circuitry of stem cell regulation remains continously active. Shoot and floral meristems therefore use the strategy of populational asymmetry for stem cell deployment. The probabilityof a stem cell daughter to remain a stem cell then depends on its position in the meristem: a cell that is displaced laterally after a division will receive less (or no)  WUS   derived signal and adopt TA cell fate. Stem cell regulation beyond Arabidopsis  The components of the CLV /WUS   stem cell regulator appear to be used in many plant species. In petunia, TERMINATOR (TER) represents the orthologue to WUS   of Arabidopsis   and ter mutants terminate shoot meristem activity at early stages(Stuurman  et al. , 2002). Mutations in the FASCIATED EAR2 (FEA2 ) gene of maize cause a massive overproliferation of the inflorescence meristem; the FEA2 protein localises to the plasma membrane and shows high sequence similarity to CLV2 of Arabidopsis   (Taguchi-Shiobara et al. , 2001). In rice, a CLV1 orthologue has been identified as FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER1 (FON1 ). Mutations in fon1  cause proliferation of meristem cells and initiation of additional floral organs (Suzaki et al. , 2004). In contrast to CLV1   of Arabidopsis, which is expressed only in L3 layer, FON1   RNA is present throughout floral meristems. Finally,chimeras that were generated by grafting between wildtype and fasciated   (fas) mutant tomatoes had shown that meristem size in tomato (like in Arabidopsis ) is controlled from the L3 layer (Szymkowiak and Sussex, 1992). The gene product of the tomato FAS  gene is not yet known, but in analogy to Arabidopsis , it may encode a component of a CLV  signaling pathway that controls expression of a tomato WUS  -orthologue in the L3. Modulation of CLV signaling  The model for stem cell regulation in Arabidopsis   by CLV / WUS   allows to keep the number of CLV3 expressing stem cells proportional to the number of WUS   expressing cells underneath; however, it is not sufficient to account for homeostasis of absolute stem cell number. Obviously, meristem size may change duringdevelopment, although only within a narrow range. For example, a seasonal increase in organ production rates may require that more stem cells are maintained in the meristem. The activity of the CLV /WUS   stem cell regulator has to be flexible to allow for such moderate changes, but also robust enough to guarantee mainte- nance of an appropriate stem cell number during changingenvironmental conditions. Several factors have been identified that modulate  CLV  signal- ing: one negative regulator of CLV  signaling is KAPP, a protein phosphatase that interacts with a variety of receptor kinases Fig. 3. Origin and design of shoot and root meristems.  In early globular stage embryos, WUS expression is activated in the apical domain. Auxin shifts from the apical half to concentrate at the basal pole of the embryo, where PLT, SCR and SHR are activated. Stem cells in the shoot apical meristem (SAM) are induced by WUS at the meristem tip. The root meristem (RM) is patterned through the combined activities of auxin, auxin-dependent PLT expression, SHR and SCR.promotes differentiation), acting an- tagonistically to WUS . Indeed, WUS is expressed in a larger domain in clv mutants, indicating that WUS   is nega- tively regulated by the CLV  genes. The third CLAVATA   gene, CLV3 , encodes a small secreted protein thatis expressed only in stem cells (Brand et al. , 2000, Fletcher  et al. , 1999, Rojo et al. , 2002). Current evidence sup- ports a model whereby CLV3 is se- creted from stem cells and activates CLV1 signaling in cells underneath torepress  WUS   expression (Brand et al., 2000). Since CLV3 is expressed in the stem cells of the shoot system,it depends again on  WUS   expres- sion. This mutual regulation and inter- dependence between CLV3   and WUS can then establish a feedback regu- lated circuitry: if stem cell number increases, the amount of CLV3 pro-tein will increase correspondingly, causing a downregulation of  WUS   via CLV1 activation (Brand  et al. , 2000, Schoof  et al. , 2000) (Fig. 4A). This lowered amount of WUS (smaller stem cell niche) allows only fewer stemcells to be maintained. Fewer stem cells will provide a weaker negative feedback signal (CLV3), allowing WUS   expression to increase again. High WUS   expression (larger stem cell niche) will induce supernumerarystem cells, which will again be coun-Plant stem cell niches    483 (Stone  et al. , 1998, Williams  et al. , 1997). Another candidate regulator is the POLTERGEIST (POL) protein phosphatase 2C; pol  mutants have been identified as phenotypic suppressors of hypomorphic clv1  mutations, indicating that POL  activity inter- feres with CLV  signaling (Yu  et al. , 2003, Yu  et al. , 2000). Similar to KAPP , POL  is not only expressed in meristems but in many plant tissues, indicating that POL  may function in several signal transduction pathways (Interestingly, a recent analysis of the pol mutant phenotypes suggested that CLV  signaling may act upon additional, but as yet unidentified targets besides WUS  (Yu et al. , 2003)). Phosphatases like POL and KAPP could act to dampen any (accidental) dramatic increase in CLV  signaling that could switch off WUS   expression and cause a terminal loss of meristem stem cells. SHEPHERD   (SHD ) affects CLV  activity at a very different level (Ishiguro et al. , 2002). The SHD   gene encodes an ER-resident HSP90-like protein that is required for the properfolding of CLV proteins. Homozygous  shd  mutants form larger shoot and floral meristems, thus resembling clv  mutants, but they also show defects in root meristem organization and pollen tubegrowth. It is likely that SHD acts in the assembly of several receptor signaling complexes and does not have an exclusive role in the regulation of the  CLV  pathway. Specificity of the CLV signaling components  There are at least 610 receptor-like kinases encoded in the Arabidopsis genome, many of them showing high amino acid sequence similarity with CLV1 and some of the about 220 trans- membrane LRR receptors could have partially overlapping func-tions with CLV1 in meristem regulation. This is supported by the recent observation that all previously described  clv1  alleles that exhibit strong or intermediate phenotypes are dominant-negativealleles (Dievart  et al. , 2003); clv1  null alleles result in only weak phenotypes and are clearly distinguishable from null mutants in CLV3 . Thus, CLV3 may signal via CLV1 and additional related receptors that have not been identified so far. The mutant clv1 protein encoded by strong clv1  alleles is then predicted to bind to and inhibit the activation of these redundant receptors. The CLV2 protein is not necessarily involved in a specific interaction with the CLV3 ligand, but may rather promote thenotypes compared to clv1  or clv3  mutants, but show also defects in organ development such as pedicel elongation. Consistent with additional functions outside the meristem, CLV2   is expressed throughout the plant. CLV3   was first described as a unique sequence; meanwhile, more than 40 genes have been identified in the Arabidopsis and other plants´ genomes that encode CLV3-like (CLE) proteins(Cock and McCormick, 2001). The sequence similarities between them are confined to an N-terminal secretion signal and the CLE- motif, a short stretch of 14 amino acids near the C-terminus. Both clv3-1   and clv3-5   mutant alleles carry a point mutation in this region, indicating that the CLE motif is required for protein function (Fletcher et al. , 1999). Of the 25 Arabidopsis CLE -genes (including CLV3 ), 17 are expressed at detectable levels in the shoot apex (Sharma et al. , 2003). Although detailed studies have still to be perfomed, we can assume that several CLE proteins arealso expressed in the meristem, available for binding to the CLV receptor complex. Therefore, the recognition of CLV3 by CLV1 must be highly specific to avoid cross-signaling by other CLE-proteins; alternatively, a low binding specificity can be tolerated if only CLV3 is expressed at sufficient levels in the meristem to interact with CLV1. Indeed, misexpression of  CLE40   from the CLV3   promoter rescued the meristem defects of clv3  mutant plants, indicating that CLV3 is singular in its expression pattern, but not in its capacity to interact with CLV1 (Hobe et al. , 2003). We will give more attention to the roles of CLE proteins in the discussion on root stem cells. Is WUS sufficient to make stem cells?  The loss of stem cells in wus  mutants tells us that WUS   is required for stem cell maintenance. However, is WUS   expression alone also sufficient to induce stem cell fate in just any given cell? This has been tested by misexpressing WUS   using a variety of different promoters. WUS   was shown to induce the expression of the stem cell marker CLV3   even in differentiating organs (Schoof et al. , 2000), sugesting that WUS   alone can induce stem cells. However, not all cells were able to respond to increased WUS activity, indicating that a specific cellular competence (or addi- tional signals from the microenvironment) is required. For ex- Fig. 4. Possible CLV signaling pathways in shoot and root meristems.  (A) In shoot and floral meristems, WUS acts from the organising centre (OC) to induce CLV3-expressing stem cells in the central zone. The stem cell population signals back via the CLV pathway to restrict WUS expression. (B) In the root, quiescent centre (QC) cells signal (red arrow) to adjacent cells to maintain their status as initials. A WUS-related gene (WOX5) is expressed in the QC and could be involved in this signaling process. Activation of CLE expression promotes early differentiation of TA cells, possibly via a CLV-like signal transduction pathway.stability of the CLV1 receptor kinase within the complex. Stem cells accu- mulate in clv2  mutants because the amount of CLV1 receptor available for signal transmission is reduced. However, the clv2  floral phenotype is suppressed when plants are grown under short day conditions, i.e. CLV2 is only required under long days.This could suggest that other recep- tor proteins can substitute for CLV2 under certain conditions (Jeong  et al., 1999, Kayes and Clark, 1998). Jeong et al.  proposed that long pho- toperiod repress the activation of anunknown receptor kinase that acts independently of the  CLV  pathway to restrict WUS   activity (Jeong and Clark, 2004). All clv2  mutants dis- play relatively weak meristem phe- A B484    Y. Stahl and R. Simon ample, WUS   expression in leaves was reported to activate CLV3 expression only in (adaxial) leaf axils (Brand et al. , 2002) or in the vasculature (Lenhard et al. , 2002), but not in all leaf cells. The adaxial sides of the leaf base are regions that can give rise to newaxillary meristems later in development and the vasculature contains its own meristematic cells that may be responsive to ectopic  WUS   activity. Interestingly, high level WUS   expression in roots was reported to cause the de-novo formation of embryos from root cells, suggesting that WUS   may have additional and previously unsuspected roles in embryogenesis (Zuo et al., 2002). Alternatively, the root context could affect the interpretation of the WUS   signal. Gallois and colleagues further refined these experi- ments by using a heat-shock inducible recombination system toactivate high-level  WUS   expression in random root cells (Gallois et al. , 2004). WUS   expression in the root tips was able to activate the CLV3 (shoot) stem cell marker within 3 days after induction.Like in the shoot meristem,  CLV3   and WUS   were not expressed in the same, but mostly in adjacent cells. In the following weeks, these root tips formed green leaf tissue, indicating that root cellscan be reprogrammed to shoot stem cell identity and that  WUS expression can trigger this transformation. However, in combina-tion with external auxin,  WUS   expressing root tips generated entire embryos and together with the floral regulatory protein LEAFY, flower organs were initiated. Thus, the specific response of a cell to WUS   is dependent on the environment. Such a context dependent interpretation of the WUS   signal is also seen during flower development. In floral meristems, WUS   activates expres- sion of the homeotic gene AGAMOUS   (AG, discussed below) (Lenhard  et al. , 2001, Lohmann  et al. , 2001). Later in ovule development, WUS   is expressed in the nucellus and promotes the initiation of the integuments from the chalazal region (Gross-Hardt  et al. , 2002). Taken together, WUS   does not appear to provide a signal that is specific for the generation of only stem cells. Instead, the specific response of a cell to a WUS   derived signal may depend entirely on a cell´s microenvironment or developmental history. There are several WUS  -related genes encoded in the Arabidopsis   genome that play a role in embryonic pattern formation, development of the lateral axis and possibly specification of the root meristem´s quiescent centre (Haecker  et al., 2004, Matsumoto and Okada, 2001). The WUS   gene family, together with their immediate target genes, could form signaling modules that are used repeatedly during plant development to mediate communication and coordinated growth between adja-cent cell groups. Terminating stem cells in flower meristems  In floral meristems, stem cells are maintained only for a limited period, i.e. as long as new organs are formed. They are then consumed during the production of the innermost floral organs,the carpels. Like in the shoot meristem, the  CLV /WUS   circuitry controls stem cell fate also in flowers: wus  mutant flowers form fewer stamens and lack the central carpels, indicating that stemcells were consumed prematurely;  clv  mutants accumulate stem cells in floral meristems that are then used to form additional carpels or even extra floral whorls, resulting in a misshapen, club-like gynoecium (hence the name  CLAVATA , derived from clava (lat.) = club). However, there are also other regulators actingexclusively in floral meristems. One of them is  AGAMOUS   (AG), encoding a MADS box transcription factor that controls theproduction of stamens and carpels in the inner two flower whorls (Yanofsky et al. , 1990). The floral meristems of ag  mutants become indeterminate, implicating AG  in the restriction of stem cell number. In wildtype floral meristems, WUS   expression is lost around floral stage 6, but WUS   remains expressed in ag  mutant flowers beyond that stage (Lenhard  et al. , 2001, Lohmann  et al. , 2001). Furthermore, WUS   activity is required for the indetermi- nacy of ag  mutant flowers, indicated by the lack of floral organ proliferation in ag/wus   double mutants (Laux et al. , 1996). Thus, AG  appears to control meristem stem cell proliferation by nega- tively regulating WUS   expression. How AG  performs this function is still unknown; however, it appears that AG  acts independently of the CLV  genes, since floral meristem indeterminacy is further enhanced in ag/clv   double mutants and the WUS   expression domain expands further in ag/clv   mutant meristems compared to those of ag  or clv  single mutants (Lohmann et al. , 2001). This role of AG  in the control of meristem determinacy is restricted to flowers. In the shoot meristem, AG  expression is not activated. One important factor that distinguishes floral mer-istems from shoot meristems is the expression of LFY protein. LFY is a transcription factor that can convert shoot to flower meristems by activating a set of flower specific regulator genes(Parcy  et al. , 1998, Weigel  et al. , 1992). Activation of AG  in the centre of floral meristems is controlled by the combined activities of LFY, which is expressed throughout floral meristems and WUS . First evidence for this role of WUS   in the activation of a floral homeotic regulator gene came from misexpression experiments, where WUS   transcription was controlled from promoters that direct organ specific gene expression in flowers (Lenhard  et al. , 2001, Lohmann  et al. , 2001). For example, expression of WUS from the AP3  promoter (in the presumptive second and third floral whorl) resulted in the production of extra floral organs that developed into carpelloid stamens – both organ types require AG activity. Indeed, increased WUS   expression caused proliferation of meristem cells and ectopic activation of AG  expression. A more detailed analysis at the molecular level then showed that the WUS protein can bind specific DNA target sequences of the AG regulatory regions that are located immediately adjacent to the binding sites for the LFY protein (Lohmann et al. , 2001). Both proteins can act independently to activate AG  expression in a yeast assay system. However, since AG  is normally only ex- pressed in the centre of floral meristems, both LFY  and WUS appear to be required for normal levels of AG  transcription. From stage 3 until stage 6, both AG  and WUS   are expressed in an overlapping set of cells, indicating that AG  expression per se is not sufficient to downregulate WUS   transcription. Further- more, ectopic expression of AG  throughout the plant causes early flowering and homeotic organ transformations, but does not terminate shoot meristem development (Mizukami and Ma, 1992).This indicates that either  AG  expression levels have to reach a certain threshold level, or accumulation of additional and so far unidentified factors is required to cooperate with AG  in the regulation of WUS   and consequently meristem determinacy. The precise timepoint during development that this happens may be of great importance, since a premature loss of stem cells couldresult in sterile flowers if carpels are not formed. We may therefore expect that  AG  activity is tightly controlled and possibly at several levels. Indeed, in addition to positive and negative regulation of AG  transcription, there is also posttranscriptional control of AGPlant stem cell niches    485 newly arising organs and the meristem. In han mutants, both WUS   and the stem cell marker CLV3   are expressed in more diffuse domains and meristem size decreases. (Zhao et al. , 2004). han/clv   double mutants show increased fasciation (cell proliferation in the meristem)compared to  clv  single mutants, indicating that these gens act in separate pathways to regulate WUS . Interestingly, increased expression of HAN   causes growth retardation and severly affects meristem shape and function, indicating that HAN   controls cell proliferation and differ- entiation. HAN   expression partially overlaps during early embryogenesis with WUS   expres- sion, but not during later shoot and floral mer-istem development, when  HAN   RNA is found only in meristem-organ boundaries. At these stages, HAN   could act only indirectly to pro- duce a signal that controls either division of WUS  -expressing cells, or WUS   expression levels in the central meristem domain. Thisvariability of shoot meristem size and activity in han  mutant or overexpressing plants suggests that a HAN   dependent mechanisms acts in the wildtype, stabilizing meristem size during de- velopment. During normal development, the requirements for cell production from the mer- Fig. 5. Organisation of the root meristem.activity. Several of the factors involved were first identified throughsensitized genetic screens, i.e. by searching for extragenic muta- tions that enhance the meristem indeterminacy phenotype of a weak  ag  mutant (Chen and Meyerowitz, 1999). At least 4 genes (HUA1   and 2, HEN2   and 4) have so far been shown to affect the generation of functional AG  mRNA (Chen  et al. , 2002, Cheng  et al., 2003, Li  et al. , 2001, Western  et al. , 2002). At the molecular level, HUA1 ,2  and HEN4   seem to promote the processing of (or inhibit aberrant polyadenylation within) the unusually large sec- ond intron of AG. Interestingly, it is this second intron which also contains the key sequences for both positive and negative regu- lation of AG  transcription (Busch  et al. , 1999, Sieburth and Meyerowitz, 1997). An additional member of the AG  dependent floral termination pathway, HEN3 , was recently shown to encode a cyclin dependent kinase. Repression of WUS   at later stages of flower development is alleviated in hen3   mutants, providing a potential link between stem cell maintenance and cellular prolif- eration (Wang and Chen, 2004). From what we have discussed so far, a picture of stem cell control in meristem emerges: When meristems are first formed, WUS   is activated in a small set of cells and signals to specifiy stem cells at the meristem tip. These stem cells in turn expressCLV3, which acts via the CLV1/2 receptor complex to restrict WUS   expression. After floral induction, floral meristems are formed at the flanks of the shoot apical meristem that express theLFY transcription factor. The combined activity of LFY and WUS induces transcription of  AG  in the central zone of the floral meristems. AG now acts at two levels: it specifies the productionof stamens and carpels, in combination with several other genes and switches off  WUS   expression. Thus, WUS   is controlled by two and probably independently acting feedback regulated sys-tems. The determinate state of floral meristems, with a completeloss of stem cells, requires the combined activities of both sys- tems, since mutations in either the  CLV  genes or AG  result in indeterminacy. However, to be a floral meristem is not necessarily the end of it all: occasionally, floral meristems may switch back to an inde- terminate state and restart as a shoot meristem. In Arabidopsis , this process called floral reversion can be induced by manipulat-ing the flower-inducing photoperiodic stimulus, or by reducing LFY  or AG  activity. When plants heterozygous for a lfy  mutation are cultivated under short-day conditions, flowers can revert evenafter carpel formation and grow a new shoot from gynoecium cells that express  AG  (Okamuro et al. , 1996). This indicates that even high levels of AG  expression in the meristem centre are not sufficient for a permanent repression of stem cell fate. Mainte- nance of the determinate floral state may require not only down- regulation of WUS   via AG  and the CLV  genes, but also repression of other, shoot meristem specific genes. Indeed, it has been proposed that LFY  has a dual function in activating flower specific, but repressing shoot specific gene expression (Okamuro et al. , 1996, Parcy  et al. , 2002). Integration of meristem activity: new genes and mutants  We have so far just begun to understand how the control of stem cell number is integrated with the overall growth and devel- opment of the shoot system and with the formation of organs.Genetic screens for mutants that are affected in meristem main- tenance continue to reveal new gene functions that have to be incorporated into the existing regulatory networks. Some of them,like  HANABA TARANU   (HAN ) gene of Arabidopsis , are required to initiate and maintain the precise expression pattern of WUS . HAN  encodes a GATA-3-like transcription factor that is ex- pressed at the boundaries between floral whorls and between486    Y. Stahl and R. Simon istem may change during growth phases and a HAN   controlled pathway, acting from the meristem-organ interface, could coordi- nate meristem size with the rate of organ production. HAIRY MERISTEM   (ham) mutants of petunia fail to maintain a shoot meristem, similar to ter  mutants ( TER  is a homologue of WUS ) (Stuurman et al. , 2002). ham/ter   double mutants display additive effects, indicating that these genes act in parallel path-ways. The  HAM   gene encodes a transcription factor of the GRAS family that is expressed in the provasculature of the stem and developing organs. Other GRAS   genes have been shown to be involved in root cell type specification and stem cell maintenance (see below), but also in mediating gibberellic acid signaling. The exact mode of action of HAM   is unknown, but its mutant pheno- type together with its expression pattern indicates that HAM   acts non-cellautonomously in a novel pathway that links stem cell perpetuation in meristems with the generation of differentiatedcell types at the periphery. Similar to  ham  mutants of petunia, the shoot meristems of Arabidopsis  Dornröschen   (drn-D ) mutants terminate prema- turely. The affected gene, DRN/ESR1 , encodes an AP2/ERF type transcription factor that is misexpressed in drn-D   mutants, resulting in altered regulation of CLV3 , WUS , STM   and possibly other target genes (Kirch et al. , 2003). Interestingly, DRN/ESR1 is normally transcribed in the central zone of shoot and floralmeristems and in the anlagen of lateral organs, where expressionis maintained for a short period at the tip of the primordium. For example,  DRN/ESR1   is expressed in single epidermal cells of the ovule anlagen and remains expressed in the most apical cell ofthe growing ovule. The common theme underlying the spatial distribution of  DRN/ESR1   mRNA may be “apical position” for all meristems and organs. Cellular differentiation of lateral organsstarts from the organ tip and may be promoted by  DRN   expres- sion at this position. DRN   expression in the central zone of meristems would then counteract or balance stem cell promotingsignals by fostering the exit of stem cells to the TA cell fate. III. Deconstructing plant stem cell niches: root mer- istems Organisation of the Arabidopsis root  The Arabidopsis   root comprises a rather simple structure of concentrically organised cell layers forming (from the outside to the inside) epidermis, cortex, endodermis, pericycle and vascula-ture. Cortex and endodermis together are called the ground tissue and vasculature and pericycle jointly form the stele. The overall root structure can be divided into distinct zones, representing itsdifferent developmental stages. The meristematic zone at the root tip contains stem cells that generate all the tissues of the root. This is followed by the elongation zone where the cells undergoregulated elongation and finally the differentiation zone where cells acquire their individual fate. In this region, root hairs appear as an indicator of differentiation (Dolan  et al. , 1993). The stem cells of the root meristem (also called “initials”) give rise to all the cell types in each layer by stereotyped divisions, thereby produc- ing clonally related files of cells (Fig. 5). The division of initials caneither be merely anticlinal (like in the columella initials, forming only one cell file or layer) or first anticlinal and then periclinal (in all other initials, e.g. endodermis/cortex initials, forming two ormore cell layers) (Dolan  et al. , 1993). After the initial cell divides,one of the two daughter cells remains an initial cell, whereas the other cell becomes a transit-amplifying cell (TA cell) and after a number of divisions differentiates and acquires its specific fate. The initials surround four mitotically inactive cells called thequiescent centre (QC) that act as a stem cell organizer (Dolan  et al., 1993). QC and initial cells together constitute the stem cell niche of the Arabidopsis   root. The QC is established in the octant stage of embryogenesis from a single cell, the hypophysis (Scheres et al. , 1994). After the hypophysis divides, the upper lens-shaped cell gives rise to the QC, whereas the lower daughter cell be-comes the central root cap. Communication in the root stem cell niche  Root meristem cells show rigid clonal relationships and both QC, initial cells and their descendants can be easily identified by their position. However, similar to the situation in the shoot stemcell system, the fate of a given cell in the root is not permanently fixed, but depends on signals from its neighbours. This was elegantly revealed by laser ablation of individual QC cells orinitials in the  Arabidopsis   root meristem, showing that these cells can be replaced by their neighbours, which then acquire the appropriate identity (van den Berg et al. , 1995) (Fig. 4B). Further- more, differentiated cells (or TA cells?) appear to signal back to their initials and direct their fate. However, when individual QC cells were ablated, only those initial cells in direct contact to theablated QC cell lost their stem cell character and started to differentiate (or behaved like their daughter cells) (van den Berg et al. , 1997). Noteworthy, this initiation of differentiation did not require an intermediate round of cell divisions. This implies that the QC is a source of a short-range, non-cell autonomous signal, which prevents the differentiation of the surrounding initial cellsand thereby maintains their stem cell character. The nature of this signal is not yet known. The role of the initial cells of the root is equivalent to the role of the  CLV3  -expressing stem cells in the shoot meristem and QC cells have a role similar to that of the WUS  -expressing OC cells. However, stem cell fate in the shoot is controlled at the level of cellpopulations (populational asymmetry), whereas root stem cells seem to be controlled individually by a short-range signal from the QC (individual asymmetry). A CLV-like pathway acting in the root?  Several observations indicate that a  CLV -like signaling path- way may also act to control stem cell fate in the root. Overexpres- sion of three different members of the CLE-protein family (CLV3, CLE19 and CLE40) in the root caused a progressive reduction ofroot meristem activity, leading to growth termination (Casamitjana- Martinez  et al. , 2003, Hobe  et al. , 2003). These root defects are not due to a misspecification of the QC or a loss of initials, but tofewer cell divisions (premature differentation) of their immediate descendants (the TA cells), which is indicated by the formation of differentiated cell types such as root hairs close to the meristemtip. Similar to the  CLV  signaling pathway in the shoot that regulates the activity of the stem cell population, this CLE  signal- ing pathway in the root also controls the size of a cell population,but not stem cell fate which is regulated at the individual cell level in the root (Fig. 4B). To identify components of  CLE  signaling pathways in the root, Casamitjana-Martinez and colleaguesscreened for  suppressors of LLP1/CLE   (SOL) overexpressionPlant stem cell niches    487 and found that CLE  signaling requires the activity of SOL1 . The SOL1 protein resembles Zn2+-carboxypeptidases and could pro- cess CLE proteins into an active form. No root specific receptor protein for CLE has been found to date, but in both rice and Arabidopsis , homeobox genes closely related to WUS   were shown to be expressed specifically in the QC (Haecker  et al. , 2004, Kamiya  et al. , 2003). Positioning the root stem cell niche  The root stem cell niche is laid out during early embryogen- esis. One of the most important factors that pattern the early embryo is the phytohormone auxin. Auxin is transported in a polar fashion and auxin carrier or response mutants display root pat-terning defects. In the developing globular embryo, auxin be- comes redistributed through the activity of PIN proteins and accumulates in the basal half of the embryo, where root stem cellsare specified (the role of auxin in embryogenesis will be discussed in detail in another article in this issue) (Fig. 3). Auxin acts through a class of transcription factors (auxin response factors, or ARF)such as MONOPTEROS (MP) that interact directly with promoter elements of auxin inducible genes.  mp  mutants fail to produce the hypophysis and do not develop root tissue (Hardtke and Berleth,1998). The auxin response maximum in the developing root, monitored using a synthetic auxin-responsive promoter driving the  GUS   reporter gene (Sabatini et al., 1999), is found at the distal root tip. Exogenous application of auxin, or shifting the auxin maximum using transport inhibitors can induce the formation of ectopic QC and stem cells, consistent with auxin positioning thestem cell niche in the root. However, the transcription factors that act downstream of auxin signal transduction were unknown. Aida and colleagues have now shown that auxin inducible expressionof the  PLETHORA   (PLT1   and 2) genes of Arabidopsis , encoding AP2 type transcription factors, is required for QC specification and stem cell activity. The expression patterns of PLT1   and 2, first in the basal region of the early embryo and later in the distal root meristem, overlap with the auxin maxima and identify the root stem cell niche. Double mutants of plt1  and plt2  suffer from a (not understood) size reduction of cortex cells, but more importantly, they appear to lack a functional QC and show differentiation of stem cells (Aida et al. , 2004). But are PLT1   and 2  sufficient to induce stem cell fate? Misexpression of PLT  genes induce all cell identities that are derived from the basal part of the embryo, such as hypocotyl and root. Some transgenic seedlings appeared toconsist entirely of root cell types, including the shedding and starch-granule containing columella cells of the distal root tip. Most importantly, QC marker genes were activated at new posi-tions without a prior accumulation of auxin at these sites, suggest- ing that once activated by auxin response factors like MP, the  PLT genes can act independently to establish root meristem cell fates. Besides the PLT  pathway, two members of the GRAS gene family, SHORTROOT   (SHR ) and SCARECROW   (SCR ), are required for QC specification and stem cell sustainment in theroot.  SHR   RNA is made in the provascular tissue, but SHR protein moves out to the adjacent cells (endodermis and QC) where it enters the nucleus to activate SCR   transcription. SCR in turn appears to inhibit SHR from moving further outwards to adjacent layers (Heidstra et al. , 2004). SCR   expression in the QC is required for QC identity, so SCR   can act only cell-autonomously. However, expression of SCR   in the QC region could not rescuethe root meristem defects of shr  mutant seedlings, indicating that the role of SHR   is not limited to SCR   activation and that presence of both SHR and SCR protein in the QC is required to maintain it (Sabatini et al. , 2003). Both proteins are also expressed in the entire endodermal cell layer (Helariutta  et al. , 2000, Nakajima  et al., 2001) and exogenous auxin can transform these cells into QC with adjacent stem cells. From these data, Aida and colleagues have proposed a model for patterning the root stem cell niche: First, auxin accumulation at the basal end of the embryo activates ARFs  such as MP, which upregulate PLT expression. Then, SHR accumulates in provas- cular cells and promotes SCR   expression in the adjacent cell layer and the combined activities of PLT, SCR and SHR specifythe QC cells. Finally, cells surrounding the QC that also express PLT (but not SCR or SHR) acquire stem cell identity in response to (so far unknown) short range signals from the QC (Aida  et al. , 2004).

However, the combined action of diverse organisms and their different metabolites on plant healthhas yet to be fully appreciated. Here, the multifactorial nature of these interactions, at the organismal andmolecular level, leading to the biological control of plant diseases is reviewed. To do so, we describe in detailthe ecological signiﬁcance of three different classes of secondary metabolites and discuss how they mightcontribute to biological control. Speciﬁcally, the roles of auxin, acetoin, and phenazines are considered,because they represent very different but important types of secondary metabolites. We also describe howstudies of the global regulation of bacterial secondary metabolism have led to the discovery of new genes andphenotypes related to plant health promotion. In conclusion, we describe three avenues for future research thatwill help to integrate these complex and diverse observations into a more coherent synthesis of bacteriallymediated biocontrol of plant diseases. Diverse plant-associated bacteria can positively impact plant health and physiology in a variety of ways (19). Three well-studied mechanisms of biological disease control and planthealth promotion conferred by plant-associated bacteria haverecently been reviewed (38). However, the focus on identifyingand characterizing individual mechanisms has obscured thecomplex, multifactorial nature of biological control. So, whilemany different biocontrol bacteria have been identiﬁed andmuch has been learned about different types of plant-bacte-rium interactions for some of these populations, we are justbeginning to appreciate the number and complexity of inter-actions actually taking place in situ . Indeed, many different bacteria and many different bacterial metabolites have beenidentiﬁed as important contributors to the biological control ofplant diseases. However, we still lack a clear understandingof how the populations and activities of the diverse populationsof microorganisms that colonize every plant are connected andintegrated in natural and agricultural environments. Here, we review recent work that indicates the multifactorial nature of biocontrol (Fig. 1). Speciﬁcally, we review a numberof the studies indicating that biocontrol arises from the com-bined actions of multiple bacterial populations, each express-ing several different classes of bioactive metabolites under thecontrol of multiple genes and regulons. And we highlight re-cent work in the authors’ laboratories that begins to identifythe diverse factors contributing to changes in plant growth andhealth status. We conclude by providing a road map for future research that will lead to a greater understanding of the com-plex, dynamic, and multifactorial nature of biological controlphenotypes expressed by plant-associated bacteria. THE DIVERSITY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY OF BIOCONTROL BACTERIA It is well established that there are large and diverse num- bers of bacteria found on plants, and a diverse set of bacteriahave been identiﬁed with biocontrol activities (19). To date,isolates of over two dozen genera of bacteria have been re-ported to have biocontrol and/or plant growth-promoting ac-tivities (61), and new genera and species of biocontrol bacteriaare still being discovered (3) (B. B. McSpadden Gardener,unpublished data). Furthermore, among some bacterial gen-era, multiple species and subspecies of biocontrol agents havebeen identiﬁed and can be found across multiple spatial scales,from the global to the farm level, and even on single plants.Interestingly, individual isolates may display biocontrol activitynot only on the crops from which they were obtained but alsoon other crops (18). This may reﬂect the generalist nature ofsome genotypes, especially those with a wide geographic dis-tribution (48). Clearly, if introduced in sufﬁcient numbers andactive for a sufﬁcient duration, a single bacterial populationcan have a signiﬁcant impact on plant health. However, suchactive strains do not act alone in a vacuum. Rather, they existamong a diversity of other bacteria which may also contributeto or antagonize biocontrol. For example, one class of biocon-trol pseudomonads found to suppress the take-all pathogen(73) were found to coexist in the rhizosphere with other bac-teria, including other Pseudomonas antagonists and * Corresponding author.

Chryseobacterium agonists, whose populations all changed in response to pathogen infection (47). That multiple populationsof biocontrol bacteria can contribute additively and sometimesinterfere with one another when applied in mixtures (18, 38)further supports the conclusion that multiple bacterial popu-lations can and do contribute to biocontrol in situ . PHYTOHORMONE PRODUCTION AND CATABOLISM BY PLANT-ASSOCIATED BACTERIA The production of plant hormones is a characteristic of many plant-associated microorganisms. For all ﬁve classicalphytohormones, i.e., auxin, ethylene (ET), abscisic acid, cyto-kinin, and gibberellin, synthesis as a secondary metabolite hasbeen demonstrated for at least one bacterial and/or fungal species (16). Some microorganisms can also produce second-ary metabolites that affect phytohormone production in plants(6). Plant hormones govern growth of the plant through spatialand temporal control over cell elongation, division, and differ-entiation. They also play a key role in a plant’s response tobiotic and abiotic stresses. Given the capacity to contribute totheir host’s hormone pool, plant-associated microorganismshave the potential to manipulate plant physiology and steer ittoward outcomes that favor their own survival. Probably the best-known hormone-related activity among plant-associated microorganisms is the production of the auxinindole acetic acid (IAA). Plant-associated IAA producers in-clude many species of bacteria, as well as fungi and yeasts (12).Some are plant pathogens and others are beneﬁcials; however,for many no effect on plant health has been demonstrated. Themicrobial genes underlying IAA production are well charac-terized, as are the various biosynthetic pathways (66). Theamounts of IAA produced in vitro by bacteria and other mi- croorganisms can be quite substantial, with concentrations se-creted into the medium in the nano- to millimolar range. Onlyfor a few microbial IAA producers has in vivo production of IAA been demonstrated to impact bacterial survival and/orplant growth. For example, wild-type Erwinia herbicola 299R outcompeted an isogenic ipdC mutant, which is unable to pro- duce IAA, on bean leaf surfaces, while it also was shown tostimulate radish root elongation more than the same mutant(5). Similarly, in a canola seedling assay, wild-type Pseudomo- nas putida GR12-2 caused primary roots to be up to 50% longer than an IAA-deﬁcient mutant (53). These results dem-onstrate that the ability to produce IAA can affect both bac-terial survival and plant growth, and future studies will need toreveal whether there is a correlation between the two. Plants can harbor high numbers of IAA-producing microbes on their above- and below-ground parts (70, 71). For example,up to 60% of all bacteria that were cultured from leaves ofﬁeld-grown lettuce were capable of IAA production in vitro (J. Leveau, unpublished data). Identiﬁcation by 16S rRNA genesequencing of a subset of these lettuce isolates revealed thatthey belong to genera such as Erwinia ,Pantoea , and Pseudo- monas , which were among the most abundant on these leaves (Leveau, unpublished). This high proportion of bacterial IAAproducers suggests that IAA synthesis might be a property thatis selected for, in the sense that it contributes to survival in theplant environment. Some data exist in support of this claim,e.g., IAA mutants of Erwinia herbicola (5, 41) and Pseudomo- nas savastanoi (66) showed reduced population sizes on plant leaf surfaces. The mechanism by which IAA production aids inbacterial survival remains unclear. It may be that some bacteriacan trick the plant into redirecting the ﬂow of nutrients (in-cluding photosynthates such as sucrose, fructose, and glucose)toward the bacterial site of colonization. Another proposedmechanism by which IAA production aids bacterial survival isthe IAA-induced release of saccharides from the plant cell wall(37). It was suggested recently that microbially produced IAA not only serves to manipulate host physiology but also acts as abacterial signal (66). Most remarkable in this context is thestimulation by IAA of its own synthesis in plant growth-pro-moting Azospirillum species, analogous to a quorum sensing FIG. 1. The multifactorial nature of biological control of plant dis- eases. (1) Cellular expression of biocontrol-related genes and secretionof bioactive metabolites. Production of bioactive metabolites occurswithin the complex network of cellular metabolism, which is inﬂuencedby internal regulons as well as external signals. The diversity of thesegenes, metabolites, and networks has not been fully elucidated. (2)Distribution and dynamics of plant-associated microbial populationswith biocontrol capacities. Subsets of these populations may act toalter plant health status across a complex mosaic of aggregates andbioﬁlms found on all host tissues. Such assemblages may contain bio-control (beige ovals) and/or pathogenic bacteria (yellow ovals), but thedistribution, diversity, and dynamics of such populations are not fullycharacterized. (3) Host responses to microbial activities integratedthrough the symplast at the cell, organ, and whole-plant levels. Thestimulus from multiple contact points between plant hosts and diversemicrobial epiphytes and endophytes certainly occurs and can affect thepartitioning of nutrients and the development of phenotypes indicatingplant health status. However, how such multiple signals are processedand integrated locally and systemically remains a mystery.V OL. 77, 2011 MINIREVIEWS 1549 Downloaded from https://journals.asm.org/journal/aem on 08 February 2024 by 14.139.226.226. (QS) or autoactivation mechanism. This hypothesis puts the spotlight on another set of plant-associated bacteria, namely,those that can actively destroy IAA. Such bacteria also can bequite common on plant surfaces (35). Some, like Pseudomonas putida strain 1290, can use IAA as a sole source of carbon, nitrogen, and energy. Others partially degrade IAA but wouldbe equally able to disrupt IAA-based signaling. Interestingly,some degradation products of IAA are in turn signal molecules(16). For example, salicylate is a plant hormone involved in theplant response to pathogens, and isatin has a demonstratedsignaling function in bacterial bioﬁlm formation; yet, both canbe derived from the degradation of IAA. Further research into the role of microbial IAA as a manip- ulative and/or signaling molecule will likely beneﬁt from toolsthat allow us to demonstrate and quantify the availability ofIAA in vivo and at scales that are most relevant to microbes. For this, bioreporter technology (34) holds considerable prom-ise. Because of the known responsiveness of certain gene pro-moters to chemical or other stimuli, the speciﬁcities of suchpromoters allow bacteria (or other microorganisms) to reporton the exposure to a speciﬁc stimulus through the synthesis ofan easily detectable reporter protein, such as green ﬂuorescentprotein (GFP). An exciting source for promoters that respondto IAA is those bacteria that carry the newly identiﬁed IAAcatabolism ( iac) genes (33). In Pseudomonas putida strain 1290, these genes code for the destruction of IAA and areinduced speciﬁcally in response to IAA, making them excellentcandidates for bioreporter purposes. It is expected that biore-porters such as these, in parallel with plant-based reporterconstructs for IAA, will be important assets in the gathering ofinformation on the spatial and temporal variation of IAA avail-ability in plant environments, on the ecology of plant-associ-ated microorganisms that produce and degrade IAA, and onthe direct and indirect impact of these microbial interactionson plant health. PRODUCTION AND EFFECTS OF BACTERIAL VOLATILES Analogous to the role of volatiles in insect resistance (23), volatile organic compounds (VOCs) play a signiﬁcant role inthe induction of plant host resistance. Ryu et al. (63, 64)observed that both Bacillus subtilis strain GB03 and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain IN937a produced volatiles that signif- icantly reduced the severity of disease on Arabidopsis thaliana caused by Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum (formerly known as Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora ). Fur- ther study of these VOCs identiﬁed 2,3-butanediol and 3-hy-droxy-2-butanone (also referred to as acetoin) as elicitors ofinduced systemic resistance (ISR) in A. thaliana against P. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum . Bacterial VOCs were shown to elicit ISR in several Arabidopsis mutants, including a jas- monic acid-insensitive line ( coi1 mutant), an ethylene-insensi- tive line ( ein2 mutant), a salicylic acid (SA)-degrading trans- genic line ( nahG mutant), and a nonexpressor of PR proteins (npr1 mutant). VOCs from strain IN937a elicited ISR on all of these lines, whereas VOCs from strain GB03 failed to elicitISR on ein2 mutant plants. The importance of the ethylene- dependent signaling pathway for elicitation of ISR by VOCsfrom strain GB03 was conﬁrmed in tests using GUS fusions tothe PDF1.2 gene, which is an indicator for the ethylene re- sponse. Recently, the relationship between ethylene signal- ing and bacterial VOC-elicited ISR was further substanti-ated by proteomic analysis that demonstrated signiﬁcantupregulation of three major ethylene biosynthesis proteins(i.e., aspartate aminotransferase, S-adenosylmethionine synthetase 2, and methionine adenosyltransferase 3) follow-ing bacterial VOC treatment (31). At low doses, the biological activity of 2,3-butanediol in Arabidopsis thaliana is to activate ISR. The priming activity of 2,3-butanediol to reduce a plant’s susceptibility to disease wasconﬁrmed using Bacillus sp. strains that were altered to no longer produce this VOC (63). In a separate study, Han andcolleagues reported that the application of 2,3-butanediol didnot increase ISR against Pseudomonas syringae pv.tabaci but did induce ISR against P. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum (21). These results were consistent with previous work showinginduction of an ethylene (ET)-responsive PDF1.2 gene by bac-terial VOC exposure. An ET-dependent plant defense signal-ing pathway could be more effective against a necrotrophicpathogen like P. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum than P. syrin- gae, which requires a salicylic acid (SA)-dependent resistance response (58). In addition, 2,3-butanediol and acetoin pro-duced by Bacillus subtilis strain FB17 can induce ISR against P. syringae pv.tomato DC3000 (62). Further analysis of Arabidop- sismutants and transcriptional proﬁles suggests that acetoin- elicited ISR is dependent on SA and ET signaling pathways.Collectively, bacterial production of two major volatiles, i.e.,2,3-butanediol and acetoin, orchestrated SA and ET signalingto protect plants against two different types of pathogens, i.e.,necrotrophs and biotrophs. Importantly, VOCs, such as those shown above to contribute to biological control, are actually produced by diverse soilbacteria. In fact, most species of Proteobacteria and Firmicutes groups produce 2,3-butanediol and acetoin under low oxygenconcentrations to provide an alternative electron sink for theregeneration of NAD /H11001when aerobic respiration is limited (75). The comprehensive chemical proﬁle of bacterial volatiles indicate that a mixture of more than 30 different compoundswas emitted from culture of Bacillu s spp., based on headspace solid phase microextraction coupled with software extractionof overlapping GC-separated components (15). Further inves-tigation will be needed to see what other, and potentially moreeffective, ISR triggering molecules, besides 2,3-butanediol andacetoin, can be found in this mixture. Recent studies have shown that different plant growth-pro- moting rhizobacteria (PGPR) can elicit so-called “induced sys-temic tolerance” to abiotic stresses, such as salt and drought(76) and acid soil stress (59). What role might volatiles play inthese phenomena related to plant health? Two recent studiesdemonstrated that bacterial volatiles conferred resistance tosalt and drought (11, 77). Despite their volatile nature, suchmolecules may be applied practically, because many VOCs,such as 2,3-butanediol, are water soluble, inexpensive ( /H11021$1/ kg), work at extremely low concentrations (ng/ml), and appearto be safe to animals and humans. Under growth chamberconditions, direct application of acetoin on roots showed asigniﬁcant reduction of pathogen growth at 96 h after chal-lenge (62). Furthermore, drench application of bacterial vola-tiles to pepper roots increased ISR under ﬁeld conditions1550 MINIREVIEWS APPL.ENVIRON .M ICROBIOL . Downloaded from https://journals.asm.org/journal/aem on 08 February 2024 by 14.139.226.226. (C.-M. Ryu, unpublished data). Taken together, these data suggest that bacterial VOCs are good candidates for improvingdisease control through enhanced management of induced dis-ease resistance. MULTIPLE ROLES FOR BACTERIAL PHENAZINES Phenazines, a diverse class of heterocyclic secondary metab- olites, have been studied for many years due to their antibioticproperties and role in virulence (55). However, the complexityof the roles phenazines play in the lifestyle and behavior of theproducing organism is only now beginning to be recognized.Phenazines are produced by a wide diversity of Eubacteria and some Archaea (44). Both pathogenic and beneﬁcial bacteria produce phenazines. For example, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ,a soil inhabitant and opportunistic pathogen, produces severalphenazines, including pyocyanin. Pyocyanin production is cor-related with mortality in immunocompromised patients. Incontrast, Pseudomonas ﬂuorescens and Pseudomonas chlorora- phis are examples of beneﬁcial phenazine producers, and pro- duction of phenazines by these root-colonizing bacteria is re-sponsible for fungal disease suppression on plants (56, 68). Phenazine biosynthesis is highly conserved among microor- ganisms. Bioinformatic comparison of phenazine biosyntheticgenes among a subset of known producers demonstrated a highdegree of conservation in ﬁve clustered genes that are consid-ered the core phenazine biosynthetic genes. The conservationacross taxa suggests that many bacteria acquired these genesvia horizontal gene transfer (44). Although some bacteria pro-duce one phenazine derivative, the majority produce morethan one. The differences among natural phenazines are due toone or more accessory genes adjacent to the core genes thatencode different terminal-modifying enzymes that alter thesubstituent added to the basic phenazine structure (43). Froman evolutionary perspective, it is interesting to speculate thatthese single terminal-modifying genes, responsible for the pro-duction of different phenazine structures, may play signiﬁcantroles in determining the success of the phenazine-producingbacterium in diverse ecological niches. P. chlororaphis strain 30-84, a beneﬁcial root colonizer ef- fective against take-all disease of wheat, produces two majorphenazines in different amounts, a yellow phenazine-1-carbox-ylic acid (PCA) ( /H1101190%) and an orange 2-hydroxy-phenazine- 1-carboxylic acid (2OHPCA) (ca. 10%) (56). The gene phzO , which encodes a monooxygenase, is responsible for the con-version of PCA into 2OHPCA (13). Phenazine production isrequired for both the persistence of strain 30-84 on plant rootsin natural soil that contains other microorganisms and suppres-sion of pathogen growth (46, 56). Phenazine biosynthesis instrain 30-84 is regulated at multiple levels, including PhzR/PhzI QS (57, 74) and GacS/GacA two-component regulation(8). QS mutants of strain 30-84 were defective in bioﬁlm for-mation, and as expected, it was intriguing to note that a phen-azine-speciﬁc structural mutant ( phzB mutant) was equally de- fective in bioﬁlm formation (40). Complementation of thephenazine mutant restored bioﬁlm formation, demonstrating arole beyond antibiosis for these compounds. The roles of PCA and 2OHPCA on pathogen inhibition and bioﬁlm development by strain 30-84 were examined by chang-ing the ratio of PCA/2OHPCA. Derivatives of strain 30-84were constructed in which phzO was inactivated or in which additional copies of phzO were introduced in trans (39). These mutants produced altered ratios of PCA versus 2OHPCAwhile producing similar total amounts of phenazine. The PCA-only producer was less effective in inhibiting mycelial growth ofthe pathogen than the wild type or the 2OHPCA overpro-ducer, demonstrating the importance of 2OHPCA productionfor pathogen inhibition. Compared to the wild type or thePCA-only producer, the 2OHPCA overproducer adheredmore quickly to glass surfaces (44% total coverage comparedto 1% after 45 min), formed thicker bioﬁlms than the wild type,and had a low dispersal rate. In contrast, the PCA-only pro-ducer had a thicker bioﬁlm with a 4-fold-higher biovolume ofcells than either the wild type or the 2OHPCA overproducer.These results suggest that 2OHPCA facilitates cellular adhe-sion, whereas PCA facilitates bioﬁlm growth. These results areconsistent with the hypothesis that bacteria produce differentphenazine structural derivatives in speciﬁc concentrations dueto the different roles they serve for the population. REGULATION OF SECONDARY METABOLISM AND BIOCONTROL The GacS/GacA two-component system in biological control pseudomonads has a central role in regulating the expressionof biocontrol factors in several pseudomonads. Unknown sig-nals trigger activation of the sensor kinase GacS, and then theresponse regulator GacA is activated by phosphorelay. Theactivated GacA positively controls the transcription of regula-tory small RNA when cells reach high population densities.These small RNAs bind to discrete proteins, RsmA and RsmE,relieving translational repression from speciﬁed genes (32).Microarray analysis with P. aeruginosa reveals 241 genes to be regulated by the GacS/GacA system, with near-complete over-lap with genes controlled by the regulatory small RNA (7).Recent studies in P. aeruginosa ,P. syringae , and P. ﬂuorescens CHA0 indicate that upstream of the GacS/GacA hybrid sen-sors, RetS inhibits and LadS activates the Gac/Rsm pathway bydirect interaction with the GacS sensor kinase (25, 60, 72).Even though many intermediates in the signaling pathways ofthe GacS/GacA system are identiﬁed, the processes are notfully elucidated, especially with respect to variability betweenisolates. A nonpathogenic aggressive root colonizer, Pseudomonas chlororaphis strain O6, also illustrates the regulatory power of the GacS/GacA signaling pathway. Strain O6 produces severalsecondary metabolites, including phenazines, pyrrolnitrin, hy-drogen cyanide, and siderophore, as beneﬁcial traits. Rootcolonization by P. chlororaphis strain O6 induces systemic re- sistance against various plant pathogens (67) and abioticstresses of drought and salinity (11). Recent proteome andmutational analyses of the GacS/GacA system in strain O6demonstrated that the GacS/GacA system plays key roles inbeneﬁcial trait regulation as well as in general metabolism andcontrol of secretion (Y. C. Kim, unpublished data). The GacS/GacA system positively regulated production of the intra- andintercellular signaling compounds, acyl homoserine lactones(AHSL) (67); production of antimicrobial compounds, includ-ing phenazines, hydrogen cyanide, and pyrrolnitrin (28); induc-tion of induced systemic resistance (67), through positive reg- VOL. 77, 2011 MINIREVIEWS 1551 Downloaded from https://journals.asm.org/journal/aem on 08 February 2024 by 14.139.226.226. ulation of the volatile component 2,3-butanediol (21); and RpoS expression and, thus, other genes dependent on thisalternative sigma factor (29). Additional functional analysisshowed that GacS in P. chlororaphis strain O6 is involved in production of bioﬁlms, although this isolate possesses plasticityto form bioﬁlms in a GacS-AHSL-independent manner (2, 24).Interestingly, synthesis of another inducer of systemic resis-tance in plants, 4-carbamoyl acetic acid, is not under GacScontrol (52), and production of indole acetic acid is negativelyregulated by GacS (27). Proteomic analyses of the function of regulator mutants have been used to discover which pathways are coregulated.Recently, analyses of GacS mutants identiﬁed novel proteinswith as yet largely undetermined roles in biological control,including a serine protease (PspB) connected with phase vari-ation and aggregation, two proteins involved in DNA repair (aputative single-strand binding protein, Ssb, and a recombina-tion-associated protein, RdgC), an isoprenoid biosynthesisprotein, GATase1_ES1, and glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyl-transferase, RmlA, possibly involved in polyketide biosynthe-sis, cell surface structures, pilus assembly protein (CpaC andpeptidoglycan-binding LysM), and outer membrane protein(OprF) (51) (Kim, unpublished). These results point to thecomplexity of regulons related to the expression of biologicalcontrol phenotypes within a single agent. And in pseudo-monads as well as other bacteria, other global regulators arelikely to be present and relevant. For example, a clpgene homolog has been shown to be an important regulator ofmultiple biocontrol phenotypes in Lysobacter enzymogenes (30). INTERSECTION OF SECONDARY METABOLISM, GLOBAL REGULATION, AND THE ECOLOGY OF BIOCONTROL BACTERIA In Gram-negative bacteria, secondary metabolite production usually is controlled by two-component regulatory systemssuch as GacS/GacA (34). It was observed that secondary me-tabolite production is unstable during in vitro growth in rich media, with secondary metabolite mutants becoming the ma-jority population, and such spontaneous mutants can also ap-pear on plant roots (9). Previous work demonstrated that thesephenotypic variants had mutations in either the gacS orgacA gene, encoding a two-component sensor kinase or responseregulator, respectively, that controls the production of multiplesecondary metabolites, including phenazines, proteases, andhydrogen cyanide (8). Gac mutants may be considered “eco-logical cheaters” because they displace the wild type in nutri-ent-rich medium. However, in the rhizosphere in natural soil,the outcome of the interaction is very different, with the wildtype beneﬁting from the presence of the Gac mutant. Forexample, when starting from 50:50 mixtures with Gac mutants,the ﬁnal rhizosphere populations of wild-type strain 30-84 weresigniﬁcantly greater than populations of the wild type startingfrom a 100:0 treatment despite being introduced as only halfthe inoculum in mixture (9). Recent work in the L. S. Pierson lab has compared the relative ﬁtness of wild-type strain 30-84 and mutants defectiveingacA orphzB (a phenazine-speciﬁc mutation) in mixed bio- ﬁlms using a replacement series containing speciﬁc proportionsof wild-type strain 30-84 and either the gacA mutant or the phzB mutant (percentages of 100:0, 50:50, and 0:100, respec- tively, keeping the total inoculation density constant). As pre-dicted, in the absence of phenazine production, neither mutantalone formed bioﬁlms. However, in the 50:50 mixture of wild-type and 30-84 GacA, the biovolume of 30-84 GacA was ashigh or higher than the biovolume of the wild-type GacA inpure culture. The combined biovolume of both strains inthe mixed population was 3-fold higher than the biovolumeof the wild type alone, indicating that both strains beneﬁted bythe presence of the mixed community. In contrast, in the 50:50mixture of the wild type and the phzB mutant, the phzB mutant competitively displaced 30-84 (W. W. Driscoll and E. Pierson,unpublished data). These data support previous ﬁndings thatbetter survival of wild-type populations in mixtures with Gacmutants may beneﬁt the survival of the wild type in the rhizo-sphere, and thus the Gac mutant phenotype may be selectivelymaintained, whereas phenazine-speciﬁc mutants do not beneﬁtthe population and therefore should not be maintained asphenotypic variants. Previously, van den Broek et al. (69) pro-posed that spontaneous gac mutations, including reversible switching between functional and nonfunctional Gac pheno-types, may be a conserved strategy among rhizosphere pseudo-monads, which improves their success in the “heterogeneousand challenging environment of the rhizosphere.” Thus, itseems likely that substantial variation can occur, even amongpopulations of active biocontrol strains. EXPERIMENTAL PATHS TOWARD A GREATER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW SECONDARY METABOLISM AFFECTS BIOLOGICAL CONTROL The studies described above show that individual secondary metabolites can play multiple roles in the ecology of plant-associated bacteria. And because the production of these me-tabolites is under complex and hierarchical regulatory control,the production and effects of such metabolites need to beconsidered in light of their pleiotropic activities. Given thecomplexity of bacterial genomes, their secretomes, and thecommunities of organisms to which they belong, it is a daunt-ing task to make sense of the phenomenon known as thebiological control of plant pathogens. Nonetheless, newer toolsand analytical approaches are providing fruitful resources fortackling the fundamental questions of biocontrol (i.e., whichpopulations matter? When do they matter? What do they do?And to what extent can we control their activities?). To betteranswer those questions and fuel the success of a growing bio-pesticide industry, future research in biocontrol will need toprogress along three main avenues (Fig. 1). These will focus onthe biocontrol agents themselves and examine more carefullythe complex biotic and abiotic environments within which bi-ological control occurs. The ﬁrst avenue of research will entail the identiﬁcation and characterization of secondary metabolites and genes that con-tribute to biological control, along with the regulatory net-works that determine their expression. It has long been knownthat more than one mechanism can contribute to biocontrolactivity expressed by a single organism, but the full repertoireof biocontrol-related genes expressed (and metabolites se- 1552 MINIREVIEWS APPL.ENVIRON .M ICROBIOL . Downloaded from https://journals.asm.org/journal/aem on 08 February 2024 by 14.139.226.226. creted) by a single strain has yet to be fully investigated. This, however, is about to change. Since the ﬁrst reported sequenc-ing of biocontrol bacterial genomes just a few years ago (10,54), the technology to rapidly sequence, annotate, and mutatebacterial and fungal genomes has become widespread. Can acombination of “omic” and mutant analyses lead to the dis-covery of the full suite of biocontrol genes and products pre-sented by a single agent? Can distinct or integrated regulons ofthese genes be deﬁned? Current research in a number of lab-oratories is focusing on characterizing and substantiating theimportance of various secondary metabolites (e.g., phytohor-mones, bacterial volatiles, lytic enzymes, polyketides, and non-ribosomal lipopeptides) as well as their associated transportersand regulators. But many other genes are also likely to beimportant. For example, Mavrodi et al. (45) found that threegenes related to pathogenicity in some pseudomonads wereimportant for the superior root colonization of a biocontrolstrain. To be sure, much work needs to be done in this area,because there are hundreds of genes per genome that are goodcandidates for mutational studies based on what we alreadyknow about biocontrol. But there are also hundreds moreunannotated genes, many of which can be found in operon-likestructures. These, too, will need to be investigated for theirprimary and potential pleiotropic effects on metabolism ofbacteria and their plant hosts. And though much of this workis being done in biocontrol pseudomonads, where genetic toolsare well developed (20), more work in other plant-associatedbacterial genera (e.g., Bacillus ,Burkholderia ,Lysobacter ,Mit- suaria , and Streptomyces ) is warranted because of the potential to discover completely new genes and chemistries with rele-vance to biological control. The second avenue for progress will be to more fully identify and characterize the diverse microorganisms that affect planthealth, both positively and negatively. Historically, this hasbeen done through random phenotypic screens of culture col-lections (18) and by the proﬁling of enrichment cultures and/orculture collections for classes of genes already known to beinvolved in biocontrol, as has been done for some Pseudomo- nasspp. and Bacillus subtilis (26, 49). However, more rapid progress has been made recently using culture-independentproﬁling of soil- and plant-associated microbial communities(4). For instance, community proﬁling of terminal restrictionfragment polymorphisms of 16S rRNA genes has led to theidentiﬁcation and marker-assisted recovery of completelynovel bacterial genera and species not previously associatedwith biological control (3). Recent work has shown that abroad array of bacterial populations may contribute to soil-borne disease suppression in take-all decline soils (65), a nat-ural form of suppression once thought to be largely due to thespeciﬁc suppression of just a few taxa (72). And a tremendousamount of uncultured diversity of phlD /H11001pseudomonads (i.e., a well-studied group of biocontrol bacteria that produce 2,4- diacetylphloroglucinol [72]) have been noted to occur in sup-pressive and conducive soils and may contribute to diseasesuppression on a single plant (17). Such diversity needs to bemore thoroughly cultured, catalogued, and characterized todetermine the extent to which each might contribute to planthealth in various contexts. There is much interest currently inmetagenomics (36); however, the high degree of sample-to-sample variation, our limited knowledge of bacterial diversity,and relatively high per-sample cost make the approach less attractive than the ribosomal gene-based approaches for now.But there is no reason a metagenomics-based comparisoncould not be used today to generate candidate markers usefulfor directing the isolation of novel bacteria as has been donebefore (3). Can such approaches greatly expand the number ofuseful biocontrol agents? Will they lead to the discovery ofnovel strains with new secondary metabolites? Because thebreadth of possible pathosystems is so diverse, it seems likelythat such work will continue for as long as there is a demandfor novel and more effective microbial (and biochemical) bio-pesticides. Built on this foundation, and central to progress in under- standing the true nature of biocontrol, the third avenue ofresearch will be aimed at understanding the integration ofmetabolism of biocontrol-related genes in ﬁeld-relevant mul-titrophic systems (i.e., with host, pathogen, and biocontrolagents). Early studies of this sort have revealed that in a singlespecies, some biocontrol genes matter more than others forcontrol of a particular pathogen (14), that different strains ofbiocontrol bacteria can affect the expression of each other’sbiocontrol genes (42), and that changes in abiotic soil proper-ties alter biocontrol performance (50). Can evidence of theimportance of one gene or regulon in one context be extrap-olated to other contexts? Will more such studies reduce orexpand the number of genes and regulons considered to beimportant for biocontrol in a particular agent? We think that future studies will not only have to examine “snapshots” ofmetabolism at particular time points, but they will also needto begin to characterize the shifts of metabolism that occurduring the dynamic processes of colonization, infection, andhost ontogeny. And such studies will need to be consideredin the context of daily and seasonal cycles and variation inkey abiotic variables as well. This may be achieved by moreintensive sampling and throughput (again justifying the low-cost-per-sample proﬁling methods, such as terminal restric-tion fragment length polymorphism analyses) or by the de-velopment of in situ monitoring based on reporter gene technology (34). While this review has focused exclusively on plant-bacterium interactions, it is clear that the approaches described aboveapply equally as well to studies of plant-associated fungi thatalso promote plant health. In parallel to the work on beneﬁcialbacteria, similar work is likely to proceed in the ﬁeld of fungalbiocontrol, where tremendous inroads have already been madein the study of Trichoderma spp. (1, 22). But the genetic trac- tability and relative simplicity of bacterial genomes will morerapidly provide leads essential to the development of a newsynthesis and understanding of plant-microorganism interac-tions. These types of studies will further bridge microbial ge-netics and ecology and, by doing so, extend our ability tomanage plant health.

Ensuring health of food plants is critical to maintaining the  quality and productivity of crops and for sustenance of the rapidly growing human population. There is a  close linkage between food security and societal stabil ity; however, global food security is threatened by  the vulnerability of our agricultural systems to numerous pests, pathogens, weeds, and environmental  stresses. These threats are aggravated by climate change, the globalization of agriculture, and an over-reliance on non-sustainable inputs. New analytical  and computational technologies are providing  unprecedented resolution at a variety of molecular, cellular, organismal, and population scales for crop  plants as well as pathogens, pests, beneficial microbes, and weeds. It is now possible to both characterize useful or deleterious variation as well as precisely manipulate it. Data-driven, informed  decisions based on knowledge of the variation of biot ic challenges and of natural and synthetic variation  in crop plants will enable deployment of durable in terventions throughout the world. These should be  integral, dynamic components of agricultural strategies for sustainable agriculture.    Specific findings:  ● Genetic improvement of crops is the most reli able, least expensive management strategy when  suitable genetic variation is available. Nonetheles s, some interventions have not proved durable due  to the evolution and global dispersal of virulent pathogens and pests as well as herbicide-resistant  weeds.  ● Additional strategies are becoming essential as multiple fungicides, nematicides, and herbicides  become ineffective due to the evol ution of resistance and/or are phased out due to registration  withdrawals.  ● Strategies are needed that maximize the evoluti onary hurdles for pathogens, pests, and weeds to  overcome control measures. Interventions need to evol ve as fast as the biotic challenges. Moreover,  deployments of interventions must be driven by knowledge of the evolut ionary capacity of the biotic  challenge.  ● Considerable knowledge exists but more research into the mechanisms of plant immunity and other  forms of resistance is needed as the fo undation for translational applications.  ● Several new technologies are increasing foundational knowledge and providing numerous  opportunities for generating crops with durable resistance to pests and diseases as well as control of weeds and reduction of the envir onmental impact of agriculture.  ● There are multiple strategies for counteracti ng biotic challenges involving canonical and non- canonical disease resistance ge nes, genes encoding susceptib ility factors, small RNAs, or  immunomodulators. Simultaneous deployment of disease resistance strategies with different modes  of action, as well as the judicious use of fungici des, will enhance durability of control measures.   ● Pathogen effectors provide tools fo r discovering resistance genes and susceptibility factors as well as  for dissecting/manipulating plant biology and br eeding plants for durable disease resistance.  ● There are several, as yet little exploited, opportu nities for leveraging beneficial interactions among  plants, microbes, insects and other organisms in the phytobiome to enhance plant health and  productivity as well as breeding plants to promote beneficial phytobiome communities.   ● Global monitoring of plant health is feasible and de sirable in order to anticipate and counter threats.   ● Climate change increases the need for continual global monitoring of pathogens, pests, and weeds  and adjusting of control strategies.   ● There are numerous current and future opportunities for knowledge exchange and partnerships  between developed and developing countries to fost er improved local and global food security.  ● Both genetically modified (GM) and non-GM strategies are needed to maximize plant health and food  security.  ● Significant, sustained financial support is requ ired if the beneficial impacts of foundational and  translational research on global food security are to be realized.   The needs, opportunities, approaches, and deliverables fo r addressing biotic challenges to plant health  are detailed in  Supplementary Table S1 . These can be broadly classified as assessing variation,  characterizing it in detail at a variety of scales, and deploying beneficial interventions. Immediate MPMI Vol. 30, No. 7, 2017. http://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-01-17-0010-CR   4 / Molecular Plant-Microbe Interactions investments in global monitoring of pathogens/pests and in situ  and ex-situ  determination of what natural  variation exists in crop plants for countering chall enges and threats should be a high priority. Detailed  investigations of the molecular basis of the variou s types of plant resistance and of the basis of  pathogen/pest virulence are critical for providing the foundation for novel  intervention strategies; these will  be facilitated by development of high resolution structural and functional analytical techniques.  Optimization of protocols for delivery of reagents for allele replacement and gene insertions into diverse  major and minor crop plants should be a high priority. Monitoring and deployment should be a global endeavor involving multinational partnerships an d knowledge exchanges in order to ensure that  interventions are locally relevant and globally durable.

More people living longer, healthier, more affluent lives will put increased pressure on  food production systems. Climate change is predicted to further exacerbate challenges to food  production. Furthermore, insufficient food is a majo r causal factor inciting civil strife. The large  investments being made in human health will be of little benefit if people are undernourished.   Sustainable increased food production requires both technical and organizational advances.  Major, sustained investments in foundational and translational agricultural research are needed.  Pathogens, pests, and weeds cause large pre- and post-harvest losses, while beneficial symbionts  provide the opportunity to improve yield stability,  quantity, and quality (Biber-Freudenberger et al. 2016;  Palmgren et al. 2015; Rodriguez and Sanders 2015). Support for this area of agricultural research is  therefore both justified and urgent.  Forty researchers from the United States and Unit ed Kingdom gathered at the British Embassy in  Washington, D.C. for two days in September, 2016, to explore research opportunities focused on the  understanding of interactions of plants with pathogens , pests, and weeds as well as with symbionts and  other beneficial organisms in the phytobiome. Pa rticipants discussed the potential of foundational  knowledge generated by such research to enhance the health of plants economically important for agriculture, horticulture or forestry in the Unit ed Kingdom, United States, and globally. Research to  understand and ameliorate the emergence and spread of resistance of pathogens, pests or weeds to control measures was discussed. In addition, the workshop considered the potential transformative impacts of new technologies, such as high thr oughput sequencing, synthetic  biology, genome editing, and  cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), on plant health research. This white paper describes the product of these deliberations.    Breeding crops for resistance to pests and diseases has tended to be a lower priority than  breeding for yield and quality when control chemicals hav e been available. However, the availability such  chemical interventions as well as their efficacies are now becoming limited due to changes in legislation  and the evolution of pathogen/pest re sistance to control chemicals. Consequently, established cropping  systems are highly vulnerable to disruption by adapt ed pests, weeds, and diseases and there is a  pressing need for new interventions (Bruce 2016;  Tamiru, Khan, and Bruce 2015). For example,  management of insect pests has become much more challenging after recent restrictions on neonicotinoid and organophosphate insecticides in the UK. There are significant problems with herbicide  resistant weeds such as black grass an d fungicide resistant pathogens such as Septoria  leaf blotch.  Roundup resistant weeds have emerged in the United  States, challenging soil-conservation measures  dependent on minimum tillage. Similarly, new strategies  for nematode control become essential as soil- acting nematicides are phased out.   Research on plant-microbe/pest interactions is at an inflection point. Durable disease resistance  to pests or pathogens can be defined as “resistance that has remained effective over long periods of widespread agricultural use” (Johnson 1984). This ha s been a continual and often elusive goal in many  disease control programs for decades; however, we  now have opportunities to provide more durable  resistance based on foundational knowledge a nd recent technological advances. Long-standing  questions as to the molecular and genetic basis of  specificity between hosts and pathogens/pests are  being answered in increasing detail (Couto and Zipfel 2016; French, Kim, and Iyer-Pascuzzi 2016; Toruño, Stergiopoulos, and Coaker 2016). There is stil l much more to be discovered as to how the plant  immune system functions and how it can be predicta bly deployed with minimal side effects on yield and  other important agronomic traits. Nevertheless, ther e is now sufficient foundational knowledge to develop  and implement strategies that are likely to provide durable control of pathogens, pests, and weeds as well  as to improve yields and yield stability (Dangl, Horv ath, and Staskawicz 2013; Michelmore, Christopoulou,  and Caldwell 2013). Although less is known, advance s are also being made in the understanding of  beneficial biotic interactions, with concomitant opportuni ties for improving plant health (Bulgarelli et al.  2013; Hacquard et al. 2015; Vorholt 2012).   Many of the recent advances have been enabled by technological innovations and further high- impact developments are imminent. In particular, the ev er-decreasing cost and increasing output of DNA MPMI Vol. 30, No. 7, 2017. http://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-01-17-0010-CR   6 / Molecular Plant-Microbe Interactions sequencing technologies now enables the genome sequenc ing of multiple genotypes of many model and  non-model plants as well as microbes, pests, weeds a nd whole communities associated with plants or in  soils. Combined with increasing computational  resources, these sequences are allowing the  characterization of genomic variation, gene expression patterns, the identification of candidate genes for  resistance, and pathogen population genet ics. Proteomics, functional scre ens, ultra-high resolution light  microscopy, and cryo-EM are revealing the molecula r events involved in resistance and susceptibility  (Kuhlbrandt 2014). Synthetic biology provides multip le opportunities and approaches for redesigning plant  responses, which may allow for more precise control of the plant's ability to sense and respond to  pathogens (Feng et al. 2015; Medford and Prasad 2016). Genome editing technologies are greatly  enhancing functional investigations and deployment of  useful genes (Chandrasekaran et al. 2016; Zhang,  Liang, et al. 2016). Both synthetic biology and genome editing also provide the opportunity for generating  useful genetic variation in numerou s crop plants (Soyk et al. 2017).    This workshop report considers the opportuniti es for advances in foundational research and then  the issues involved in translating this knowledge to enhance plant health, particularly in less developed  countries.   Foundational Research Needs, Opportunities, and Challenges  Improving Genetic Resistance  Durable resistance to pathogens and pests (Brett Tyler, Jean Greenberg, Jonathan Jones)   As defined above, durable resistance is an empirica l, retrospective attribute that has no single  inherent basis. Pathogen and pest populations are highly variable and are evolutionarily driven to  overcome plant resistance. Consequently, predicting which new disease resistance genes may be durable is challenging. While some resistance genes are rapidly rendered ineffective by changes in the  pathogen, others have proved to be durable. for example, Rps1k  in soybean (40 years and still widely  effective; (Schmitthenner 1999), Xa21  in rice (Song et al. 1995), and H1 in potato for resistance to cyst  nematode (first deployed in 1960s an d still controls almost all European G. rostochiensis ; (Bakker et al.  2004). Knowledge is needed to implement strategies that maximize evolutionary hurdles for the pathogen  to become virulent. Therefore, identification of resi stance genes that may prove to be durable requires a  comprehensive understanding of pathogen biology, population structure, epide miology, mechanisms of  genetic and epigenetic variation as well as knowledge of plant immune system recognition and signaling to provide predictive outcomes upon manipulation.    While it is difficult to predict durability of dise ase resistance, it is easie r to predict, and therefore  avoid or minimize, a likely lack of durabilit y based on analyses of pathogen populations. Breeding  programs would benefit from avoiding or minimizing the use of narrow-spectrum R genes that are already  ineffective against local pathogen races. It is therefore important to define the pathogen/pest  component(s) recognized by any to-be-deployed R gene to avoid ""pathogen-blind"" resistance breeding  (breeding that does not take pathogen variation into  account; Vleeshouwers et al. 2011). Analyzing the  durability of resistance (R) genes, including those in corporated into elite germplasm, at the center of  pathogen diversity can help predict durability. For R gene s (e.g. NLRs) that target effectors and for other  classes of potential resistance genes (e.g. PRRs) that may target other aspects of pathogen biology, it is  essential to determine the extent to which the pat hogen population is able to evade the targeting of  pathogen component(s) and to suppress the defense mechanisms associated with R genes. Even if an R   gene is identified that the pathogen cannot be observed to evade or suppress, it is desirable to examine  the ability of the pathogen to acquire new genetic or  epigenetic variations that enable the pathogen to  overcome resistance. R genes that recognize the most conserved and pr esumably indispensable  effectors should be prioritized if it can be ascertained that recognition of such effectors is not masked by other effectors or abrogated by second si te genetic variation in the pathogen.   Once effective disease R genes have been identif ied, they should not be deployed individually  because widespread plantings will select for variants capable of overcoming single R  genes. One  approach is to pyramid different R genes; if possibl e representing different classes (e.g. NLRs, PRRs),  should be pyramided together. This is beginning to occur e.g. soybean– Phytophthora sojae  (Li et al.  2010), rice-bacterial blight (Singh et al. 2001), and potato- P. infestans  (Tan et al. 2010) interactions.  Challenges to implementing this obvious strategy include the efficient identification of sufficient numbers MPMI Vol. 30, No. 7, 2017. http://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-01-17-0010-CR   7 / Molecular Plant-Microbe Interactions of R genes (see below) and ensuring preservation of gene pyramids during breeding that involves  crosses. Ideally, pyramids comprised of different co mbinations of R genes should be deployed in order to  diversify selection on the pathogen population in space and time. Furthermore, it is necessary to monitor  for any breakdown of individual R genes so that new  stacks can be assembled for effective disease  control. The use of genome editing (e.g. us ing CRISPR/Cas9) to generate stacks of R  genes at single  chromosomal locations will greatly facilit ate the stable deployment of multiple R  genes; however, while  generating loss of function alleles is now facile, techniques for allele replacements and gene insertions  using genome editing need improvement (Zhang, Liang, et al. 2016).   Additional layers of disease resistance can also  be combined with stacks of PRR and NLR genes.  For example, endogenous chemistries may be used to boost signaling, promote the association of beneficial microbes that confer induced systemic re sistance, and restrict invading pathogens/pests (see  section on chemical immunomodulators). There may also  be opportunities to amplify responses to help  create more durable resistance. Plants employ positi ve amplification loops mediated in part by membrane  proteins that associate with PRRs and endogeno us ligand/receptor complexes (e.g. DAMPs and  receptors; (Hou et al. 2014; Yeh et al. 2015). The ext ent to which these associ ated proteins are limiting  and could be manipulated to boost resistance signaling outputs is not known. However, lab experiments  with model plants overexpr essing some of these components have yielded promising results in priming  for stronger immune responses (Yeh et al. 2015). Both mechanistic studies with tractable model  pathosystems and translational trials with crops are needed to determine how well this approach will  work. It will also be informative to test whether disease resistance responses mediated by PRR and NLR  genes can be reprogramed or amplif ied using synthetic transcriptio n factors based on engineered TAL  effectors or CRISPR/Cas9-based transcriptional ac tivators. Conversely, engi neering suppressors of  negative immune regulators could also be beneficial for tipping the balance towards plant resistance (Lin  et al. 2015).   Identification and engineering of novel intr acellular and extracellular receptors (Jonathan Jones, Jean  Greenberg)   Plant defense against pathogens is activated upo n pathogen/pest recognition, most commonly  via cell-surface PRRs that recognize apoplastic  pathogen-derived PAMPs or via intracellular NLR  receptors that directly or indirectly recognize pat hogen/pest effectors delivered into host cells (Couto and  Zipfel 2016; Jones, Vance, and Dangl 2017). Plant breeders have long recruited diverse R genes, which  typically encode NLRs, although some encode PRRs or  other types of protei ns. Elevating disease  resistance of crops requires the identification and recruitment of lar ge numbers of diverse resistance  genes. This diversity can have multiple sources.   Wild relatives of crops are potentially abundant sources of R  genes. Most plants carry 100s of  NLR-encoding genes that exhibit extensive diversity (Jones, Vance, and Dangl 2017). Using sequence  capture to enrich for NLR genes prior to genome sequencing enables cost-effective interrogation of  sequence diversity (Andolfo et al. 2014). Combined wi th genetic analysis, this can greatly accelerate  discovery and recruitment of new recognition specificities (Witek et al. 2016). Species outside the primary  and secondary gene pools are also potential sources of NLR genes. The discovery of widespread NLR  gene pairs, one member of which carries an integrated domain that mimics a host component targeted by  pathogen/pest effectors, and the observation that such gene pairs often work when transformed into  another plant family, suggests that many such pairs  may provide resistance when transferred between  distantly related taxa (Le Roux et al. 2015; Sarris et al. 2016). For example, rice is famously resistant to all rusts; perhaps some of its gene pairs with int egrated domains would conf er rust resistance if  transferred into wheat. The presence of paired NLRs, one with an integrated effector decoy domain (Le  Roux et al. 2015), has raised the prospect of replac ing one integrated domain with another. For example,  removing the Arabidopsis RRS1 WRKY domain and repl acing it with another domain targeted by other  effectors may be fruitful. However, since such domains are likely to have a role in maintaining the  receptor complex in the inactive state prior to in teraction with an effector, substitution may perturb  intramolecular interactions and result in constitutive  activation of defense. It is  therefo  re necessary to  better understand the functioning of a diverse set of su ch NLR pairs and to screen to find pairs that are  amenable to substitution of integrated effector decoy domains while retaining function. MPMI Vol. 30, No. 7, 2017. http://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-01-17-0010-CR   8 / Molecular Plant-Microbe Interactions  Engineered R  genes have been a long-standing aspiration of researchers in the field and could  be a useful source of additional variation. We have no t currently reached the point where novel NLRs can  be designed to recognize any effector. To be able to design novel recognition capabilities, we need better  understanding of the basic mechanisms of NLR protei n function. This will be facilitated by structural  insights gained by recent advances in biophysica l techniques such as cryo-EM (Kuhlbrandt 2014;  Maqbool et al. 2015). NLRs have two important functions: they must remain ""off"" and only turn ""on"" in the  presence of a cognate effector. One challenge is that m odifications often result in constitutive activity of  an engineered NLR; so it is crucial to understand in tra-protein domain interactions that inhibit NLR  activation prior to effector recognition. It is often presumed that activation is associated with a change in oligomerization state that imposes or induces prox imity or conformational changes on the N-terminal  signaling domain (Jones, Vance, and Dangl 2017). However, knowledge of whether this occurs, and of  ensuing steps in the process, is inadequate. There is a need for research on NLR mechanisms in multiple  pathosystems. Although we cannot yet design new disease resistance genes, foundational knowledge  has enabled some new recognition capacities to  be created. For example, changing a protease  recognition sequence in the PBS1 ""guardee"" protein enabled its guard, the RPS5 NLR protein, to  recognize different protease effectors (Kim et al. 2016). Knowledge of which pathogen proteases are  important players in plant-pathogen in teractions will facilitate the development of multiple novel R genes.  A major constraint on obtaining novel recognition abilities  is the capacity to screen for R proteins that  provide a useful phenotype without constitutive ac tivation. If clones could be transiently delivered and  tested for capacity to recognize specific effectors, fo r example with a defense promoter:luciferase reporter  fusion, thousands of clones could be evaluated in  a high-throughput manner. Synthetic biology and  genome editing tools can also be used to develop ru les for assembly and engineering of novel NLRs.   Signaling from cell surface PRRs is slightly be tter understood than signaling from NLRs (Couto  and Zipfel 2016). We are, however, again not yet at  the stage where PRRs can be designed with novel  recognition capacities. As with NLRs, more detailed structural information is required before this will be possible. In the interim, identification of additional natural diversity in PRR recognition capacity would  impact crop improvement. A promising approach is to screen diverse plants for novel PRR recognition  capacities and to transfer useful corresponding receptors between taxa. For example, species in the Brassicaceae  can detect the apoplastic bacterial translation factor EF-Tu via the RLK EFR, but  Solanaceous species cannot; transfer of EFR to species in the Solanaceae  elevates resistance to several  bacterial diseases (Lacombe et al. 2010). There is an  urgent need to discover novel PRR ligands from a  broad spectrum of pathogens/pests, including nematodes and aphids (Manosalva et al. 2015). PRR  ligands will be useful for direct identification of new PRRs, screening for natural variation in strongly  responding PRRs, and engineering new PRRs. Prospecting for novel recognition capabilities should involve biochemical exploration of pathogen components  that trigger defense responses, searching for  natural or induced genetic variation in such rec ognition capacity, cloning the corresponding receptor, and  inter-generic transfer. Sequence capture targeted to RLKs and RLPs (""PRR-seq"") could enhance the efficiency of identification of novel PRR genes. Devel opment of methods to engineer effector-insensitivity  into PRR response pathways that are disrupted by pathogen effectors is an additional opportunity.  Identification and deployment of  diverse resistance loci (Scot Hulbert, Richard Harrison, John Walsh,  John McDowell)   In addition to canonical plant immune receptors such as NLRs and PRRs, genes encoding other  types of resistance are important for adding diversity and potential durability to resistance.  One source of  useful genes will be quantit ative disease resistance  (QDR) loci. QDR determi ne host resistance that  results in a reduction, but not complete absence of disease. QDR can be controlled by quantitative  variation in NLR or PRR activation or by complete ly different mechanisms (French, Kim, and Iyer- Pascuzzi 2016). QDR is frequently controlled by multiple quantitative trai t loci (QTL) that interact with  each other and are influenced by the environment (F re  nch, Kim, and Iyer-Pascuzzi 2016). Some QTL  may encode modifiers that enhance immunity; others may encode genes that are not components of the  immune system. Emerging opportunities for engineering enhanced resistance includes a better  understanding of the mechanisms underlying QDR, includi ng the role of chloroplasts and other organelles  in plant defense. Genes have been identified that confer partial resistance to multiple diseases, including  several rust species, and even to broad ranges of pathogens (French, Kim, and Iyer-Pascuzzi 2016;  Moore et al. 2015). Pyramiding multiple QDR loci, ei ther through marker-assisted breeding or the MPMI Vol. 30, No. 7, 2017. http://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-01-17-0010-CR   9 / Molecular Plant-Microbe Interactions application of genomic selection, can provide broad s pectrum resistance; for example, four QDR loci,  each controlling a different aspect of resistance to the blast fungus, have been pyramided in rice  (Fukuoka et al. 2015). Natural variability at QDR loci  can be identified using classical genetic approaches,  pathogen phenotyping, and analyzing molecular markers of defense. Characterization of QDR loci can  determine at which step during infection resistance is  acting and if weak activation of classical defense  signaling is induced. Transfer of existing, evolut ionarily unique resistance mechanisms to other plant  species is likely to be feasible in many instance s. Pyramiding multiple sources of QDR with canonical  immune receptor loci is a desirable strategy to achieve durable resistance.    There is great interest in the identification of  plant susceptibility (S) gene s that facilitate pathogen  development and their manipulation for durable diseas e control (Singh et al. 2001; van Schie and Takken  2014). S genes that act during different stages of in fection and against different pathogens and insects  have been identified (Liu et al. 2013; van Schie and Takken 2014). Recent advances in genome editing  technologies greatly enhance our capacity to mani pulate multiple S genes in crops. This approach is  exemplified by S genes that control viral replication and  translation in their hosts. Potyviruses require the  host translation initiation complex including the cap-binding protein eIF4E (Kawaguchi and Bailey-Serres 2002). Natural variants in eIF4E and eIF(iso)4E  have been identified in multiple plant species that abolish  susceptibility to potyviruses (van Schie and Takken 2014). Importantl y, plants possess more than one  initiation factor complex isoform; isoforms seem to  function redundantly and mutation of one isoform does  not affect plant vigor (van Schie and Takken 2014). A natural knockout of eIF(iso)4E in Brassica  resulted  in broad-spectrum potyvirus resistance (Nellist et al. 2014). CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutations of eIF4E  have been shown to be a viable strategy for engineering resistance to multiple potyviruses in cucumber  (Chandrasekaran et al. 2016). Similarly, knockout of eIF4E in tomato provided resistance to two  potyviruses; however, plants remained susceptible to other potyvirus strains (Piron et al. 2010), indicating  further research is needed to understand potyvirus- eIF4E /eIF(iso)4E interactions to inform exploitation  and development of durable resistance. However, thes e pathosystems illustrate the potential of S loci as  sources of resistance.    The identification of effector targets also provides opportunities for detection and targeting of new  plant S genes. Multiple Xanthomonas transcription activator-like effectors enhance the expression of  genes encoding SWEET sugar transporters, which are attractive  targets for genome editing (Streubel et  al. 2013). The wild type MLO gene in barley suppresses defenses against powdery mildew disease and is  conserved across the plant kingdom. Natural and induced loss-of-function mlo alleles have been  generated in multiple species using a variety of appr oaches including radiation and genome editing (Luo,  Gilbert, and Ayliffe 2016). However, mutation of MLO can have deleterious physiological consequences  requiring analysis over multiple environments and possibly introgression into an appropriate genetic  background (Hulbert and Pumphrey 2014; van Schi e and Takken 2014). Pathogen lifestyle should also  be taken into account when targeting S genes and stacking different resistance genes. An R gene against  a biotrophic pathogen can function as an S gene during infection by necrotrophic pathogen (Lorang,  Sweat, and Wolpert 2007). Enhancing the foundational  understanding of QDR and S genes provides an  opportunity to expand our understanding of the mechanisms controlling both resistance and susceptibility.  This information can then be translated into effective disease control strategies, especially with the advent  of genome editing.  Modulating Plant-Microbe Interactions  Altering host-pathogen interactions using small RNAs (Blake Meyers, Wenbo Ma, Roger Innes)   Small RNAs are central players of RNA silenc ing, which is a universal and fundamental  mechanism of gene regulation in eukaryotes. Extensive studies have established small RNAs as  essential regulators of growth and development; mor eover, accumulating evidence implicates small RNAs  as having an integral role during plant-pathogen inte ractions that influences the outcome of pathogen  challenge (Baulcombe 2015; Fei et al. 2016). Spec ific plant and pathogen small RNAs are activated  during infection and there is bi-directional trafficki ng of silencing RNAs between multiple filamentous  pathogens and their hosts (Baulcom be 2015; Weiberg et al. 2013). The importance of host small RNA  pathways in plant defenses is evidenced by the multiplicity of effectors produced by viral, bacterial and oomycete pathogens that target host RNA silencing pathways (Pumplin and Voinnet 2013; Toruño,  Stergiopoulos, and Coaker 2016). Our understanding of the involvement of smal l RNAs in pathogen/pest MPMI Vol. 30, No. 7, 2017. http://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-01-17-0010-CR   10 / Molecular Plant-Microbe Interactions interactions is far from complete; for example, addi tional foundational studies are needed to address the  regulation of immune-related host genes via endoge nous microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering  RNAs (siRNAs) or other silencing pathways, with potential implications in epigenetics (Fei et al. 2016).  There is also an urgent need to understand the mechanisms by which small RNAs are transferred from pathogens/pests to host cells and vice versa .    As our understanding of small RNA function and evolution advances, the number of novel  opportunities to deploy this knowledge to safeguard plant health will increase. Pathogen suppression of  host silencing pathways may be mitigated to maintain or enhance endogenous resistance. Host-induced  gene silencing (HIGS) and RNA interference (RNAi) are being demonstrated in an increasing number of  biotrophic, hemibiotrophic, and necrotrophic intera ctions (Baulcombe 2015). The efficacy of these  approaches should be tested in numerous pathosystems, particularly against insect s, pests, and parasitic  weeds for which there are currently few alternative control measures. C onstitutive ectopic expression of  small RNAs can profoundly affect endogenous sma ll RNA profiles with potentially deleterious  consequences; research is needed to fine tune approaches such as HIGS. Research is also needed to  determine if exogenous application of small RNAs is an efficacious approach to pathogen control and if  so, what is the most effective way to deliver sm all RNAs exogenously. Because HIGS and RNAi can be  targeted against vital pathogen/pest processes, they ar e anticipated to be durable; however, research is  necessary to investigate the potent ial of pathogens and pests to counteract control strategies based on  small RNA-centric approaches and to identify optimal  targets to reduce the chances of evolution of  resistance.     Multiple technological advances can facilitate a greater foundational understanding of small RNAs  as well as aid in the deployment of translational appr oaches to utilize small RNAs for crop improvement.  High-resolution imaging will enable investigations  of transfer and localization of RNAs, both in vitro  and in  vivo, at tissue and subcellular levels, throughout the dynam ic process of infection. Similarly, sequencing  and quantification of small RNA, mR NAs, and small RNA targets in single cells will allow informative  dissection of small RNA biology in plant-pathogen/ pest interactions. Continued increases in genome  sequences of both crops, models, and their pathogens, coupled with detailed molecular and biochemical  experiments, will enable studies of the diversity of  mechanisms by which plants and pathogens deploy  and manipulate small RNA pathways to enhanc e resistance or avoid disease.   Immunomodulating chemicals: Opportunities for chemical biology  (Jean Greenberg, Alisa Huffaker)   Plants produce diverse small molecules that have t he potential to significantly impact plant health.  These compounds can collectively be considered me tabolite immunomodulators. Their characterization  could lead to breeding or engineering efforts to enhance plant health; also, some modulators may be  useful for direct application to plants either as sprays or soil additives. Both beneficial and pathogenic  microbes and pests also produce chemical-based effect ors/toxins that might be exploited. Examples of  activities of potentially useful metabolites incl ude direct antimicrobials/antipests (Ahuja, Kissen, and  Bones 2012; Christensen et al. 2015), signaling intermediates and pathway modulators (Shah,  Chaturvedi et al. 2014), secreted compounds t hat can impact the phyllosphere or rhizosphere  microbiomes (Huang et al. 2014), and pest/microbe chem ical effectors that modulate plant behavior and  resistance (Ma and Ma 2016).   To successfully exploit chemical immunomodulator s, we need to define the chemical repertoires  of plants and interacting organisms under diverse conditi ons, infer processes impacted by diverse sets of  metabolic outputs, identify biosynthetic and regula tory mechanisms, and identify targets and modes of  action. Furthermore, plants have dive rse chemistries, some of which are family- or species-specific.  Therefore, screening broad taxonomic groups is warrant ed. This will require collaborations with analytical  chemists for natural products analysis and synthesis for proof of concept and/or deployment. A finer understanding of the roles of these metabolites will be gained when single cell metabolic analyses are  feasible in order to dissect their roles in space a nd time during the infection process. An important goal  will be to identify pathways for synthesis and action using biochemical genetic screens, metabolite-based  genetic mapping, and expression based analyses; howe ver, to fully realize the o  pportunities for  identifying metabolites with potential value as control agents, additional assays may need to be  developed. Opportunities also exist to generate novel compounds through using combinations of  biosynthetic enzymes that may not occur nat urally together (Wurtzel and Kutchan 2016).   MPMI Vol. 30, No. 7, 2017. http://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-01-17-0010-CR   11 / Molecular Plant-Microbe Interactions At present, comprehensive metabolite analysis is  not routine, especially when mixtures are  complex, chemical libraries are limited, and ther e are many unknown compounds. Investments in  national/international repositories for plant/microbe/pe st metabolite identification and analysis are needed.  Several approaches can be used and combined to identify immunomodulating chemicals. These include  exploiting differing chemistries among diverse genetic  backgrounds and mutant collections,  informatics- led searches for novel predicted enzymes and activiti es (e.g. (Rajniak et al. 2015)), and bioassay-based  approaches for discovery of new activities (e.g. anti-pest, anti-microbial, defense priming). As the sensitivity of instruments for chemical analysis im proves and chemical libraries expand, it will become  increasingly feasible to survey root exudates, vascular exudates, apoplastic extracts, plant-pathogen interface sampling, secreted molecules from microbes and pests to identify high value metabolites. As new activities and compounds are inferred, partitioni ng can be used to reduce the complexity of  metabolite extracts. For this, it will be important to utilize multiple and co mplementary methods of  extraction, derivatization, separations, and analysis . Once isolated, high-value unknowns can then be  synthesized to determine their direct biological acti vities and mobility. Additionally, they can be more  finely monitored to discern their spatial distributions.    There will be several translational opportunities  stemming from these efforts. Biosynthetic  pathways could be engineered to produce new bioactive metabolites into plants or other organisms; these  could be useful beyond plant health applications. Furt hermore, for pathogen/pest-derived chemicals, a  next step will be to develop strategies  such as HIGS to abrogate pest/microbe chemical effectors. As  noted above, chemical immunomodulators could be applied in the field or plants with altered chemistry  could be bred/engineered as part of a disease control strategy. Knowledge of the chemical repertoires of  plants and their associated microbes/ pests could allow the design of se nsitive metabolite biosensors that  would act as sentinels for perturbations.  Exploiting Organismal Interactions with Plants  Pathogen effector molecules as tools for accelerated pr oduction of disease resistant crops and dissection  of plant biology  (Sebastian Eves-van den Akker, Jean  Greenberg, Wenbo Ma, John McDowell)   Diverse pathogens, pests, parasites, and symbiont s deploy large repertoires of secreted proteins  known as effectors to modify host processes for their benefit. Effector activities range from the  suppression of plant immunity to the manipulation of host biochemical and developmental processes. In  addition to these virulence activities, effectors c an trigger immunity following recognition by cognate  receptors, often NLR proteins (Lee et al. 2015). Effectors are thus central in dictating the outcomes of  plant immunity and disease development. Comprehensive characterization of effector repertoires and  determination of their modes of ac tion should therefore be a high priori ty. Understanding effector biology  offers several opportunities for disease control, as well as tools for manipulating plant biochemistry and  development in the absence of disease.  Effectors that trigger immunity can expe dite the discovery of R genes (see above and  (Vleeshouwers and Oliver 2014). Selection of breeding ma terial with individual effectors is an informative  alternative to marker-assisted sele ction that can facilitate pyramiding  multiple R genes, each of which  confers resistance to most or all strains of a pathogen by allowing selection of each R gene individually.  Effectors have been effectively used in resistance breeding to control diseases caused by diverse classes  of pathogen (biotrophs, hemibiotrophs, and nectrotr ophs) (Vleeshouwers and O liver 2014). Effector- directed breeding also provides the possibility of iden tifying and prioritizing R genes that recognize core  effectors that are broadly conserved within the species and play important roles in virulence. R genes that  recognize core effectors are pot entially more durable to pathogen co-evolution, because deletion or  silencing of the effector would impose a fitness penalty on the pathogen; however, the caveats regarding  possible second site compensating mutations and redundancy in effector function need to be considered  (see section on durable resistance above). In additi on, effector-based screens can be used to identify  sources of resistance in plants that ar e non-hosts for the pathogen of interest.   Effectors are also needed for comparative function al studies of the biophysical/biochemical basis  of immune-receptor activation (see above) (Maqbool et al. 2015). This will address how many ways there  are to activate NLRs and how receptor complexes are impacted biochemically and biophysically by  immune modulating effectors. Having this information will provide opportunities to re-wire activation  mechanisms to facilitate resistance. MPMI Vol. 30, No. 7, 2017. http://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-01-17-0010-CR   12 / Molecular Plant-Microbe Interactions  The roles of effectors that target host pr ocesses to enhance pathogenicity are less well  understood relative to their roles in triggering immunity. However, it is already clear that effectors from  divergent pathogens and pests target conserved pat hways, such as flagellin and chitin mediated  immunity, vesicle trafficking, and RNA silencing. Effector-targeted pathways reflect the strategies used by  particular pathogens to overcome host defenses and es tablish disease. Mechanisms by which effectors  alter host physiology, cell biology, signaling, and nutri tion are profoundly under-explored. Multiple effector  target genes identified so far encode susceptibility factors (Boevink et al. 2016; Yang et al. 2016). Such  host factors can potentially be manipulated to provi de resistance. Genome editing technologies can be  employed to alter effector targets such that they re tain function but no longer act as susceptibility factors  (e.g. SWEET  genes activated by Xanthomonas TAL effectors) (Li et al. 2012; Streubel et al. 2013).  Large scale sequencing and functional screens are leading to characterization of effector  repertoires of an increasing number of pathogens and pests; however, this is fa r from comprehensive.  Motif-based sequence analyses (e.g. the RXLR peptid e motif of oomycetes) (Bhattacharjee et al. 2006)  and the DOG box promoter motif of cyst nematodes (Eve s-van den Akker et al. 2016) as well as structural  similarity to fungal MAX and RALPH proteins (de Guillen et al. 2015; Spanu 2015) have revealed extensive repertoires of effectors. However, these searches only detect a subset of effectors and in the  case of insect pests no such predictive motifs hav e yet been identified. Therefore, additional criteria are  needed to identify effectors (e.g. prevalence, evidence  for selection, reasonable levels of expression, and  ideally, demonstration of a contribution to virulenc e or fitness). Furthermore, downstream functional  analyses would be greatly facilitated by routine transf ormation, gene knock-out, and allele replacement  technologies. All plant-parasitic nematodes, inse ct pests, and many fungi and oomycetes remain  refractory to transformation, at least in part due to a lack of resources directed to this goal. Genome  editing mediated by CRISPR/Cas9 has recently been reported in the oomycete Phytophthora and this  technology holds promise as a tool for pathogen transformation (Fang and Tyler 2016). In addition, high- content screening (phenomics), in conjunction with  reporters for alterations in host biological  processes/metabolism/pathways (Qiao et al. 2013), could revolutionize the detection of causal  relationships between effectors and non-immunity related phenotypes.   Effectors honed over millennia of host-pathogen co-evolution also provide tools for the finely tuned and exquisitely-specific manipulation of plant processes. Such tools may aid our fundamental  understanding of plant biology, ultimately facilitati ng novel biotechnological applications (Li et al. 2012).  The extent of host physiological manipulation during in fection can be substantial. Some parasites, pests,  pathogens and symbionts are able to induce the form ation of novel organs in which the number and/or  size of organelles is modified (e.g. giant cells fo rmed by root-knot nematodes or galls formed by  Agrobacterium tumefaciens or Phylloxera ), while others can greatly modify source-sink relationships (e.g.  green islands surrounding ru st pustules). The ability to harness thes e effector function s and engineer the  proliferation of chloroplasts, mitochondria, or even amyloplasts in specific tissue types has clear potential  for biotechnological utility. In addition, effector biology has facilitated the discovery of biological  processes. Examples of recently discerned effector biochemistries include: a newly identified mechanism  of PTM (Zhang, Ma, et al. 2016), novel PTMs (e.g. urid ylation of several receptor like-cytoplasmic kinases  by AvrAC, (Feng et al. 2012); acetylation of histidin es, (Lee et al. 2015) and novel metabolites (Schuebel  et al. 2016). Consequently, knowledge of effector fu nctions enables foundational research into the  biological processes of the plant cell.  A detailed understanding of effector functions can have translational applications far beyond the  plant sciences. For example, the sequence specific  DNA binding activity of TALENs, discovered from  Xanthomonas effectors acting as transcription factors, has  been exploited for genome editing (Boch,  Bonas, and Lahaye 2014). Such applications coul d not have been predicted using classical DNA-binding  protein identification algorithms and highlight how many potentially useful fun  ctions may remain in the  largely uncharacterized portions of effector repertoires.  Phytobiomes: Exploiting knowledge of organismal interactions to increase plant health (Duncan Cameron,  Toby Bruce, Jeff Dangl)    In addition to improving genetics of a crop itse lf to enhance resistance against deleterious  organisms, there are multiple opportunities to us e beneficial plant-associated organisms as allies  (Phytobiome_Roadmap 2016). These include many types of microbes, arthropod predators and MPMI Vol. 30, No. 7, 2017. http://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-01-17-0010-CR   13 / Molecular Plant-Microbe Interactions parasitoids, companion crops, and other organisms. B eneficial microorganisms play a central role in  maintaining plant health in terms of both nutrition and defense. For example, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi  (AMF) and plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGP R) not only enhance plant nutrient capture but also  can directly modulate plant defenses (Cameron et  al. 2013; Hiruma et al. 2016). The advent of high- throughput DNA and RNA sequencing technologies and increased capacity for characterizing small  molecules from soil samples have driven a rapid expa nsion in environmental genomics directly germane  to plant productivity (Blaser et al. 2016). However, virt ually nothing is known of the principles of evolution  and biochemistries that determine the composition of plant-associated microbiota above and below ground. Robust experimental systems are crucially  needed to investigate principles of microbiota  structure and function, from reducti onist settings, through increasingly complex ecological settings, to  deployment. Most crops have been bred independently of  many of their rhizosphere- and phyllosphere- associated organisms, potentially due to  loss of microbe diversity and inte nsity in agricultural ecosystems  as a result of tillage and chemical inputs (Helgason et al. 1998). Traditional breeding programs may have  inadvertently selected against beneficial microbial asso ciations due to their use of high nutrient conditions  and pesticides, which decrease opportunities for mi crobial benefits. For example, under ample soil  nutrient conditions, the carbon drain of  AMF can present a fitness cost, potentially selecting against traits  favoring mycorrhizal associations. Research is requ ired to evaluate the performance of different crop  genotypes under low input conditions, including their ability to attract and sustain beneficial  microorganisms.  There is a dearth of knowledge as to how intra- or inter-specific plant genetic variation impacts  the plant-associated microbiota. Current results supp ort the existence of a core microbiome that may be  tuned by specific plant genotype x microbiome and genotype x environment interactions (Vorholt 2012,  Bulgarelli, Schlaeppi et al. 2013, Hacquard, Garrido-O ter et al. 2015). For example, plant root exudates  contain signaling chemicals that influence the species co mposition of the rhizosphere but little is known of  natural genetic variation influencing the support of beneficial rhizosphere microbes. Harnessing beneficial  microbes will be increasingly important as low-till, low-input agricultural systems are adopted (Cameron  2010). Foundational research is also needed to ident ify appropriate combinations of beneficial organisms  that can be used to develop cocktails of plant growth  promoting or biocontrol or ganisms. Addressing this  difficult challenge is dependent on deriving associations  of microbes that provide diverse benefits to  plants and are also able to invade and persist as  complex microbial communities in the target  environment, potentially in a co-dependent manner.   Research is needed to investigate trade-o ffs involved in hosting potentially beneficial  microorganisms. Priming is a long-lasting memory t hat provides potentiation of faster and stronger  defense responses (Bruce et al. 2007; Conrath et al. 2015). Beneficial microorganisms have been  demonstrated to induce defense; well-studied exampl es include root-colonizing bacteria that promote  plant growth and provide enhanced broad spectrum resi stance (Induced Systemic Resistance, ISR) to  several types of pathogens (Biere and Goverse 2016). Pathogens can also activate resistance distant  from the site of infection (Systemic Acquired Resistance, SAR) (Cecchini et al. 2015). Some signaling components are involved in both of t hese long-distance responses. The cha llenge is to ensure that plants  have the capacity to be well-colonized with ISR- promoting microbes and also capable of adequately  activating these signaling pathways for resistance. Pr iming or induction of plant defenses, particularly  SAR, may incur a yield penalty, which is yet to be fully understood. Germplasm should therefore be  screened to find genotypes amenable to beneficial col onization. Plant genes that regulate responses to  different microbial populations should also be char acterized to identify input genotypes for breeding  programs to enhance beneficial associations. Progress  towards implementing these strategies will require  extensive sequencing for microbial characterization, high resolution metabolomics, the ability to culture and maintain promising organisms, and the ability to assess many plants rapidly for a variety of responses.    It is important to develop interventions for improving plant health that go beyond altering crop  genetics. Small molecule signals generated in res ponse to beneficial microorganisms could be  commercialized for external application, in a similar manner to chemicals inducing SAR (e.g. azelaic acid  and BABA (Cecchini et al. 2015; Jung et al. 2009)). Both  biological control and biopesticides have much  scope for development. There are multiple approaches  to improving biological control by boosting MPMI Vol. 30, No. 7, 2017. http://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-01-17-0010-CR   14 / Molecular Plant-Microbe Interactions populations of natural enemies of pests, pathogens, and weeds. Classical biocontrol involves recruiting  biological control agents from the areas of origin of invasive pests and weeds and introducing them to the  areas where they have invaded. This approach has h ad several impressive successes as well as some  inconsistent results. It requires long-term rese arch efforts to find candidates, determine likely  effectiveness, and verify safety. Conservation biocontrol involves exploiting resident populations of natural enemies of pests, weeds and pathogens as an  ecosystem service; interventions to improve the  effectiveness of conservation biocontrol are required to  support natural populations. Again, the new tools  for determining microbial community structure and identifying insect pest population structure help to build  mechanistic understanding of the ec osystems, leading to more reliable predictions. This requires food  resources and suitable habitat. Considerable progress has been made with field margins to support  populations of natural enemies of insect pests; ho wever, there is often insufficient movement of  beneficials into the crop where they are needed. Lure and reward strategies to attract beneficials with semiochemicals coupled with food rewards that enhance their fitness and performance are required  (Stenberg, Heil et al. 2015). A greater foundational under standing of the ecology of tritrophic interactions  and signaling is needed to enable better recruitment of natural enemies of pest s (Stenberg et al. 2015;  Tamiru, Khan, and Bruce 2015), perhaps by breeding. Companion cropping can both repel pests and attract their natural enemies; a successful example of  this is the push-pull system in Kenya (Khan et al.  2010). The development of biopesticides involves formulation of living organisms, for example an  entomopathogenic fungus or a virus that affects insect s, can kill the pest target and can be sprayed or  applied like a pesticide. Research priorities includ e discovery of new agents, development of new  biopesticide delivery methods, and approaches in whic h a killing agent is formulated with an attractant  semiochemical.   Novel opportunities to control viral diseases (Lesley Torrance, Wenbo Ma, Savithramma Dinesh-Kumar)    Because viruses are obligate intra-cellular pathogens with small genomes, they are completely  dependent on cellular host factors to complete their life  cycle and on vectors such as insects, nematodes,  or plasmodiophorids for dissemination. Plant viruses are comprised of either RNA or DNA genomes, which typically encode only four to ten proteins and differ in replication strategies (den Boon, Diaz, and Ahlquist 2010; Hanley-Bowdoin et al. 2013). Severa l aspects of viral biology remain insufficiently  characterized.  The last decade has seen major advances in ch aracterization of host factors involved in  replication and movement and virus manipulation of  host gene regulation (Wang 2015). Viruses also  modify host and insect vector behaviors (Blanc and Michalakis 2016; Casteel et al. 2014). However, the  knowledge of the underlying mechanisms is still lacki ng. In addition, virus-plant and virus-vector  interactions as well as regulato ry host small RNAs are affected by environmental factors such as  temperature and light (Blanc and Michalakis 2016; G hoshal and Sanfaçon 2014; Sunkar 2010). A greater  understanding of environment-mediated regulation of viral infection is needed. The basis of virus  specificity for certain cell types and tissues and why some viruses have wide or narrow host ranges are  also not understood. It is known that hormone and defense pathways are affected by viruses, but  information on spatial and temporal restriction of viru ses at the cellular level is lacking. Discovery of the  underlying reasons may enable the development of novel strategies that restrict virus infection. The  drivers of virus evolution and the mechanisms by which vector population complexity influences viral  population composition and transmission remain incompletely known.  Multiple studies are needed to address these gaps in our knowledge. Single-cell genomics and  transcriptional profiling may reveal molecular detai ls of viral restriction, cell autonomous and non- autonomous virus responses, basis of seed transmissi on, and the influence of environmental factors and  host developmental stage on virus infection. Developm ent of anti-viral peptides targeting key components  is needed to determine the basis of host and tissue s pecificity. Cryo-EM is providing previously  unobtainable, high-resolution structures of plant viruse s and it holds promise for resolving intracellular  macromolecular virus-associated complexe s (Hesketh et al. 2015; Kuhlbrandt 2014).   Approaches such as RNA-seq, small RNA se quencing, metabolomics, and proteomics should  facilitate dissection of molecular signatures that are altered in the vector during virus acquisition and in  the host upon infection. Furthermore, understanding of vector and host factors that facilitate virus replication and vector-mediated immune response on the virus is fundamental to engineering resistance  to vector-transmitted plant viruses.   MPMI Vol. 30, No. 7, 2017. http://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-01-17-0010-CR   15 / Molecular Plant-Microbe Interactions Post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) or RNAi is fundamental to defense against RNA  viruses. RNAi-mediated transgenic resistance strate gies are effective against RNA viruses (Fondong,  Nagalakshmi, and Dinesh-Kumar 2016), but not DNA viruses, which present different challenges for  control. CRISPR/Cas9 has recently been used to engineer resistance against DNA viruses (Fondong,  Nagalakshmi, and Dinesh-Kumar 2016; Ji et al. 2015); additional editing strategies need to be evaluated,  including modification of susceptibility factors as has been used against potyviruses (see above) (Zaidi et  al. 2016). Since mixed infections by multiple viru ses are common in field settings, CRISPR/Cas9-based  approaches should be evaluated for the feasibility of  engineering broad-spectrum resistance against  multiple viruses.   Minimizing and Monitoring Weed, Pathogen, and Pest Challenges  Weed control (Duncan Cameron, Rob Edwards).   The control of weeds is rapidly emerging as a major challenge to sustainable agriculture due to  the rapid evolution of herbicide resistance in both conventional and GM production systems (Cummins et  al. 2013). The problem has been further compounded by both the loss of many types of herbicide through  stricter regulation and the lack of research and development of new modes of action for herbicides; this  situation is unlikely to improve over the coming decade.   Herbicide resistance arises through two mechanisms.  1) Target site resist ance (TSR), where the  protein functions targeted by herbicides become insensit ive to chemical disruption. This can arise through  selection for genetic changes resulting either in reduc ed binding or in increased expression of the target.  2) Non-target site resistance (NTSR), where the acti vity of herbicides in weed tissues is reduced to sub- lethal levels either by neutralizing the herbicide, or through metabolic responses that reduce chemical  injury. Our understanding of both types  of resistance, their plastici ty and evolution, is currently  constrained by the lack of genome information for major agronomic weeds. In the case of NTSR, we lack fundamental understanding of the multiple mechanisms associated with this complex quantitative trait.    The opportunities for counteracting herbicide resistance can be broadly divided into developing  strategies for the better use of existing chemical  control measures, changing cultural practices, and  developing new approaches to weed control based on ne w crop traits. In reality, durable weed control will  likely require integration of all of these approaches . Immediate opportunities will be built on foundational  research in the biology of major weed species, incl uding the application of the technologies now in place  for functional genomics of crops such as genome sequencing, transformation, and editing. Studies should  be aimed at understanding the mechani sms underpinning the plasticity of  resistance and the molecular  basis of NTSR. Outcomes would include better diagnostic and predictive tools for the stewardship of existing products and the identification of new targets for intervention such as ‘resistance-busting’  synergists (compounds that restore the efficacy of the herbicde; Cummins et al. 2013). Changes in  cultural practice, such as alterations in rotations  and the use of cover crops as well as precision and  robotic weed control, offer the most immediate oppor tunities for counteracting resistance; these will be  best implemented through expanding training programs  for agronomists and agricultural engineers.   Public funding for field research programs to objective ly test the efficacy of different approaches to weed  control along with their life cycle analysis will be required to ensure rapid adoption.    To date, the use of genetic improvement as a route to weed control has relied on developing  resistance to specific herbicides in the crop,  the most well-known exam ple being Round-Up Ready  technology. This approach was initially projected to be durable; however, it has not proven durable due to  over-dependence on a single herbicide and the result ing selection on weeds to develop resistance.  Transformation of crops with new herbicide resistan ce genes still offers useful opportunities if used  carefully in the field. For example, glyphosate-res istant wheat (which could be derived from non-GM  classified transformation) would be a very useful tool  to counteract NTSR in wild grasses in Europe.    In the longer term, the introduction of novel w eed control traits into crops has great potential for  future integrated management. There are multiple reports of weed-suppressive crop varieties. The underpinning mechanisms such as allelopathy, plant vigor, and nutrient use efficiency require greater  foundational understanding prior to effective translat ion. Our advancing knowledge of plant pathology  may also provide new strategies for weed control, including new herbicides based on microbial pathogens  or mechanisms used by them, matched with crop s bred to be resistant to these biologicals.  MPMI Vol. 30, No. 7, 2017. http://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-01-17-0010-CR   16 / Molecular Plant-Microbe Interactions  Control strategies developed for pathogens are al so relevant to controlling weeds that directly  parasitize other plants. Parasitic weeds including Striga  in sub-Saharan Africa and Orobanche  spp. in the  Mediterranean can significantly limit crop yields both in the tropics and temperate regions. Traditionally,  chemical control of parasitic weeds has been difficult  because parasitic plant lifecycles are complex and  the host and parasite have similar physiologies (Gressel and Joel 2013). In addition, resistant germplasm  has been difficult to develop. Modern approaches have resulted in a deeper understanding of host  resistance to parasitic plants (Timko and Scholes 2013). This makes introgression of R genes to current  commercially desirable crop varieties now possible and hence a priority for future research and control  efforts. Host-induced gene silencing targeted against vital parasite genes should be explored as a control  strategy where transgenic crops will be accept ed (Baulcombe 2015; Nowara et al. 2010).  Monitoring of pathogens, pests and weeds (Diane Saunders, Michael Shaw)   The implementation of any control strategy impos es selection pressures to overcome it. Recent  disease outbreaks in plants hav e been associated with expansions of pathogen geographic distribution  and increased virulence of known pathogens, such as in the European outbreak of ash dieback and  wheat stem rust in Africa and the Middle East (MacLean et al. 2013; Singh et al. 2015). The scale and frequency of emerging diseases have increased wi th the globalization and industrialization of food  production systems (Firth and Lipkin 2013). In the past it has been difficult to monitor for breakdowns in  control. Current surveillance and di agnostic systems are reliant on l engthy and costly in-lab processes,  such as PCR or ELISA based protocols. Genomic-based surveillance and diagnostic tools are still in their  infancy; however, advances in remote sensing and sequencing technologies and increases in  computational power are allowing unprecedented oppo rtunities for real-time assessment of pathogen,  pest, weed, and symbiont populations and the rapid implementation of interventions. Following the  influenza paradigm of continual adjustment of the in tervention, deployment of control measures should be  driven by knowledge of the variability and evol ution of pathogen/pest populations (Michelmore,  Christopoulou, and Caldwell 2013).    High throughput sequencing is revolutionizing population genetics with further advances on the  near horizon. This has stimulated the development of genomic-based surveillance techniques. One example is the development of “field pathogenomics” for surveillance of pathogen populations (Hubbard  et al. 2015). This can be based on high-resolution transcriptome data acquired directly from field-collected samples of infected plant tissue. This approach was recently employed to determine the identity and  origin of a Magnaporthe oryzae  lineage that caused the first severe out break of wheat blast in Asia within  just six weeks of sample collection (Islam et al. 2016;  Malaker et al. 2016). Selective sequence capture of  virulence and resistance associated genes could also improve the cost-effectiveness and resolution of  field pathogenomics. Monitoring of human pathogen s has capitalized on the recent advances in  sequencing technologies; the deployment of portable real-time genome sequencing for surveillance of the  Ebola virus in Guinea using the MinION platform provided sequence data that could be immediately exploited for guiding control measures (Quick et al. 2016). Similarly, genome surveillance for Zika virus  using portable genotyping in Brazil enabled tracking of viral spread into new geographical regions.  Widespread deployment of such devices will allow real-time monitoring of plant pathogen variation as  long as it is accompanied by adequate reference sequence information. Detailed surveillance of pathogens and pests will reveal their population struct ure and effector repertoires at the individual and  pan species levels. Genome analyses can reveal the c enter(s) of pathogen diversity, which could be the  basis a network of phenotyping centers to analyze germplasm resistance. Fu rthermore, genomic-based  surveillance can also be employed to improve the diagnosis and differentiation of pathogens present that  are often misdiagnosed or present in mixed infections (e.g. Dothideomycete pathogens).    There are several challenges to robust monito ring. Sampling is a major problem. Recent work  has shown that adaptive sampling can improve the effi ciency of management of some diseases (Parry  2014; Parnell 2014, 2017); however, effective contro l requires detailed, intensive sampling of host  populations which may not be showing symptoms (Cunniffe et al. 2016).  The distinction between severe,  explosive invasions and minor outbreaks which requi re less expe  nsive intervention is challenging  (Thompson et al. 2016). Foundational research on both  theoretical and actual population dynamics on a  landscape scale is essential. Therefore, new idea s and technologies are needed to detect pathogens and  pests at very low frequency. This is critical for plan t hygiene and preventing introductions in the context of MPMI Vol. 30, No. 7, 2017. http://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-01-17-0010-CR   17 / Molecular Plant-Microbe Interactions increasing global trade. Monitoring for volatiles that  are either produced by the pathogen/pest or produced  as a consequence to the plant defense response may help with the detection of certain diseases. This  could enable the capture of latent diseases and would be deployable in shipping-based trade routes.  Latent disease could be detected by machines or dogs. This could be an excellent opportunity for  international collaborations to lead the development of diagnostic tools and testing their implementation.    Sensitivity is another challenge. Resistance to f ungicides is hard to combat because much of the  evolution has already happened when detected at the cu rrently typical threshold levels of a few percent.  Also, some fungicides are still effective even when some level of resistance exists (Oliver 2014). Loci  likely to be involved in development of resistance  are often known when a new fungicide class is  introduced; it would be desirable to detect very low leve ls of change at these loci. The challenge is to find  efficient, inexpensive, ways of sampling and to ta ckle the bioinformatics challenge of heterogeneous  samples with many loci being sequenced and examined simultaneously. Monitoring generates very large  datasets. Research is needed into methods for effi cient data gathering from large numbers of locations  and integration with meteorological data to allow accurate epidemiological modelling.   Remote sensing from drones or satellites is also  providing vast amounts of data with increasing  resolution and opportunities for monitoring crop health. In itiatives such as the aggregation of information  from CABI “Plant clinics” (Bruce 2016) with speciali sts able to analyze overall patterns are of great value,  but require research in both population biology and social science rather than only biological  understanding at the molecular level. Weeds, viruses,  nematodes, soil fungi that have limited capacity for  movement and produce patches observable from a distance are well suited to remote sensing. Research is needed to link image analysis with data on field performance and genotype, including ground observation of suspicious patches. There is the opportuni ty for integration of remote sensing with grower  observation and response; however, this will require st rong partnerships with growers and pest control  advisors.   Impacts of climate change on pathosystems and pathogen evolution  (Becky Bart, Jagger Harvey)   As we move towards lower input, sustainable agriculture under changing climatic conditions, it is  critical that disease and pest control strategies be considered in the context of the environmental variation  and uncertainties resulting from climate change. C limate change models project a range of potential  scenarios; as climates change, pathogens, pests and vectors will spread into new areas and new  diseases may emerge more frequently. While accurate climate modeling is still under development, the opportunity now exists to investi gate how temperature, humidity, CO 2 levels, light quality, soil quality, and  other environmental factors will affect plant health in the context of diseases and pests.    Experimental systems hav e advanced to the point that they c an inform the pathogen/pest layer of  climate change models. Investigations can be cond ucted using high-throughput , sophisticated phenomics  approaches to track pathogen and pest interaction with hosts in controlled environmental chambers  (Mutka et al. 2016) as well as in field settings  (Chakraborty and Newton 2011; Fahlgren, Gehan, and  Baxter 2015). Nonetheless, individual pathosystems need foundational studies before impact will be  realized because our current predictive ability on decadal  scales is severely limited (Shaw and Osborne  2011).  There is a dearth of funding for studies of relationships determining long- and medium-term  dynamics of plant disease; current understanding of host-pathogen-weather relations rarely extends to comprehension of changes in pathogen populations.    Complementary to studies on ecosystem and populat ion dynamics, it is possible to study how  environmental conditions that affect immune signaling at the molecular level. In cases where existing  resistance genes are functional only within specific temperature ranges, appr oaches facilitating the  expansion of this functional range could be explored.  Additional molecular and genetic approaches to  optimizing responses to biotic and abiotic stresses  should also be investigated (Fujita et al. 2006;  Whitham, McCormick, and Baker 1996). Climate change co uld also influence food safety; it is predicted to  increase the prevalence of mycotoxin contaminat ion, with new areas becoming at risk and current  hotspots having more frequent and severe episodes (Ba ttilani et al. 2016). Consequently, research into  multiple avenues for reducing mycotoxins in human and animal food should be a high priority.    Because many diseases and pests are highly mobile and climate change will result in changes in  cropping systems, global approaches to managem ent must be deployed across national boundaries. In MPMI Vol. 30, No. 7, 2017. http://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-01-17-0010-CR   18 / Molecular Plant-Microbe Interactions terms of food security, the effects of climate change may hit developing nations hardest, as these  countries will have less nimble crop improvement programs and therefore will be less able to respond to  climate change within existing breeding programs . Studying pathogen evolution on a global scale will  allow developed and developing countries alike to better anticipate and respond to emerging and  potential threats. Investments and collaborations with dev eloping countries are critical to secure future  harvests worldwide.    Translational Opportunities, Needs, and Challenges    The foundational research described above will pr ovide a plethora of possibilities, including  immediately implementable opportunities, for improving plant health in the field. No single intervention will  provide a complete solution to disease problems; ra ther, each intervention should be considered as a  component of integrated agricultural systems aimed at  providing sustainable, high quality yields. This  integration will require considerable coordination between academic, government, and private sector  entities. Most developed countries hav e long traditions of translational research, for example through the  Agricultural Experiment Stations in the US; however, state support for the continuum of foundational to  translational research has progressively been eroded in  both the US and UK as well as elsewhere. This  trend must be reversed if the beneficial impacts of fou ndational research on global food security are to be  realized. There is a fiscal “valley of death” betwe en innovation and effective deployment at scale. This  valley should be spanned by adequate public sector funding mechanisms to support pre-competitive  translational research, possibly by stimulating collabora tions of academic and government labs with small  and large biotech and plant breeding companies, both nationa lly and internationally. It is also critical to  have mechanisms, such as the cooperative extension system, to engage with end-users to increase the  adoption of newly available solutions. Professional  societies such as the American Phytopathological  Society (APS) and the British Society for Plant Pathol ogy (BSPP) should continue as effective advocates  for funding translational research and implementation at the local, national, and global levels.    There are several challenges to implementation of control strategies. One is the handling of  unprecedented amounts of data. Tools are needed to ac quire, curate, query, store, and distribute vast  datasets as well as integrate plant health information with other datasets, such as climate data, soil  characteristics, agricultural activities, and crop perf ormance. We are transitioning from a data poor to a  data (over)rich situation. We should be more concerned about false positives than false negatives  because the new technologies will present far more  potential leads than can be pursued. Consequently,  intelligent algorithms based on machine learning are needed to enable decision making in the context of precision, data-driven agriculture. These computational needs are far from unique to the plant health  area. Bioinformaticians and computer scientists who are tackling these challenges in other areas need to  be recruited to the plant health area.    Another key to successful implementati on will be the two-way knowledge exchange and  partnerships with all constituents in the food product ion and distribution chain, particularly growers,  extension personnel, pest control adv isors, and breeding company staff as well as consumer advocates  and policy decision makers.   Capacity building and knowledge transfer for developing countries (Jagger Harvey, Toby Bruce, Becky  Bart, Rebecca Nelson)  Translational research to enhance food security in developing countries was given specific  consideration at the workshop. Developing countries fa ce additional substantial challenges compared to  developed countries. The US and UK plant health res earch communities have been engaged in mutually  reinforcing collaborations and cultivation of the risi ng generation of plant health researchers as part of  programs funded by USAID and DIFD as well as foundations such as the Bill and Melinda Gates  Foundation (BMGF) and the CGIAR Consortium. This has resulted in significant cross-fertilization of ideas and exchanges of expertise and experience. In an er a in which population growth, climate change, and  emerging diseases demand a more global focus, mo dels for integrating developing country partners as  effective and equal collaborators are essential. These should be developed by scrutinizing extant and past collaborations for effectiveness, capacity-build ing of national systems, outcomes, and impact.  Strategies for focusing, integrating, and evolving such efforts are necessary to leverage the collective MPMI Vol. 30, No. 7, 2017. http://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-01-17-0010-CR   19 / Molecular Plant-Microbe Interactions expertise and resources. Such efforts should result in a more responsive, integrated and proactive global  community.   Although many developing countries in the tr opics and subtropics have enhanced their human  and infrastructural capacities over the past few de cades, these efforts must be improved and accelerated  because current capacity is inadequate to tackle t he environmental, agroecological, socioeconomic and  biodiversity (including pathogens and pests) complexities  faced by agricultural systems in these regions.  As an example, the USAID-supported CRSP and Innovation Lab efforts have trained ~3,500 developing  country MSc and PhD scientists in the past 30 year s. However, there have been limited efforts to  evaluate and leverage this investment by tracking the alumni pool and supporting them in their home  countries. The opportunity to access this quiescent expertise should be exploited to integrate these and a  rising pool of researchers and other actors in co llaborative efforts, and to generate a more global  enterprise. Broader collaborations to recruit and support researchers in developing countries would be a major, feasible consequential action.   Key considerations for effective capacity building and knowledge transfer include:  ● Giving national partners platforms and background information needed to assess and articulate  national and regional plant health issues so as  to develop national strategies and priorities.  ● Constructing collaborations and capacity building prog rams around priorities and strengths of national  partners that include complementary expertise from developed countries to address key challenges to improving food and nutritional security.  ● Establishing equitable, bidirectional partnerships where developing c ountry participants have leading  roles in major components of the research, including developing capacities in their own labs.  ● Assessing human and infrastructure capacity of in -country partners and where it can be effectively  enhanced to inform plans as to where components of research programs should be conducted. Over the course of projects, national partners should be em powered to conduct increasing proportions of the  research.  ● Enabling reciprocal exchanges of researchers at multiple levels from senior researchers to postdocs  and grad students as well as communications officers and agricultural economists. This applies to all  stages of the project from formulation to final reporting. ● Developing appropriate technologies for end-point use. For example, high throughput DNA  sequencing, RNA-Seq, small RNA-seq,  or LC-MS/MS may be used by partners with the necessary  infrastructure. As the project progresses, diagnos tic tests should be developed that can be used in  developing country labs or fields.   ● Engaging other actors along the pathway to impac t, including government (agriculture, health, trade),  regulatory, private sector, and extension personnel, while being sensitive to the way both societies work.  ● Developing international networking opportunities (match-making) to help interested scientists in  developed countries identify and engage with partners in developing nations and vice versa . This could  be achieved by conducting planning and workshop grant s to help groups with common interests come  together, likely facilitated by web-based platforms to hel p interactions and catalyze linkages; this could  have multiple levels, including extension information exchange.    A key component for successful implementation of disease management strategies will be  knowledge exchange with farmers. Farmers need to  be engaged to ensure that they are aware of  innovative approaches and that there is buy-in and adoption. This has to be a two-way process so that  researchers are aware of the farmers’ needs and priorities that lead to co-designing of solutions. There  are huge opportunities to use information technology to engage with farmers. This is not a substitute for face-to-face meetings, but is complementary to them and keeps contacts active. With resource  constraints to reach a very lar ge number of smallholder farmers (estimated to be 33 million in sub- Saharan Africa) with poor transport links and few extension personnel, there are opportunities to use mobile phones to crowdsource information about pl ant health priorities and collect feedback on what  works and does not work; the CABI Plantwise  initiative might serve as a model ( www.plantwise.org ).  Sharing information about potential solutions will targ et plant health interventions to hotspots where the  problems are the most serious. Creation and support of village-based advisers as well as farmer to farmer  networks are important because farmers are more convin ced when they see another farmer successfully  using an approach than if an outsider tells them about it.  MPMI Vol. 30, No. 7, 2017. http://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-01-17-0010-CR   20 / Molecular Plant-Microbe Interactions Acceptance of genetically modified crops (Jonathan Jones, Andrew Bent)  GM crops have the potential to make major contri butions to food security. In the area of biotic  challenges to plant health, they provide means to facilitate control of pests and pathogens for which  current control options are inadequate, while greatly reducing the use of chemical protectants and thus  reducing the environmental impact of agriculture (N AS, 2016). GM crops will be increasingly important to  prevent a crisis in a more highly regulated pesticide /fungicide world. The commercialization of GM crops  has so far been limited to a few crops,  focusing primarily on herbicide or  insect resistan ce (Giller 2016).  GM trait development and deployment should be expande d for traits that directly benefit the consumer  and that provide additional sustainability traits, incl uding disease resistance. A more rigorous science- based system of risk assessment and an accordingly adj usted regulatory system are needed, to maintain  stringent standards where appropriate while lowering  the extreme economic cost of making benign and  societally beneficial GM crop traits available to fa rmers and consumers. The ultimate release of GM crops  with new traits will depend on advances in research  and development, changes in public perception,  regulatory requirements, and health and environment al assessments (Ricroch and Hénard-Damave  2015). Adoptionwill also be facilitated by detailed cost -benefit analyses of economic and societal factors.   The opposition to GM organisms (GMOs) is mostly an ideological issue (Herman and Raybould  2013), while consumer antipathy is largely due to a lack of understanding of crop improvement methods  and zero tolerance of perceived risk. It is crucial to communicate better with the public and decision  makers so as to allay poorly founded concerns about GM technology and to counter emotion-based  opposition. It must be effectively conveyed that food crop s are the result of breeding that involves a suite  of technologies including chemicals, radiation, and molecular tools as well as conventional cross  breeding. Transfer of R genes between closely related plants may offer a precedent-establishing an  example of GM utilization that a broad sector of t he public sees to be low-risk, beneficial, and also  achievable but with far more costs, constraints, and reduced efficacy if done by traditional plant breeding.  Genome editing that results in transgene-free genetica lly improved plants, with useful DNA inserted or  deleterious DNA deleted at specific genomic locations,  could help promote consumer acceptance of GM  crops (Luo, Gilbert, and Ayliffe 2016). Efforts to fost er communication among consumers, policy makers,  industry representatives, and researchers should be c ontinued so that GM crops benefitting all parties  can be more readily brought into use. The potential benefits of GM crops to human health (e.g. camelina  producing omega-3 fish oils) and environmental health  (e.g. insect and disease resistant crops) need to  be communicated more effectively to the public. Novel approaches toward changing public opinion could  be deployed through collaborations between social scientists and those engaged in crop improvement.  Considerable diplomacy is required because the opposition to GMOs is well funded and organized and  resonates with public concerns about the environment  and food safety. International collaborations could  help provide evidence-based count er-arguments and examples to support a balanced and science-based  regulatory policy that would benefit the public, researc hers, and the agricultural industry. Britain’s exit  from the EU may provide an opportunity for developm ent of its own science-based regulatory framework  that is more consistent with t hose in the US, Australia, and Canada.  It is important that farmers and consumers cont inue to have options for both GM and non-GM  crops and food, at a reasonable price. Issues surround ing intellectual property pr otection of crop cultivars  apply to both GM and non-GM crop cultivars. Public  sector crop improvement programs could make  multiple contributions (for example, improvement of mi nor crop species, novel trait combinations for major  crops, and training of the next generation of plant breeders in the use of transgenics) and may help allay  various concerns (such as concerns over intellectual property and monopolistic control due to consolidation of the seed and biotechnology indust ries). It may become essential for governments to  enact policies so that publicly beneficial GM crop varieties can become more widely available.     Conclusions    There is great potential to increase food pr oduction, reduce the environmental impacts of  agriculture and enhance global food security, if adequate investments are made. However, this is a time- sensitive issue; climate change will likely cause pl ant health to worsen, reducing food security, and  leading to civil strife and mass migrations. Both short term and sustained longer term support for plant  health research is necessary to enable both immediate translational implementations and foundational  resea rch to address major challenges for which there are currently no solutions. Some funding resources MPMI Vol. 30, No. 7, 2017. http://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-01-17-0010-CR   21 / Molecular Plant-Microbe Interactions should be designed for flexibility to allow rapid responses to plant health crises when and where they  inevitably arise. Global monitoring of the health of major crops modelled on that being conducted for stem  rust ( http://rusttracker.cimmyt.org/ ) should be implemented to minimize the vulnerability of the food supply  to biotic challenges.   There are a broad variety of options for intervent ion strategies that maximize the evolutionary  hurdles that pathogens, pests, or weeds must overcome before they evade control measures. However,  development of alternative pest, weed, and diseas e management strategies is currently not happening  fast enough to fill the gap left by losses of chemical protectants due to legislation and evolution of  insensitivity. Current and imminent technologies could pr ovide flexible interventions and reduce response  times. Control strategies need to evolve at least as  fast as the pathogen, pest, or weed; if they do not,  then it is an ineffective use of time and resources to pursue those strategies. After further development,  genome editing-based allelic replacement and gene insertion hold great promise for accelerating  introduction of disease and pest resi stance genes into elite cultivars that will be more durable.      There are multiple barriers to rapid and effect ive implementations. These include not only a lack  of detailed foundational knowledge but also restrictions on germplasm exchange, legal and financial obstacles to deployment of GM crops, uncertainties surrounding IP and regulatory status of genome  editing technologies, a dearth of plant breeders to ex ploit the wealth of new knowledge and technologies,  and inadequate data handling capabilities.   The Green Revolution of the last century was largely based on the developm ent of crop cultivars  that responded well in terms of yield to high levels of inputs that included fertilizers and control chemicals.  The challenge now is to develop crops and agricultural systems that will continue to provide good yields  in the face of continuous evolution and global dissemination of pests, pathogens, and weeds as well as  changing and more stressful growing environments. Sustaining the world food supply requires excellence  in both foundational and translational research in parallel with agriculture becoming more data-driven.  The necessary technologies and expertis e are available such that, with sufficient investment, the future is  bright for improving plant health as part of integrated and sustainable agricultural systems.   Online feedback  provided by the international community at large within the first four weeks of the  paper’s online publication will be collated and included as an addendum.    References.

"Update on Light and Plant Immunity Canopy Light and Plant Health1 Carlos L. Ballaré*, Carlos A. Mazza, Amy T. Austin, and Ronald Pierik Instituto de Investigaciones Fisi ológicas y Ecológicas Vinculadas a la Agricultura, Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientí ﬁcas y Técnicas, Universidad de Buenos Aires, C1417DSE Buenos Aires, Argentina (C.L.B., C.A.M., A.T.A.); and Plant Ecophysiology, Institute of Environmental Biology, Utrecht University, 3584 CHUtrecht, The Netherlands (R.P.) During the course of this century, increasing human population and economic development will continueto put pressure on agricultural systems for increasedcrop yields (Rosegrant and Cline, 2003; Foley et al., 2005). Grains produced for livestock feed and biofuels are now competing for space with crops intended forhuman consumption (Foley et al., 2011), which means that in order to meet increasing global food demand and multiple objectives for arable land, new crop va-rieties with improved performance will have to be developed. At the same time, the use of fertilization, irrigation, and pesticides is very likely to increase(Oerke, 2006; Jaggard et al., 2010). The intensi ﬁcation of agricultural practices, however, creates environmen- tal and health concerns, which are already a matter of signiﬁcant scienti ﬁc and social debate. Alternative methods to increase crop yields without agricultural expansion and under conditions of reduced chemical use are urgently required. A particular concern for the growing intensity of agricultural practices is the management of pests and diseases, which can account for up to 25% of prehar-vest crop losses in agricultural areas managed with well-developed crop protection technologies (Pimentel, 1997; Oerke, 2006). In order to minimize these losses,expensive and potentially hazardous chemical controlstrategies are routinely applied, which are becoming increasingly regulated due to their negative impacts on human health and ecosystems (Birch et al., 2011).Furthermore, a recent analysis suggests that despite the massive (greater than 15-fold) increase in the use of pesticides during the past four decades, the overallproportion of crop losses to pests and diseases has not decreased (Oerke, 2006). It is interesting that while these levels of crop losses in agroecosystems aremaintained at a high cost, in natural ecosystems plant biomass losses due to insect herbivory are typically fairly small (approximately 10%; Schoonhoven et al.,2005). It seems possible that lessons could be learnedfrom natural defense mechanisms to reduce negative impacts of pests and pathogens and, consequently, theinputs of toxic chemicals used to protect crops andcrop yield from biotic stressors. Indeed, plants have demonstrated a broad repertoire of extremely effective tactics that allow them to ﬁght off natural enemies (Karban and Baldwin, 1997; Schoonhoven et al., 2005; Jones and Dangl, 2006; Wu and Baldwin, 2010; Agrawal and Heil, 2012). The mechanisms responsible for plant defense are becoming increasingly well understood at the molec- ular level (Jones and Dangl, 2006; Howe and Jander,2008; Panstruga et al., 2009; Wu and Baldwin, 2010).Major hormonal players in the regulation of immune responses have been identi ﬁed (Erb et al., 2012; Pieterse et al., 2012), and the functions of defense-related mol-ecules produced by plants are gradually becoming elucidated (D ’Auria and Gershenzon, 2005; Mithöfer and Boland, 2012). Our understanding of the regula-tion of defense systems by environmental signals or conditions is also increasing rapidly, and the discipline of plant biology is creating the knowledge base andconceptual foundation for the purposeful utilization of natural defense mechanisms in agriculture. Light has emerged as a key modulator of plant im- munity. However, until very recently, the bene ﬁcial effects of light on plant resistance to pests and disease have been largely unappreciated. In this Update, we brieﬂy highlight recent ﬁndings in this area, focusing on how changes in the canopy light environment, caused by the proximity of other plants, regulate plant immunity. We propose that a better understanding ofthe underlying mechanisms is essential for the devel- opment of healthier crop systems necessary for re- ducing the environmental costs of modern agriculture. PROXIMITY EFFECTS A major imperative for modern agriculture is to in- crease crop yield per unit area, due to the escalating demand of agricultural commodities and the simulta-neous need for preservation of natural ecosystems. Acommon strategy in the management of many crops for enhancing yield has been the implementation of prac- tices that increase canopy light interception, such ashigher planting density, reduced row spacing, and fer- tilization (Harder et al., 2007; De Bruin and Pedersen,1This work was supported by the Agencia Nacional de Promoción Cientí ﬁca y Tecnológica and Universidad de Buenos Aires (grant nos.

All Rights Reserved. 145Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/160/1/145/6109753 by guest on 09 February 2024 2008). All of these practices, which result in increased leaf area index (LAI), can substantially reduce individ- ual plant exposure to solar radiation, particularly earlyin the growing season (Flénet et al., 1996; Maddonniet al., 2001). The effects of plant density on the severity of plant disease caused by microbial pathogens are well doc-umented in natural and managed ecosystems (Burdon and Chilvers, 1975; Augspurger and Kelly, 1984; Bell et al., 2006; Jurke and Fernando, 2008), with a generalpattern of increased disease at high plant densities (for review, see Burdon and Chilvers, 1982; Alexander and Holt, 1998; Gilbert, 2002). Similarly, high densityand shading frequently increase plant damage by herbivorous insects and/or reduce the expression of antiherbivore defenses (Karban et al., 1989; Cipolliniand Bergelson, 2001, 2002; Yamamura, 2002; Robertsand Paul, 2006; Agrawal et al., 2012). The mechanisms that mediate these effects of crowding on plant health are elusive. In the case of microbial pathogens, micro-environmental factors such as air humidity and leaf surface wetness are likely to play an important role. However, several studies have shown that infection bya range of pathogens, and the success of several insect herbivores, can be affected by the light environment of the host before contact with the consumer organism(Roberts and Paul, 2006). In the following sections, wewill discuss how changes in the canopy light envi- ronment, caused by increased LAI and perceived by speciﬁc photoreceptors, affect the expression of plant defenses against biotic stressors. UV-B AND UVR8 Overcrowding, air pollution, and poorly lit urban environments are widely accepted to have played a role in the increased incidence of rickets, a bone dis- order of childhood, during the early days of the in-dustrial revolution in the 19th century (Holick, 2004).A link between sunlight deprivation and rickets was originally postulated in the early 1800s and experi- mentally con ﬁrmed nearly a century later by studies showing that the disease could be cured by exposing children with rickets to the radiation produced by a mercury arc lamp. These observations led, perhaps, totheﬁrst appreciation of the bene ﬁcial effect of sunlight and UV radiation on human health, an effect that is now documented and mechanistically linked with thephotosynthesis of vitamin D driven by UV-B radiation(280 –315 nm; Holick, 2004, 2007; Juzeniene et al., 2011). Positive effects of UV-B radiation on plant health have also been demonstrated, in spite of the fact thatthe vast majority of the studies of UV-B impacts were originally aimed to detect deleterious effects of UV-B on plant growth. Most examples of “beneﬁcial”effects of UV-B on plants come from studies of plant-herbivore interactions. Field experiments in which losses to phy- tophagous insects were compared between plantsgrown under either ambient or attenuated levels ofsolar UV-B radiation have shown that plant exposure to solar UV-B radiation typically increases plant re- sistance to insect herbivory (for review, see Caldwellet al., 2003; Ballaré et al., 2011; Kuhlmann and Müller,2011; Fig. 1). UV-B radiation has also been reported to increase plant resistance to microbial pathogens (Gunasekera et al., 1997; Wargent et al., 2006; Gunasekeraand Paul, 2007; Kunz et al., 2008; Demkura and Ballaré, 2012) and can interact with the plant to modify the composition of microbial communities in the phyllo-sphere (Kadivar and Stapleton, 2003; Balint-Kurti et al., 2010). Treatment with unnaturally high doses of UV-B radiation, or with UV wavelengths not present in thedaylight spectrum (UV-C, l,280 nm), has also been reported to activate defense-related pathways in several species (Bridge and Klarman, 1973; Brederodeet al., 1991; Conconi et al., 1996; Mert-Turk et al., 2003;Glawischnig, 2007); however, the ecological signi ﬁ- cance of these responses is not clear. The effect of natural levels of UV-B radiation boosting plant resistance to biotic stress has been linked with Figure 1. Solar UV-B radiation increases plant resistance to herbivo- rous insects in the ﬁeld. A, Fraction of published studies showing thatUV-B radiation reduced ( 2), increased (+), or did not affect (0) her- bivory levels or insect performance (adapted from Kuhlmann and Mu¨ller, 2011). B, Same as in A, but analysis restricted to studies that tested the effects of solar (ambient) UV-B radiation (i.e. excluding UV-Blamp supplementation studies). C, Quantitative relationship between solar UV-B attenuation and insect herbivory under ﬁeld conditions. UV-B attenuation, which was accomplished with plastic ﬁlms thatreduced the UV-B component of solar radiation with minimal effectson other wavelengths, increased the density of insect herbivores (Caliothrips phaseoli ) in a soybean canopy and damage caused by leaf beetles on Datura ferox plants. Zero percent attenuation corresponds to full sunlight. Primary data can be found in Ballare ´et al. (1996) and Mazza et al. (1999). 146 Plant Physiol.

Indirect evidence for a connection with JAresponses originated from the observation that plantexposure to solar UV-B can increase the expression of JA-responsive markers, such as proteinase inhibitors, in tomato ( Solanum lycopersicum ) and Nicotiana spp. (Stratmann et al., 2000; Izaguirre et al., 2003; Demkura et al., 2010). However, synergistic effects of UV-B and JA elicitation have not been observed for several classicmarkers of the JA response in Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ; Demkura and Ballaré, 2012). Similarly, mixed results have been obtained regarding the effects ofUV-B radiation on JA accumulation (A-H-Mackerness et al., 1999; Demkura et al., 2010). The strongest evi- dence for a role of JA in some defense responses trig-gered by natural doses of UV-B radiation comes fromstudies using mutants or transgenic lines impaired in JA biosynthesis or signaling. Disruption of the JA signaling pathway in Arabidopsis (Caputo et al., 2006)and Nicotiana attenuata (Demkura et al., 2010) was shown to eliminate the effect of solar UV-B inducing plant protection against herbivorous insects. In con-trast, a recent case was reported in which a positive effect of UV-B radiation on plant resistance against pathogens was conserved in JA-response mutants(Demkura and Ballaré, 2012), suggesting that UV-Bradiation likely in ﬂuences plant defense via multi- ple pathways. Soluble phenolic compounds typically accumulate in plants exposed to solar UV-B radiation and play a central role in photoprotection (Caldwell et al., 1983; Mazza et al., 2000; Kotilainen et al., 2009). Interest-ingly, it has been noted that some of the phenolic compounds that are induced by UV-B exposure are also induced by insect herbivory and other bioticstressors (Izaguirre et al., 2007; Demkura et al., 2010). The partial convergence in the induction of phenolic metabolites, and the fact that some of these com-pounds may have a role as defenses against pests andpathogens, have lent support to the idea that at least part of the effect of UV-B radiation on plant resistance to biotic stressors is mediated by the enhanced pro-duction of phenylpropanoid derivatives. For example, enhancement of JA- and insect-induced phenolic re- sponses by solar UV-B radiation has been documentedfor conjugated polyamines in N. attenuata (Demkura et al., 2010). Recent studies in this species have identi ﬁed MYB8 as a critical transcrip tion factor controlling poly- amine synthesis in response to herbivory (Onkokesunget al., 2012), and the MYB8 gene is known to be posi- tively regulated at the transcriptional level by UV-B radiation (Pandey and Baldwin, 2008). It is worthnoting that stress-speci ﬁc alterations in phenolic pro- ﬁles have also been reported (Demkura et al., 2010; Kuhlmann and Müller, 2011): for example, ﬂavonoids and sinapates typically accumulate in response to UV-B irradiation but not in response to herbivory or JA treatments (Demkura et al., 2010; Demkura andBallaré, 2012).The mechanism of perception of UV-B radiation is becoming increasingly elucidated (Jenkins, 2009; Heijde and Ulm, 2012), and a UV-B photoreceptor, UV-RESISTANCE LOCUS8 (UVR8), has been recentlycharacterized at the molecular level (Rizzini et al., 2011). UVR8 is a b-propeller protein that under UV- B-free light conditions exists as a homodimer. Absorptionof UV-B quanta by UVR8 induces instant monomerization of the photoreceptor, its accumulation in the nucleus, and interaction with the E3 ubiquitin ligase CONSTITU-TIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (Rizzini et al., 2011), which is required for UV-B-stimulated gene activation in light-grown seedlings (Oravecz et al., 2006). This increasedunderstanding of UV-B perce ption will greatly facilitate research on the mechanism by which UV-B radiation af- fects the expression of plant immune responses. Whereas the role of UVR8 in UV-B-induced gene expression is now well established (Jenkins, 2009; Heijde and Ulm, 2012), the participation of this pho- toreceptor in the activation of plant defenses againstbiotic stress requires further study. Conceivably, the effects of UV-B on plant defense might also result from pleiotropic consequences of UV-induced cellular dam-age and activation of a “generalized ”stress response (Brown and Jenkins, 2008; González Besteiro et al., 2011). Nevertheless, it is important to note that, underﬁeld conditions, strong impacts on plant defense and health are induced by relatively low UV-B irradiances (less than 1% of the total short-wave sunlight photon ﬂux), which do not cause visible stress symptoms or plant damage (discussed in Demkura et al., 2010). Therefore, a speci ﬁc, photoreceptor-activated signaling pathway is likely to be involved in the regulation ofplant immunity by UV-B radiation. Recently, activation of UVR8 was linked to the pro- duction of chemicals involved in plant defense against pathogens (Demkura and Ballaré, 2012; Fig. 2). Small, ecologically meaningful doses of UV-B radiation (ap- proximately 1 mmol m22s21:l.290 nm) were shown to increase the resistance of Arabidopsis plants tothe necrotrophic fungus Botrytis cinerea in a UVR8- dependent manner. The same study showed that UVR8 was required for UV-B-induced accumulation ofsinapates (sinapoyl malate and sinapoyl Glc) and that the UV-B effect on fungal resistance was absent in fah1, a mutant de ﬁcient in ferulic acid 5-hydroxylase, which is essential for sinapate biosynthesis. Sinapates are important precursors in the synthesis of syringyl- type ( “defense ”) lignin, which is used to strengthen the plant cell walls and prevent penetration by fungalhyphae (Lloyd et al., 2011). Collectively, these results indicate that UVR8 plays an important role in medi- ating the effects of solar UV-B radiation on pathogenresistance by controlling the expression of the sinapate biosynthetic pathway. The UV-B effect on plant resis- tance to B. cinerea was conserved in transparent testa4 (deﬁcient in chalcone synthase), which suggests that this effect is likely independent of UV-B-induced ﬂa- vonoid accumulation (Demkura and Ballaré, 2012).However, it is important to note that ﬂavonoid Plant Physiol. Vol. 160, 2012 147L i g h ta n dP l a n tH e a l t hDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/160/1/145/6109753 by guest on 09 February 2024 biosynthesis is also controlled by UVR8 (Jenkins, 2009) and that ﬂavonoids can play a role in plant defense against insect herbivores (Hoffmann-Campo et al.,2001). Studies under arti ﬁcial laboratory conditions show that cellular responses triggered by microbe- associated molecular patterns (such as the ﬂagellin- derived elicitor peptide ﬂg22) can depress ﬂavonoid responses triggered by UV-B radiation, presumably to save phenylpropanoid precursors for the synthesis of lignin and other antimicrobial compounds (Schenkeet al., 2011; Serrano et al., 2012). If corroborated in the ﬁeld, these studies suggest the potential for signi ﬁcant interactions between different biotic stressors (e.g.pathogens and herbivores) mediated by the regulation of plant responses to UV-B radiation. The UVR8 pathway has not been directly linked with the regulation of any of the principal hormonalpathways involved in plant defense (i.e. JA and salic- ylate [SA]) as of yet. Demkura and Ballaré (2012) showed that the UVR8 effect on Arabidopsis resistancetoB. cinerea was independent of JA signaling, but be- cause interactions between natural levels of UV-Bradiation and JA-induced responses have been reported in other studies (see above), further work is needed to establish the in ﬂuence of UVR8 activation on the reg- ulation of defense signaling pathways. As discussed previously, increased crop density has strong effects reducing the penetration of sunlight (including UV-B) into the canopy. The extent to whichsuch a reduction in UV-B radiation affects plant de- fense needs to be quanti ﬁed. All studies to date that manipulated UV-B levels have used ﬁlters placed above the canopy, which do not strictly mimic the ef- fects of neighboring plants on the UV-B ﬂuxes received by different plant organs. In spite of these limitations,recent UV-B exclusion experiments carried out with soybean ( Glycine max ) crops demonstrated that the well-documented negative effect of solar UV-B radia-tion on crop yield was reversed when soybean pestswere not controlled by pesticide applications (Mazza et al., 2012). This observation suggests that natural levels of UV-B radiation may have a signi ﬁcant effect protecting crop plants from insect pests under ﬁeld conditions, presumably through mechanisms involv- ing UV-B-induced enhancement of plant defenses. Thepotential value of capitalizing on plants ’natural re- sponses to increased defenses with exposure to solar UV-B radiation should not be underestimated andcould serve as a starting point for strategic crop im-provement for maximizing these natural defense mech- anisms. Moreover, some of the compounds that are induced by ambient levels of UV-B radiation, such asphenolic compounds (Mazza et al., 2000; Wargent et al., 2006; Berli et al., 2008) and antioxidants (Giordano et al., 2004), may have nutraceutical and organolepticvalue (Jansen et al., 2008; Schreiner et al., 2012). There- fore, in horticultural crops, manipulation of plant re- sponses to solar UV-B radiation could have signi ﬁcant implications for food quality. RED TO FAR-RED RATIO AND PHYTOCHROME B The red (R) to far-red (FR) ratio (R:FR) of sunlight is a critical environmental signal for plants. Low valuesof R:FR indicate the proximity of other plants, because plant tissues strongly absorb R photons, while FR quanta are either re ﬂected or transmitted (Ballaré et al., 1990). In crop canopies, the R:FR of horizontally propagated radiation is directly related to the LAI of the plant stand. Plants sense the changes in R:FR usingthe phytochromes, particularly phytochrome B (phyB).Low R:FR values inactivate phyB by transforming the active form of the photoreceptor, Pfr, into the inactive from, Pr (Smith, 1995). Upon inactivation of phyB,basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors known as phytochrome-interacting factors accumulate in a dephosphorylated form and activate the expressionof growth-promoting genes (Lorrain et al., 2008; Hornitschek et al., 2012; Li et al., 2012). This tran- scriptional reprogramming leads to increased produc-tion and activity of growth hormones such as auxins Figure 2. UV-B radiation increases Arabidopsis resistance to the necrotrophic pathogen B. cinerea ; this effect is mediated by UVR8 via increases in sinapate accumulation. Original data can be found inDemkura and Ballare ´(2012). A, Damage by B. cinerea in plants grown with exposure to UV-B radiation relative to damage in control plants grown under UV-B-free conditions for wild type (WT) ecotype Co- lumbia (Col-0) plants and mutants deﬁcient in UV-B perception ( uvr8-6 ; Favory et al., 2009) and sinapate biosynthesis ( fah1-7 ; Meyer et al., 1996). B, UV-B induces the accumulation of phenolic sunscreens (mostly ﬂavonoids and sinapates) in a UVR8-dependent manner. Sunscreen accumulation is revealed here by a decrease in the intensityof UV-induced chlorophyll ﬂuorescence. Blue color indicates higher accumulation of phenolic compounds. 148 Plant Physiol. Vol. 160, 2012Ballaré et al.Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/160/1/145/6109753 by guest on 09 February 2024 and GAs, which accelerate cell expansion and promote the elongation of stems and petioles (Djakovic-Petrovic et al., 2007; Tao et al., 2008; Keuskamp et al., 2010;Hornitschek et al., 2012; Li et al., 2012). For plants, afast rate of elongation is essential for rapid colonization of the upper canopy strata and a central element of a suite of phenotypic changes that are collectively knownas the shade-avoidance syndrome (SAS; Franklin, 2008; Ballaré, 2009). Whereas R:FR, perceived by phyB, plays a well- known role in neighbor detection and the elicitation of adaptive morphological responses (Ballaré, 1999; Dorn et al., 2000), its role as a modulator of defense expres-sion is only beginning to be appreciated. A high R:FR (typical of open canopies) is a positive regulator of plant defense against herbivorous insects. Experiments withcucumber ( Cucumis sativus ), tomato, N. attenuata ,a n d Arabidopsis demonstrate that inactivation of phyB, ei- ther by mutation or by exposing the plants to supple- mental FR to lower the R:FR, decreases plant resistanceto herbivory (McGuire and Agrawal, 2005; Izaguirre et al., 2006; Moreno et al., 2009; Fig. 3). Down-regulation of the expression of antiherbivory traits under low R:FRhas been proposed to be a key element in the mecha- nism by which plants resolve the tradeoff between re- source allocation to growth or defense (i.e. the “dilemma ” of plants; Ballaré, 2009; Moreno et al., 2009). The effect of variations of R:FR on resistance to mi- crobial pathogens has received little attention until re- cently. Previous studies with a variety of horticulturalspecies have shown that treatment of leaves with R stimulates plant resistance to a number of pathogens, compared with leaves incubated in the dark or visiblelight of other wavelengths (Islam et al., 1998, 2002). However, because the control for the R treatment was not established as a low-R:FR treatment, the results aredifﬁcult to interpret in terms of plant ecology and spe- ciﬁc phytochrome action. In fact, some of the protective effects of R in those experiments have been attributed tothe stimulation of photosynthesis (Rahman et al., 2002).Very recent studies have shown that plants exposed to low R:FR values (R:FR ,1), which were designed to mimic realistic competition scenarios, are more sus-ceptible to subsequent infection by necrotrophic path- ogens (such as B. cinerea ) than plants exposed to white light (R:FR .1; Cerrudo et al., 2012; De Wit, 2012; Fig. 3). Similarly, phyB mutants of Arabidopsis were found to be more susceptible to necrotrophs than the corresponding wild types (Kazan and Manners, 2011;Cerrudo et al., 2012). Recent experiments demonstrate that low-R:FR treatments also reduce Arabidopsis re- sistance to the hemibiotrophic pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pvtomato DC3000 (M. De Wit and R. Pierik, unpublished data), which is consistent with the sus- ceptibility phenotype of phyB mutants in P. syringae bioassays (Faigón-Soverna et al., 2006; Fig. 3). More-over, in these experiments (De Wit, 2012; De Wit and Pierik, unpublished data), the effect of low R:FR de- pressing plant resistance to the pathogen was observedeven if the change in light conditions (from high to low R:FR) was applied concomitantly with the in- fection treatment. The mechanisms by which variations in R:FR regu- late plant resistance to pests and pathogens have been connected with modulation effects of phyB Pfr on the signaling networks activated by the major defensehormones JA and SA. R:FR and JA Shading by a forest leaf canopy, which reduces both total irradiance and R:FR, can reduce JA production Figure 3. FR supplementation treatments, designed to mimic the proximity of neighboringplants, or mutational inactivation of the PHYB gene increase the levels of insect herbivory and disease severity in a variety of herbaceous spe-cies. Concentric circles indicate the level of en-hancement (fold increase) of plant susceptibility to attack, expressed as a ratio between the treat- ment (low R:FR or phyB ) and control (high R:FR, PHYB ) conditions. Plant susceptibility was esti- mated on the basis of bioassay results that mea- sured the growth of the consumer organism or the severity of plant damage.

Furthermore, even in the absence of shading (i.e. at constant levels ofphotosynthetically active radiation [PAR]), the reduc-tion of R:FR caused by the proximity of neighboring plants in an even-height canopy can depress plant re- sponses to JA (Moreno et al., 2009). This effect of lowR:FR is mediated by the inactivation of phyB and has been demonstrated at the level of gene expression (Moreno et al., 2009; Suzuki et al., 2011; Cerrudo et al.,2012; De Wit, 2012) and the accumulation of secondary metabolites likely to be involved in direct defense against pathogens and pests, such as phenylpropanoids,anthocyanins, and glucosinolates (Izaguirre et al., 2006; Moreno et al., 2009; Cerrudo et al., 2012; Fig. 4). The mechanisms that link phyB Pfr with JA signal- ing are not completely clear and are likely to involveseveral layers of regulation (Ballaré, 2011). Perception of jasmonoyl-Ile, the bioactive amino acid conjugate of jasmonic acid, is achieved by a coreceptor formedby the ubiquitin ligase SCF COI1(for S-phase kinase- associated protein1-Cu llin1-F-box protein CORO- NATINE INSENSITIVE1) complex and JASMONATEZIM DOMAIN (JAZ) proteins (for review, see Browse, 2009). Jasmonoyl-Ile stimulates the speci ﬁc binding of COI1 and JAZ proteins, which leads to the ubiquiti-nation of JAZs by SCF COI1and their subsequent deg- radation by the 26S proteasome (Chini et al., 2007; Thines et al., 2007; Yan et al., 2007, 2009; Melotto et al., 2008; Pauwels et al., 2010; Sheard et al., 2010). JAZproteins are repressors of JA-responsive transcription factors; therefore, degradation of JAZ proteins initiates the activation of the JA response (Pauwels and Goossens,2011; Shyu et al., 2012). Regulation of plant defense by phyB has been recently linked to JAZ activity, because the effect of low R:FR values reducing Arab-idopsis resistance to B. cinerea was found to be signif- icantly attenuated in a jaz10 null mutant and in RNA interference lines disrupted for the expression of theJAZ10 gene (Cerrudo et al., 2012). A possible mecha- nism behind this connection may be based on phyB- mediated changes in JAZ gene expression or JAZ protein stability. Increased expression of certain JAZ genes has been observed in response to low R:FR values (Moreno et al., 2009). A phytochrome effect on JAZ stability has been demonstrated for phytochromeA (phyA). Thus, COI1-mediated degradation of JAZ1 in response to JA treatment was found to require active phyA (Robson et al., 2010). However, it remains to bedemonstrated whether in fully deetiolated plants,where responses to low R:FR are controlled predomi- nantly by phyB (Ballaré, 1999), changes in the levels of phyB Pfr in response to R:FR affect the turnover of JAZrepressors. In addition to Pfr effects on some of the early JA signaling components, light quality perceived by phyBcould affect JA responses by affecting the levels of other hormones known to regulate JA signaling, and the list of these regulators includes GAs, brassinoste-roids (BRs), and SA, among others (Bari and Jones,2009; Ballaré, 2011; Erb et al., 2012; Pieterse et al., 2012). SA has been dismissed as a potential mediatorof the effect of low R:FR values on JA signaling by studies demonstrating that this effect is conserved in SA synthesis and signaling mutants (Cerrudo et al.,2012). GAs are important growth-promoting hormones during SAS, accumulating in response to neighbor proximity and low R:FR values and participating inthe elongation response (Djakovic-Petrovic et al.,2007). GAs can antagonize certain JA responses (Navarro et al., 2008), and this action is mediated by their effect on the DELLA proteins (Hou et al., 2010).GA perception leads to DELLA degradation in the proteasome (Hirano et al., 2008), and DELLAs are positive regulators of the JA response, as they preventthe repressive action of JAZ proteins on JA signaling (Hou et al., 2010). Whether the increased DELLA turnover caused by low R:FR values in canopies(Djakovic-Petrovic et al., 2007) is responsible for thedepression in JA-mediated chemical defenses at high density has not been explicitly tested. BRs were re- cently found to participate in the orchestration of theSAS phenotype induced by low R:FR values in Arab- idopsis (Kozuka et al., 2010). Interestingly, BRs have also been shown to antagonize JA-mediated growthand antiherbivore responses (Campos et al., 2009; Ren et al., 2009) and to modulate the ef ﬁciency of plant Figure 4.

BRI1-ASSOCIATED KINASE1 (BAK1) is aBR coreceptor and also physically interacts with the ﬂg22 receptor FLS2, positively regulating FLS2-mediated innate immunity in Arabidopsis (Chinchilla et al., 2009). In N. attenuata , BAK1 is a positive regulator of herbivory-induced JA accumulation and also a nega- tive modulator of certain defense responses elicited by JA (Yang et al., 2011). Clearly, further work is neededto assess the effects of changes in BR signaling elicited by low R:FR values on the modulation of plant defense responses in dense canopies. R:FR and SA SA plays a major role in disease resistance signaling (Durrant and Dong, 2004; Vlot et al., 2009). The SAresponse pathway is typically effective against micro-bial pathogens with a biotrophic lifestyle (Glazebrook, 2005). Light, when compared with dark conditions, increases plant resistance to a variety of biotrophicpathogens (Zeier et al., 2004), and SA accumulation in healthy Arabidopsis plants has been shown to increase in response to increased PAR (Karpinski et al., 2003).Recent experiments with cucumber suggested that light-enhanced resistance may be speci ﬁc for R, since other light treatments were less effective in reducingdamage by Sphaerotheca fuliginea (powdery mildew) as compared with R irradiation (Wang et al., 2010). Infected plants responded with increased free SAlevels, and this response, together with the inductionof a range of SA-responsive genes, was enhanced in R as compared with other wavelengths (Wang et al., 2010). The apparently speci ﬁc effects of R suggest the involvement of phytochromes. Indeed, phy mutants have reduced SA-mediated resistance against (hemi) biotrophic pathogens. Thus, the Arabidopsis phyB mutant allows stronger proliferation of an avirulent P. syringae strain (Faigón-Soverna et al., 2006), and phyAphyB double mutants are impaired in SA-dependent systemic responses and more susceptible to pathogenswith a biotrophic lifestyle (Genoud et al., 2002; Griebel and Zeier, 2008). Interestingly, defense responses at the direct sites of P. syringae inoculation appear to be mostly phytochrome independent (Griebel and Zeier, 2008). Triple phyAphyBphyC mutants of rice ( Oryza sativa ) were also shown to be more susceptible to blast fungus ( Magnaporthe grisea ) than the cv Nipponbare wild type (Xie et al., 2011). Consistent with enhanced susceptibility to this fungus, the phyAphyBphyC mu- tant showed reduced induction of PATHOGENESIS- RELATED1 gene expression in response to SA spray treatment (Xie et al., 2011). Recent studies in Arabi-dopsis indicate that low-R:FR treatments that simulateneighbor proximity also lead to enhanced susceptibil- ity to P. syringae and reduced defense gene induction in response to SA treatment (De Wit, 2012; De Wit andPierik, unpublished data). Collectively, these resultsindicate that phyB Pfr is a positive regulator of SA- mediated defense responses. The mechanism of SA perception has been clari ﬁed only very recently (Fu et al., 2012), and the signaling networks that connectphyB and SA signaling are at present largely un- known. The fact that phyB inactivation depresses both JA and SA responses suggests that the effect of lowR:FR values on plant defense does not result from a simple shift of balance between different immune branches. Elucidation of the molecular links betweenlight and defense signaling might reveal new connec- tions between defense hormone pathways. PAR, PHOTOSYNTHESIS, AND BLUE LIGHT RECEPTORS Chloroplast-derived signals can also modulate de- fense responses, although a clear picture of the adap- tive signi ﬁcance of this regulation under canopy light conditions is not yet available (Karpinski et al., 2003;Kangasjärvi et al., 2012). Similarly, the role of blue light (B) and B photoreceptors in the regulation of defense responses is not well established. Jeong et al. (2010)reported that cryptochrome 2 and phototropin 2 are speciﬁcally required for resistance protein-mediated Arabidopsis defense against Turnip crinkle virus . There Figure 5. Schematic representation of the positive effects of light sig- nals of open space (high R:FR and UV-B) on plant health. UV-B affects plant resistance to insects and necrotrophic pathogens via mechanismsthat involve interactions with JA signaling and JA-independent in-creases in the levels of certain phenolic compounds, the latter being mediated by UVR8. High R:FR values act through phyB increasing plant responses to JA and SA. Dashed lines indicate interactions thathave not been explicitly demonstrated. For further explanation, see text.

However, other studies, carried out under day/night light cycles, failed to detect any effects of mutations in B photoreceptors on Arabidopsis resis-tance to this bacterial path ogen (Griebel and Zeier, 2008; Jeong et al., 2010). Moreover, cry1 mutants did not show any obvious susceptibility phenotypein bioassays with the necrotrophic fungus B. cinerea (Cerrudo et al., 2012). Therefore, while the participa- tion of cryptochromes in the regulation of SAS re-sponses at high planting density is well documented (Pierik et al., 2004, 2009; Sellaro et al., 2010; Keller et al., 2011; Keuskamp et al., 2011), the effects of var-iations of B levels caused by the proximity of neigh-bors on plant immune responses requires further study. CONCLUSION In order to achieve elevated yields per unit area, plants must be grown at high density, but increasing crop density and LAI may have negative effects onplant resistance to pests and diseases that are remi-niscent of the effects of sunlight deprivation on human health. There is now ample evidence that light, and light signals associated with open space, are positiveregulators of plant defense against a broad spectrum of enemies via mechanisms triggered by speci ﬁc photo- receptors for UV-B and R:FR (Fig. 5). From an evolu-tionary perspective, this bene ﬁcial effect of light might reﬂect the activity of an optimization strategy that distributes limited resources between growth and de-fense as a function of the risk of competition that the plant senses using its photoreceptors (Ballaré, 2009). Whether the plant ’s solution to this dilemma could be manipulated in species of economic interest to reducepesticide loads without greatly forfeiting crop yields requires further investigation. The molecular mechanisms that mediate the effects of photoreceptor signals modulating the expression of plant defenses are beginning to be elucidated. Under- standing these mechanisms may allow us to manipu-late planting density and canopy structure to optimize light penetration for improved crop health. In addi- tion, this understanding will provide key functionalinformation for the design of crop varieties that main-tain elevated levels of defense even at high planting density. In this regard, the rapid growth that we have witnessed in the last few years in the ﬁeld of regula- tion of plant immunity suggests that, in the not very distant future, we will be able to identify targets for biotechnological manipulation to improve crop healthat high LAI. These strategies may help us design agro- ecosystems that safely deliver healthy products to meet the nutritional demands of humankind in thefollowing decades.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank Patricia Demkura, Mieke De Wit, and Mercedes Keller for helpful discussions and Patricia Demkura for providing the ﬂuorescence image for Figure 2B.

"Wei et al., Sci. Adv. 2019; 5 : eaaw0759     25 September 2019 SCIENCE ADVANCES | RESEARCH ARTICLE1 of 11PLANT SCIENCES Initial soil microbiome composition and functioning  predetermine future plant health Zhong Wei1*, Yian Gu1,2*, Ville-Petri Friman1,3, George A. Kowalchuk1,4, Yangchun Xu1†,  Qirong Shen1†, Alexandre Jousset1,4 Plant-pathogen interactions are shaped by multiple environmental factors, making it difficult to predict disease  dynamics even in relatively simple agricultural monocultures. Here, we explored how variation in the initial soil  microbiome predicts future disease outcomes at the level of individual plants. We found that the composition and  functioning of the initial soil microbiome predetermined whether the plants survived or succumbed to disease.  Surviving plant microbiomes were associated with specific rare taxa, highly pathogen-suppressing Pseudomonas  and Bacillus bacteria, and high abundance of genes encoding antimicrobial compounds. Microbiome-mediated  plant protection could subsequently be transferred to the next plant generation via soil transplantation. Together,  our results suggest that small initial variation in soil microbiome composition and functioning can determine the  outcomes of plant-pathogen interactions under natural field conditions. INTRODUCTION Crop loss to plant pathogens is an ever-increasing threat for agricultural  production. While production demands increase, there is a pressing  need to reduce the use of environmentally unfriendly pesticides and  agrochemicals (1 ). To achieve this, manipulation of the plant micro- biomes has been suggested as a viable alternative to reduce disease  levels by, for example, improving microbe-mediated pathogen sup- pression (2 ) and priming the plant immune system (3 ). However,  we still poorly understand how the complex interactions between  plants, their pathogens, and soil microbiota determine disease develop- ment under natural field conditions. In particular, separating stochastic  and deterministic drivers is challenging because disease outcomes  are affected by multiple factors including population density dynamics  (4), the genetic background of the pathogen (5 ) and the host (6 ),  temporal and spatial variation in biotic and abiotic conditions (7),  and the composition and assembly of the host-associated microbiome  (8). Considerable spatial variation in disease dynamics exists even  in relatively homogenous agricultural monocultures that are exposed  to similar stochastic and temporal environmental variation locally  (9, 10). This suggests that local spatial variation within agricultural  fields could be important in determining the outcome of plant-   pathogen interactions, thereby raising the question “To what extent  does the initial microbiome composition and functioning determine  variation in disease incidence across plant individuals?” To examine this question, we used a newly developed rhizobox  system that allows for nondestructive repeated sampling of individual  plants (tomatoes in this case) at different growth stages under natural  field conditions (Fig. 1A and fig. S1A). Although repeated sampling  has previously been applied for studying plant-soil interactions (11), nondestructive repeated sampling of plant rhizosphere microbiomes  enables sampling of the same plant individuals in time. This time series  approach is similar to medical cohort studies, where individuals are  repeatedly sampled at distinct time scales throughout their life cycle  (12). We used soil-borne plant pathogenic Ralstonia solanacearum  bacterium as our focal pathogen and tomato plants as model hosts  on a field that had been naturally infected by R. solanacearum for  more than15 years. This pathogen is a causal agent of bacterial wilt  disease that is able to infect numerous economically important crops  and is a very severe pathogen globally and especially in China and  Asia (13). Three replicate plots with 16 tomato plants in each were  established under natural field conditions, and each plant was grown  in a rhizobox (fig. S1B) filled with local soil to retain natural physico- chemical conditions and microbial community structure. Three  individual rhizosphere samples were nondestructively collected  from each plant at every sampling time point (Fig. 1B and movie  S1), including initial soil microbiome samples before planting of  tomatoes (to assess the local soil species pool including pathogen  without plant influence) and spanning the full vegetative period to  track changes in microbiome assembly and pathogen growth at the  level of individual plants (Fig. 1, C and D). All samples were kept  frozen (−80°C), and soil collection was terminated at week 6 after  disease dynamics were allowed to stabilize for one additional week.  The number of healthy and diseased plants found in different repli- cate plots varied, and the average disease incidence reached 54% by  the end of the experiment (26 wilted, 12 healthy, and 10 latently in - fected plants; fig. S1, B to D). Bacterial wilt is commonly characterized by  symptomless latent infections (14) due to differences in the develop- ment of bacterial wilt disease or due to variation in systemic plant resis- tance induced by soil microbiota (15). In this study, we focused only on  clearly determinable disease outcomes and hence randomly selected  12 plants that remained healthy and 12 plants that succumbed to  disease for further analysis. We aimed to answer three main questions:  (i) to what extent do initial differences in rhizosphere bacterial com- munities predict the future disease outcomes? (ii) Does bacterial com- munity assembly during the tomato plant growth affect disease  development? (iii) What are the underlying taxonomic and func- tional differences between diseased and healthy rhizosphere micro- biomes? To achieve these aims, we analyzed all samples repeatedly 1Jiangsu Provincial Key Lab for Organic Solid Waste Utilization, Jiangsu Collaborative  Innovation Center for Solid Organic Waste Resource Utilization, National Engineering  Research Center for Organic-based Fertilizers, Nanjing Agricultural University,  Weigang 1, Nanjing, 210095, P.R.

At the beginning of the experiment, we also analyzed the  initial physicochemical properties of soil samples in each rhizobox. RESULTS Linking initial differences in microbiomes with future  disease outcomes The initial variation in pathogen abundances, soil physicochemical  properties, total bacterial densities, bacterial community diversity  (table S1 and fig. S2), or plant location within plots (fig. S3) could  not predict whether plants remained healthy or became infected by  the pathogen over the course of the experiment. However, the initial  soil bacterial community composition clustered into two distinct  groups that corresponded well with plants that remained healthy or  became diseased later during the experiment [analysis of molecular  variance (AMOVA) on unweighted UniFrac, P < 0.001, Fig. 2B]. In  particular, future plant survival was associated with a set of rare  bacterial taxa present in the initial microbiome (figs. S4 and S5A),  and a total of 46 and 53 unique operational taxonomic units (OTUs)  were found to be closely associated with plants that remained healthy and became diseased, respectively (figs. S5, B and C, and S6). Of these  discriminating OTUs, the initial soils that were later associated with  healthy plants had higher abundances of Alphaproteobacteria,  Firmicutes, and Cyanobacteria, while initial soils that were later asso - ciated with diseased plants had higher abundances of Acidobacteria,  Actinobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia (week 0; Fig. 2C and data file S1).  The co-occurrence networks of healthy plants were initially much  larger, having higher number of nodes and edges, longer average  path lengths, and higher modularity compared to the initial networks  of diseased plants (Fig. 2D and table S2). On the basis of “NetShift”  analysis, we were able to link Massilia, Dyadobacter, Terrabacter,  Arachidicoccus, and Dyella genera as potential keystone taxa behind  pathogen suppression in the initial microbiomes of healthy plants  (Fig. 2E). At the functional level, plants that remained healthy were  initially associated with microbiomes with relatively high levels of  functional genes (Fig. 2F) linked to nonribosomal peptide and  polyketide synthases (Fig. 2G and data file S2). These functions are  responsible for the production of potent antimicrobial compounds,  which may either directly inhibit the pathogen or contribute to the  assembly of a pathogen-suppressing microbiome (16). Bacillus,  Pseudomonas, and Actinobacteria represent the best-described pro- ducers of nonribosomal antimicrobial peptides and polyketides (17,  18).  However, their abundances were not correlated with the relative  Week 0 Week 3W eek 4W eek 5W eek 6 Weeks after planting Nylon bag with homogeniz ed  steriliz ed soil Initial field  soil microbiomeAffected by  root ex udates Week 3W eek 6A B DC 50-µm n ylon net 150-µm ny lon ba g 4-mm metal net Fig. 1.

Adv. 2019; 5 : eaaw0759     25 September 2019 SCIENCE ADVANCES | RESEARCH ARTICLE4 of 11differences in the initial soil microbiomes can predetermine whether  the plants later survive or succumb to bacterial wilt disease. Tracking changes in microbiome composition, diversity,  and functioning during plant growth and comparing soil  suppressiveness in the second plant generation We next explored whether the initial differences in the taxonomic  and functional soil microbiome composition changed during the plant  development (Fig. 3). We found that the healthy and diseased plants  harbored distinct microbiomes throughout the experiment (fig. S8),  even though the microbiome composition tended to converge toward  the end of the experiment (Fig. 3A), possibly due to plant root exudate– induced changes in microbiome composition and modification of  plant endosphere (19,  20). Most of the rare taxa associated with the  initial soil microbiome of healthy plants were rapidly replaced, while  the rare taxa associated with the initial soil microbiome of diseased  plants persisted or even increased in abundance toward the end of  the experiment (Fig. 3B and figs. S9 and S10). This suggests that  initially rare discriminating taxa likely played a transient role in  healthy plant microbiomes and a more persistent role in diseased plant  microbiomes. Rare taxa associated with healthy plants could have driven  priority effects in microbiome assembly during the early stages of  plant development (21), either leading to more suppressive bacterial  communities (22) or by priming the plant immune system (20). In  contrast, the rare taxa associated with diseased plants could have even  facilitated the pathogen, thereby potentially promoting infections  (23, 24). Further studies are, however, needed to directly test and verify  these hypotheses. At later phases of plant development, higher abun- dances of discriminating Acidobacteria and unclassified bacterial taxa  were found in healthy plant microbiomes and higher abundances of  discriminating Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Betaproteobacteria  taxa were found in diseased plant microbiomes (week 6; Fig. 3C and  data file S3). Similar to initial soil samples, healthy plant microbi - omes were still associated with larger co-occurrence networks with  higher number of nodes and edges and longer average path lengths  compared to diseased plants (Fig. 3D and table S2). However, dif- ferences between the networks were less pronounced at the end of the  experiment compared to the initial samples. On the basis of NetShift  analysis, Gp16 (Acidobacteria), Spartobacteria_genera_incertae_ sedis, Dyella, Hyphomicrobium, and Sphingomonas were identified as  keystone genera associated with pathogen suppression in the healthy  plant microbiomes (Fig. 3E). We also found that healthy and diseased  plant microbiomes converged from a perspective of functional genes over  the course of the experiment (Fig. 3F and fig. S11). However, some spe- cific functional characteristics, such as the high abundance of polyketide  synthases genes, remained higher in healthy plant microbiomes  throughout the experiment (Fig. 3G and data file S4), which suggests  that they potentially retained their capability to suppress the pathogen. To confirm this, we tested whether the microbial communities  isolated at the end of the experiment could provide protection  against the pathogen in the next plant generation by conducting  “soil transplantation” experiments. We found that soils derived from  the “first-generation” healthy plants had 20.8% lower disease incidence  compared to soils derived from the first-generation diseased plants  (P = 0.002, t = −5, df = 6, Student’s t test; Fig. 3H). No significant  difference (P  = 0.78, t  = 0.29, df = 6, Student’s t  test; Fig. 3H) in  disease incidence was observed between soils derived from the first-  generation diseased plants (75 to 91.7% of disease incidence) and  healthy plant soils that had their microbiome removed by sterilization (75 to 100% of disease incidence). Together, these results suggest that  the initial differences in soil microbiome composition and functioning  persisted throughout the plant development and could be carried  over to subsequent plant generations. DISCUSSION Host-associated microbiomes have repeatedly been observed to vary  between healthy and diseased individuals with plants and humans  (25, 26). It has, however, remained unclear whether these differences  are the cause or consequence of disease development. Previous studies  on mammals have proposed that early-life microbiomes may be  connected with the future health of individuals (12). However, direct,  causal evidence is still scarce (27,  28). By using a repeated sampling  of individual tomato plants that either remained healthy or got infected  by soil-borne plant pathogenic R. solanacearum bacterium, we demon- strate that initial differences in the local bacterial species pool can  predetermine the outcome of host-pathogen interactions long before  the onset of disease outbreaks. We found no difference in the soil physicochemical properties  between initial microbiomes that later became associated with healthy  and diseased plants. This suggests that local variation in abiotic en- vironmental conditions within replicate plots was an unlikely driver  of differential disease outcomes. Initial community assembly could  also have been affected by priority effects during early stages of the  experiment when rhizoboxes were transferred to the field (29).  However, we did not find phylum-level differences between the initial  bulk soil samples and 5-day-old microbiome samples, which origi- nally contained soil sterilized by gamma radiation (fig. S12A). This  suggests that rhizoboxes were rapidly colonized by bacteria from  the surrounding local environment. While priority effects were not  observed to play an important role for the initial microbiome as- sembly, the microbiomes of 5-day-old samples clustered between  soils that later became associated with healthy and diseased plants  (fig. S12B), indicative of substantial and strong initial differences.  Together, these results suggest that bacterial wilt disease develop- ment was highly predictable based on initial differences in bacterial  community composition and functional capacity even under tem- porally varying field conditions. Even though no clear differences were found at the phylum level,  we found that certain taxa could clearly discriminate between plant  microbiomes that later became associated with healthy and diseased  plants. Specifically, previous studies have linked these taxa to  pathogen suppression (7,  30) and, for example, Actinobacteria has  been shown to be linked to bacteria-mediated suppression of Fusarium   wilt at a continental scale (31). One potential mechanism behind  the suppression could be the production of antibiotics, and in support  of this, we found that initial microbiomes associated with healthy  plants had high levels of functional genes linked to nonribosomal  peptide and polyketide synthases. While the abundance of the genes  was not significantly associated with any specific taxa, they were  linked to more antagonistic Bacillus and Pseudomonas bacteria iso - lated from the initial microbiome samples that were later associated  with healthy plants. We also found that certain other bacterial taxa  (Massilia, Dyadobacter, Terrabacter, Arachidicoccus, and Dyella genera)  could have played a key role in driving the infection in the rhizo- sphere. Even though we could not isolate these taxa, it has previously  been shown that Massilia and Dyadobacter have been associated  with soils that can suppress Fusarium wilt (32,  33), while Terrabacter   Downloaded from https://www.science.org on February 08, 2024 Wei et al., Sci. Adv. 2019; 5 : eaaw0759     25 September 2019 SCIENCE ADVANCES | RESEARCH ARTICLE5 of 11and Dyella have been linked to the suppression of wheat diseases  (34, 35). These clear differences in microbiome composition and  functioning were not correlated with differences in the initial pathogen  abundances, which became clearer only toward the very end of the experiment. One explanation for this finding is that bacteria were  less active in the beginning of the experiment when the tomatoes  were still relatively small, providing only a small amount of root  exudate for bacterial growth and secondary metabolism (36).Healthy soilDiseased soil Sterilized soilDisease incidence (%)020406080100aa bR2 = 0.42, P < 0.0001 Weeks after planting03 45 6UniFrac distance of healthy vs diseased 0.360.400.440.480.52 03 45 6Sum of relative abundance of screened OTUs (%) 012345678 DiseasedHealthy R2 = 0.22, P < 0.0001 R2 = 0.81, P < 0.0001More different More similarAB HWeeks after planting Soil collected at Week 6C Week 6 PC1 (30.6%)PC2 (18.3%) 0.0004 0.0000 −0.00040.0004 0.0000 −0.00040.0002 −0.0002Healthy Diseased Adonis:  P = 0.084Week 6 COG3315O-Meth yltransferase involved in polyk etide biosynthesis NOG69913 NOG56472 0.0 0.3 Mean propor tion of  functional genes (% )Week 6 *** * *Phytanoy l-CoA dioxygenase Male ylacetoaceta te isomeras eF G Healthy DiseasedProteobacteria UnclassifiedAcidobacteria BacteroidetesActinobacteria Firmicutes Gemma timonadetes Planctom ycetes Verrucomicrobia Others Positiv e interactions Nega tive interactions Ohtaekw angia Dyadobacter Cytophaga Arachidicoccus Gp2AquicellaMucilaginibacter Arthrobacter Candidatus Solibacter Parafilimonas PedobacterPseudomonasSolirubrobacter Unclassified Gemma timonas Conexibact er Gp7 Flavobac teriumAcidothermusNitrospiraTer rabacte rNocardioidesBradyrhizobi umCh rys eolin eaGp4Gp 3 Subdivision3_genera_...

Adv. 2019; 5 : eaaw0759     25 September 2019 SCIENCE ADVANCES | RESEARCH ARTICLE6 of 11We found that initial differences in the composition of microbiomes  associated with healthy and diseased plants persisted throughout the  field experiment. However, we did observe slight convergence in  community composition and functioning between healthy and diseased  plants, which was likely due to similar effects imposed on microbiota  by the same tomato cultivars. Discriminating bacterial taxa that  could initially separate healthy and diseased microbiomes was lost  during the tomato growth, and the taxa associated with healthy and  diseased plants changed considerably. Even though the healthy soils  were still associated with increased number of functional genes linked  to antibiotic production, only the Dyella genus was still associated as  a potential driver taxon behind R. solanacearum suppression based  on our network analyses. Instead, Gp16 (Acidobacteria), Spartobacteria_ genera_incertae_sedis, Hyphomicrobium, and Sphingomonas were  associated as potential driver taxa behind pathogen suppression  in the healthy plant microbiomes at the end of the experiment. Of these  taxa, the Sphingomonadaceae and Spartobacteria have previously  been linked to R. solanacearum–driven bacterial wilt infections  (37), while Hyphomicrobium has been linked to suppression of  black shank (38). Together, these results suggest that pathogen  suppression was potentially driven by different taxa in the beginning  and at the end of the field experiment, indicative of functional re- dundancy present in rhizosphere microbiomes. While initial bacterial community composition could well predict  future disease outcomes, we also found that community diversity  became significantly different between healthy and diseased plant  microbiomes at weeks 5 and 6. Specifically, the microbiomes as- sociated with healthy plants became less diverse, while no clear change  was observed in the diseased plant microbiomes. While it is difficult  to disentangle the potential drivers behind this, the fact that the dis- criminating taxa initially associated with healthy plants disappeared  during the experiment suggests that it was driven by differences in  bacterial community assembly during the experiment. The species  co-occurrence networks also differed substantially between the initial  and final microbiomes associated with healthy and diseased plants.  In general, the networks associated with diseased plants had fewer  associated species, fewer connections, shorter average path lengths,  and fewer modular structures. Similar to changes in community  composition, diversity, and functioning, network differences were  initially much clearer and converged between healthy and diseased  plants toward the end of the experiment. Together, these results  suggest that bacteria were potentially interacting more often and  more predictably in healthy versus diseased plant microbiomes,  which could have increased the community stability against pathogen  invasions (39). In addition, the higher modularity observed in healthy  plant microbiomes suggests that certain bacteria were stably associated  with each other, indicative of potentially stabilizing mutualistic or  commensal interactions (40,  41). While these hypotheses need to be  confirmed experimentally in the future, they suggest that in addition  to specific taxa, the interactions between certain groups of bacteria  are also likely to be important for constraining R. solanacearum in- fections in the rhizosphere (39, 42, 43). Despite a slight convergence in microbiome composition during  plant development, the beneficial effects of healthy plant microbiota  could be transferred to future plant generations in a separate soil  transplantation experiment highlighting the importance of functional  microbiomes for disease resistance. This raises an important question:  Do healthy plant-associated microbiomes have something extra or  do diseased plant-associated microbiomes lack something? To fully answer this question would require first defining the core root micro- biome of tomato as a baseline control. While being out of scope of  this study, such investigations should be an integral part of future  plant microbiome research (44,  45) to elucidate how taxonomic and  functional differences in microbiomes causally determine plant  disease outcomes. However, diseased plant microbiomes were also  associated with certain rare taxa that were absent in healthy plant  microbiomes and could thus have promoted pathogen infection (24).  Moreover, differences in the pathogen densities between healthy  and diseased microbiomes became evident only toward the end of  the experiment, suggesting that the effects of initial microbiomes  were potentially magnified during the community assembly. Develop- ment of dysbiosis, a microbial imbalance associated with the in- creased dominance of bacterial pathogen (46,  47), could thus also be  important in explaining the bacterial wilt disease dynamics (9 ). While  further experiments are needed to unequivocally separate these po- tential explanations, our results suggest that both initial and devel- opmental differences in microbiome composition might play an  important role for bacterial wilt outbreaks. On the basis of our results, we propose a rethinking of current  approaches used to manage plant diseases in agricultural systems.  First, instead of a pathogen-focused view, better solutions for con- trolling plant disease outbreaks may be achieved by managing the  composition of soil microbiome as a whole. For example, instead of  attempting to directly reduce pathogen densities, increasing the relative  abundance of naturally protective bacteria using organic fertilization  might offer a better strategy. Second, the discriminating power of  certain bacterial taxa suggests that the rare microbiome may represent  an untapped pool of beneficial microorganisms (48) that could be  selected and enriched by plant breeding, direct microbial inoculation  along with the seedlings (49), or soil management. For example,  certain agricultural management practices, such as organic fertilization,  might promote physicochemical and biological properties linked  to soil suppressiveness. In a wider perspective, our results suggest  that initial microbiome composition plays a crucial role in predeter- mining the disease dynamics and future health of associated host  organisms. These results might be important for understanding po- tential beneficial effects of crop rotation for pathogen suppression.  It is known that different crop species harbor specific core microbiomes  that can suppress pathogens (50). Rotating or intercropping certain  plant species in combination could thus potentially be used to shift  and modify the composition and suppressiveness of natural soil micro- biomes without the need for pesticides. Moreover, our results have  potentially important implications for managing diseases also in  medical contexts. For example, if minor changes in the composition  of an individual’s early life microbiome cascade into differential  health outcomes later in life, then many diseases could be potentially  prevented by ensuring the development of an initial “healthy” micro- biome. We conclude that despite the often-stochastic nature of disease  variability in natural environments, plant disease dynamics can also  be driven by deterministic processes linked to within-field spatial  differences in taxonomic and functional properties of soil microbiomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS Rhizobox system and repeated sampling design We designed a semi-open mesocosm system (“rhizobox”) to repeatedly  collect rhizosphere soil from each individual plant without damaging  the root system. This method allowed a reconstruction of time series  Downloaded from https://www.science.org on February 08, 2024 Wei et al., Sci. Adv. 2019; 5 : eaaw0759     25 September 2019 SCIENCE ADVANCES | RESEARCH ARTICLE7 of 11ranging from initial soil samples throughout plant development  and disease onset and quantifying changes in pathogen density dy- namics, physicochemical soil properties, and microbiome assembly.  The rhizobox consisted of a three-layer cylinder (Fig. 1A and fig. S1A)  with a height of 136 mm and a diameter of 110 mm. The outer layer  was made of a 4-mm metal mesh to support the rhizobox. The inner  layer (root compartment) was made of a 50- m nylon mesh net,  which prevents roots from entering into the middle layer. It consisted  of 18 separate nylon mesh bags that could be removed individually  during sampling (height, 136 mm; width, 18 to 21 mm; thickness,  1 to 2 mm; mesh size, 150  m). Each bag was filled with 4 g of  homogenized and sterilized field soil dug out from the same location  where the rhizoboxes were placed during the field experiment. To  this end, we used soil from a tomato field in Qilin, Nanjing, China,  that has been naturally infected by R. solanacearum for decades (50).  After removing plant debris, the soil was sieved (<2 mm), homogenized,  divided into nylon bags, and sterilized by gamma irradiation (50 kilo- grays). Each bag was sprayed with sterile distilled water, gently  squeezed to 1- to 2-mm thickness, and arranged between the outer  and the inner layers of the rhizobox to create the middle sampling  layer. The inner layer was filled with natural soil dug out from the  location where the rhizoboxes were buried during the field experi- ment. The soil in the nylon mesh bags of the middle layer could thus  be colonized by bacteria from the surrounding natural soil and  affected by the development of plant roots and secretion of plant  root exudates (Fig. 1B). As a result, the soil in the nylon mesh bags  of the middle layer initially represented microbial communities present  in the bulk soil (fig. S12) before the inner compartment of rhizobox  became densely filled with roots after 3 weeks of planting in the field  (Fig. 1C). The design and sampling of the field experiment Tomato seeds (Solanum lycopersicum cv. “Jipin”) were surface-sterilized  with NaClO (3%; v:v) and germinated on moist filter paper for 2 days  before sowing in sterilized nursery substrate (commercially available  from Huaian Agricultural Technology Development Ltd., Huaian,  Jiangsu, China). Tomato seedlings were incubated in the greenhouse  at 30° ± 3°C for 3 weeks before planting in the field in rhizoboxes. The field experiment was conducted in the same field described  above (Qilin, Nanjing, China). The study site had been under a tomato  monoculture system with two crop seasons per year for 19 years.  The spring crop season typically lasts from February to June and the  autumn crop season lasts from July to November. The nitrogen fertilizer  was provided at 103.1 kg ha−1, phosphate was provided at 31.3 kg ha−1,  and potassium was provided at 70.3 kg ha−1 per crop season; irriga - tion was applied three times per crop season; and pesticides were  applied when necessary. The study field was tilled conventionally after  every crop season. We conducted the field experiment in 2015  during the late-spring crop season between May and June. A soil  corer was used to create 136-mm-deep holes suitable for the rhizobox.  After removing the plant debris and rocks, the soil was placed right  back into the root compartment of the rhizobox, which was imme- diately buried back into the hole. Triplicate soil samples were collected  from the inner and outer sides of the middle sampling layer using a  soil corer (diameter, 1 cm), and homogenized and pooled soil samples  were regarded as the initial bulk soil samples (week 0). A subset of  initial soil samples was mixed with 30% (v:v) glycerol and stored at  −80°C for further processing. One tomato seedling was planted to  the root compartment of each rhizobox, and rhizoboxes were placed 30 cm apart from each other. Three experimental plots (1 m apart from  each other) were set up with a total of 16 rhizoboxes per plot (fig. S1B). Five days later, three nylon mesh bags were randomly removed  from rhizoboxes to explore the primary effects of microbial coloniza- tion from surrounding bulk soil to the middle sampling layer as, at  this stage, plant roots were too small to exert any influence on the  microbiome. Sampling of rhizoboxes was started 3 weeks after  planting of tomatoes (Fig. 1, C and D), and from week 3 onward, three  nylon bags were randomly collected from each rhizobox on a weekly  basis up until week 6. These samples were considered as rhizosphere  samples (Fig. 1, B and C) and stored at −80°C for further analyses  after homogenization of replicate samples per sampling time point  of each plant. More than half of the tomato plants showed disease  symptoms after 6 weeks of planting. The field experiment was  maintained for another week (total of 7 weeks) to ensure that disease  incidence had reached its maximum peak and that none of the  healthy plants developed any disease symptoms (fig. S1C). Seven  weeks after planting of tomatoes, R. solanacearum densities present  in the plant stem crowns were measured for all the 48 plants by  macerating 5 g of stem crown tissue in 45 ml of sterile distilled water  followed by serial dilution plating on R. solanacearum semiselective  media (SMSA) (51). Individual plants that showed no wilt symptoms  and were negative for pathogen isolation were classified as healthy  plants (fig. S1D). Plants that showed wilt symptoms and were positive  for pathogen isolation were classified as diseased plants. Plants that  did not show wilt symptoms but were positive for pathogen isolation  were considered as latently infected plants (52) and were not in- cluded in the further analyses in this study. The repeated sampling  strategy allowed us to go back in time after observing the final health  condition (diseased versus healthy) of individual plants. To this end,  we randomly chose 12 healthy and 12 diseased plants and traced  back the changes in microbiome composition, physicochemical soil  properties, and pathogen densities for healthy and diseased plants  individually. We also collected soil samples from healthy and dis- eased plants at the end of the experiment (week 7) to test soil sup- pressiveness in a separate greenhouse with a second generation of  tomato plants (described in detail later). DNA extraction, quantitative PCR, and 16S  rRNA   amplicon sequencing Soil DNA was isolated from 500 mg of soil using the PowerSoil  DNA Isolation Kit (MoBio, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the  manufacturer’s instructions. DNA extracts were quantified using a  NanoDrop spectrophotometer (ND2000, Thermo Scientific, DE, USA).  Aliquots of DNA extract were used for quantitative polymerase chain  reaction (qPCR) analyses, and the other was used for PCR amplifi- cation before 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) amplicon sequencing. The total bacterial and R. solanacearum pathogen abundances  were determined using qPCR with primer sets Eub338/Eub518 (53)  and Rsol_fliC (54), respectively, using SYBR Premix Ex Taq Kit  (Takara, Dalian, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.  Each individual sample was measured in triplicate using a 7500 Fast  Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA). A plasmid  standard (pMD 19-T vector; Takara, Dalian, China) was generated  from cloned target genes (fliC and 16S  rRNA) from R. solanacearum   strain QL-Rs1115 (50), which is the dominant pathogen genotype  in the field described above (Qilin, Nanjing, China). The V4 regions of the bacterial 16S  rRNA gene were PCR-amplified  using the primer pairs 563F and 802R (55) with an Illumina adaptor  Downloaded from https://www.science.org on February 08, 2024 Wei et al., Sci.

The PCR products were purified  (AxyPrep PCR Clean-up Kit, Axygen Biosciences, CA, USA) before  performing agarose gel electrophoresis. The concentrations of the  purified amplicon products were determined using QuantiFluor-ST  (Promega, WI, USA) and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq platform  at Shanghai Biozeron Biological Technology Co. Ltd. The sequence data were processed with the UPARSE pipeline (57).  Briefly, read pairs from each sample were assembled, and sequences  were screened with a maximal expected error of 0.25 and a minimum  length of 200 base pairs (bp). Singletons were discarded, and se- quence reads were then clustered into OTUs at 3% dissimilarity.  Chimeras were removed using UCHIME (58). The representative  sequences and OTU table obtained were then analyzed using  mothur (59). All the samples were rarefied to the depth of the smallest  sample (25,316 reads). The taxonomies of each OTU were anno- tated using the RDP 16S  rRNA classifier (60) with a confidence  threshold of 80%. Metagenomic analysis In addition to taxonomic composition, we performed a metagenomic  analysis to gain insights into the functional differences between  healthy and diseased microbiomes. A total of four healthy and four  diseased samples were randomly selected at both the initial (week 0)  and the final (week 6) week of the field experiment for meta- genomic analysis. Metagenomic shotgun sequencing libraries were  prepared and sequenced at Shanghai Biozeron Biological Technol- ogy Co. Ltd. For each sample, 1 mg of genomic DNA was used with  Illumina’s TruSeq for library preparation. Libraries were sequenced  using the Illumina HiSeq 4000, 50-bp paired-end technology. Raw  FASTQ sequence files were filter-trimmed using Trimmomatic  to remove adapter sequences (61). Reads were quality-filtered using  fastq_quality_filter from the FASTX toolkit at default settings. Func - tional annotation was performed by comparison of quality-filtered  reads to annotated ones using COG and eggNOG databases. Culture-dependent assessment of antimicrobial activity  of Bacillus and Pseudomonas bacteria against R. solanacearum As a validation of the metagenomics data, we performed an additional  screening of antimicrobial activity of initial soil bacteria associated  with healthy and diseased plants. Four initial soil replicates were  randomly pooled into one, resulting in three replicates for healthy  and diseased plants. We focused on two common soil bacterial genera,  Bacillus and Pseudomonas, that are well-characterized bacterial  groups known to produce a broad range of antibiotics and linked to  pathogen suppression in several previous studies (7 , 62). For isolation  of Bacillus and Pseudomonas, bacteria from the initial soil, two  semiselective media were used: V8 juice agar for generic members  of Bacillus (326 ml of V8 juice, 33 g of NaCl, and 0.8 g of glucose in  490 ml of distilled water at pH 5.2 containing filter-sterilized solutions  of 45 mg of actidione and 22.5 mg of polymyxin B) and CFC for  pseudomonads (63). Soil suspensions were serially diluted and plated  on the semiselective media (soil suspensions used for isolation of  Bacillus strains were pretreated at 80°C for 10 min to enrich heat-  resistant Bacillus spores). After 2 days of incubation at 30°C, 40 purified  Bacillus and Pseudomonas isolates per replicate (n  = 3) were ran- domly isolated from the selective plates based on colony morphology,  resulting in a total of 120 Bacillus and Pseudomonas isolates for both  future healthy and diseased plants. The inhibition effect on R. solanacearum  QL-Rs1115 pathogen was carried out by using a spot-spraying method  described previously (50). Soil transplantation experiment linking the suppressiveness  of healthy and diseased plant microbiomes between   plant generations To test whether the initial differences in healthy and diseased plant  microbiomes translated into long-term suppression of the pathogen  during successive plant generation, we directly tested how soils de- rived from first-generation plants constrained pathogen growth  in the second plant generation using a separate greenhouse experi- ment. To this end, we collected soil from the root compartment  of rhizoboxes at the end of the experiment (week 7, one week after  the last rhizosphere soil sampling). Three root compartment soil  replicates were randomly pooled into one, resulting in four soil  replicates for both healthy and diseased plants. Pathogen abundance  in the root compartment soil was determined using serial dilution  plating on SMSA media after total pathogen abundances were  adjusted to 3 × 107 colony-forming units per gram of soil for all  samples using a pure culture of R. solanacearum QL-Rs1115 strain  isolated from the same field (50). Three treatments were set up: (i)  healthy soil originating from healthy plants, (ii) diseased soil originat - ing from diseased plants, and (iii) sterilized soil from the healthy  plants (incubated at 80°C for 3 hours). With all treatments, tomato  seeds (cv. Jipin) were surface-sterilized (3% NaClO), germinated (30°C  for 2 days), and sown in pots (height, 135 mm; diameter, 120 mm) con - taining the different soils (dry weight, 400 g). Each pot with 12 tomato  plants was regarded as one replicate, and each treatment had four  replicate pots. The pots were incubated in growth chambers with a  16-hour light/8-hour dark photoperiod at 26°C and replenished  with sterile distilled water to equal weight to maintain identical soil  moisture between treatments. Disease incidence was recorded as  the percentage of wilted tomato plants per replicate after 3 weeks  of sowing. Statistical analyses The soil microbiome composition was ordinated by principal coor- dinates analysis (PCoA) using unweighted UniFrac distance. Differ- ences between microbiome composition of healthy and diseased plants  were calculated by using AMOVA and mothur. Unweighted UniFrac  distances are sensitive to rare OTUs and thus emphasize differences  in the presence or absence of taxa (64). Initial soil physicochemical  properties were ordinated by principal components analysis [R package  FactoMineR (65)]. Linear discriminant analysis and a significance  test were used to explore the most discriminating OTUs between  health conditions using LEfSe (66) and DESeq2 (67), respectively.  Three screening criteria were used: (i) linear discriminant analysis  with a score of ≥2 (health condition relative to diseased condition),  (ii) fold change ≥2 (health condition relative to diseased condition),  and (iii) significance test with P  < 0.05. We further validated this  approach using the random forest approach (68) and found that  random forest analysis yielded very similar results, identifying 10  discriminating OTUs that were all also identified by our discrimina- tion criteria at week 0, and 10 discriminating OTUs, of which 6 were  also identified by our discrimination criteria at week 6 (fig. S6).  Ralstonia OTUs were not included in the analyses exploring the role  of discriminating OTUs during plant and microbiome development.  Co-occurrence network analysis was performed following Molecular  Ecological Network Analyses Pipeline (69).

The edges (i.e., connections between  taxa as OTUs) correspond to a strong and significant (positive or  negative) correlation between nodes (i.e., taxa as OTUs) (71). The  network was graphed using Gephi (72). We also used the NetShift  method to identify potential keystone driver taxa based on differ- ences in network interactions between healthy and diseased plant  microbiomes (https://web.rniapps.net/netshift). This method allows  one to quantify the directional changes in the individual node inter- actions (73) by exploring whether there is a significant overall  change in community patterns between healthy and diseased samples,  whether there are major changes in associations of each constituent  node (taxon) in healthy and diseased samples, whether specific  nodes (taxa) have been important members of the community, and  whether there is an increase in their importance in the diseased  samples. Temporal dynamics of phylogenetic similarity between  soil microbiomes associated with healthy and diseased plants were  analyzed with linear regression as a function of time (quadratic term).  The correlation between the relative abundance of screened rare  OTUs enriched in healthy and diseased plants and sampling time  was assessed with an exponential decay model. Student’s t  test and  one-way analysis of variance (Duncan’s multiple range test) were  used to compare mean differences between the treatments using  SPSS (v. 19) and STAMP (74). All amplicon sequencing data have  been deposited in the DDBJ SRA under the accession number  SRP090147. The metagenomics-derived gene catalogs used for the  current analysis are publicly available (SRA database accession  number PRJNA492172).

Nimchuk,1Paul T. Tarr,1Carolyn Ohno,1 Xiang Qu,1and Elliot M. Meyerowitz1,* 1Division of Biology 156-29, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 91125, USA Summary Background: Cell numbers in above-ground meristems of plants are thought to be maintained by a feedback loop driven by perception of the glycopeptide ligand CLAVATA3 (CLV3) by the CLAVATA1 (CLV1) receptor kinase and the CLV2/CORYNE (CRN) receptor-like complex [ 1]. CLV3 produced in the stem cells at the meristem apex limits the expression level of thestem cell-promoting homeodomain protein WUSCHEL (WUS) in the cells beneath, where CLV1 andWUS RNA are localized. WUS downregulation nonautonomously reduces stem cellproliferation. Overexpression of CLV3 eliminates the stem cells, causing meristem termination [ 2], and loss of CLV3 func- tion allows meristem overproliferation [ 3]. There are many questions regarding the CLV3/CLV1 interaction, including where in the meristem it occurs, how it is regulated, and how it is that a large range of CLV3 concentrations gives no meri- stem size phenotype [ 4]. Results: Here we use genetics and live imaging to examine the cell biology of CLV1 in Arabidopsis meristematic tissue. We demonstrate that plasma membrane-localized CLV1 isreduced in concentration by CLV3, which causes trafﬁckingof CLV1 to lytic vacuoles. We ﬁnd that changes in CLV2 activity have no detectable effects on CLV1 levels. We also ﬁnd that CLV3 appears to diffuse broadly in meristems, contrary to a recent sequestration model [ 5]. Conclusions: This study provides a new model for CLV1 function in plant stem cell maintenance and suggests that downregulation of plasma membrane-localized CLV1 by its CLV3 ligand can account for the buffering of CLV3 signaling in the maintenance of stem cell pools in plants. Introduction Postembryonic growth in higher plants is driven by popula- tions of meristematic cells that are continuously maintained over the life of the plant. In plants like Arabidopsis , above- ground tissues are derived from the shoot apical meristem(SAM), which begins as a vegetative meristem making leaves and then becomes an inﬂorescence meristem (IM) that bears determinate ﬂoral meristems (FMs), from which the reproduc- tive organs are derived. These diverse meristematic forms share a common tissue organization composed of a stem cell population called a central zone at the apical meristem tip, above a set of cells sometimes called the organizing center or rib meristem, and ﬂanked by a peripheral zone in which organs form. This identity organization is overlaid upon a tissue pattern consisting of clonal monolayers of L1 and L2 cells overlying the corpus cell population. Mutations in any of theCLAVATA (CLV )o rCORYNE (CRN ) loci result in an overprolif- eration of stem cells in shoot meristems. Mutations in the homeodomain protein WUSCHEL (WUS) result in a premature termination of the stem cell population [ 6].CLV3 encodes a small extracellular protein that is processed into a 13 aminoacid peptide and modiﬁed with b-1,2-linked triarabinoside chains into its active in vivo form (CLV3p; [ 7–9]). It is thought that the mature CLV3p diffuses from its expression domain in the upper meristem layers into deeper tissue layers where CLV1 is expressed [ 10]. CLV1 is a transmembrane receptor kinase with extracellular leucine-rich repeats that can bindCLV3p in vitro [ 10, 11 ]. Binding is thought to activate CLV1 kinase activity, which in turn leads to a downregulation ofWUS expression in the rib meristem. WUS can activate CLV3 expression in a cell-nonautonomous manner, thereby providing a mechanistic feedback loop that maintains stem cell balance [ 2, 12 ]. In addition, a parallel CLV3p sensing pathway involving the receptor-like protein CLV2 and thereceptor-like kinase homolog CRN also regulates stem cell proliferation via WUS [13, 14 ].CLV2 /CRN is expressed broadly, and this complex is proposed to act as a receptorfor a diverse set of CLV3-related ligands, termed CLE proteins, throughout the plant [ 1]. In addition, the receptor kinase RPK2/ TOAD2 also acts to limit WUS expression in the meristem [ 15]. Because it is thought that CLV1 andWUS could be expressed in overlapping cell populations in the meristem, it has beenproposed that CLV1 may act to prevent the diffusion of CLV3 into the entire WUS domain by sequestering CLV3p [ 5]. Although high levels of ectopic CLV3 can downregulate WUS , alteration of CLV3 levels over a wide range are buffered by unknown mechanisms in the meristem [ 4]. In addition, long- term expression of high levels of CLV3 can lead to reactivationofWUS [4], suggesting that strict controls upon the perception of CLV3 exist in plants. What these control mechanisms areand how they relate to the function of the various receptors are unknown. Our knowledge of how these loci interact to control stem cell function is derived from genetic, biochemical, and transient expression imaging studies. However, the literature contains several contradictions. For example, past biochemical studies suggested that CLV2 is required for stabilization of CLV1, with a 90% reduction in CLV1 levels seen in clv2-1 null plants [ 16]. This result does not appear to be compatible with the geneticobservation that clv2 clv1 andcrn clv1 double mutants are additive [ 14, 15, 17 ]. Attempts to image CLV1 and associated proteins in living meristems have until now been unsuccessful. Here we use a combination of genetic analysis and live confocal imaging of CLV1 reporters to explore the cell biology of CLV1 in living meristematic tissue. We observe that CLV1 accumulates at the plasma membrane (PM) in clv3 plants and is preferentially targeted to the lytic vacuole by CLV3.These results indicate that CLV3 promotes ligand-dependent trafﬁcking of the CLV1 receptor kinase, analogous to the ligand-dependent downregulation of receptors in animal systems and at least one plant receptor-like kinase (RLK) [18]. Endosomal trafﬁcking and lysosomal degradation of receptors in animal and yeast cells provide a mechanism fordownregulation of activated receptors [ 19]. In some cases, *Correspondence: meyerow@caltech.edureceptors signal from endosomal compartments providing strict temporal and spatial regulation of pathway activation [20]. Trafﬁcking of CLV1 likely requires meristem-speciﬁc cofactors. We demonstrate that CLV2 is neither required for CLV3-dependent trafﬁcking of CLV1 nor required for stabiliza- tion of CLV1 in clv3 plants. These results call into question the validity of some biochemical studies but are consistent with genetic analyses of the loci. Using trafﬁcking of CLV1 as a marker for CLV3 perception, we are able to ascertain that CLV3 appears to diffuse broadly in the meristem and that sequestration of CLV3 by CLV1 is therefore unlikely to play a major role in meristem maintenance. These data provide a new model for CLV1/CLV3 interactions and suggest that downregulation of CLV1 by CLV3 could provide the CLV3 buff- ering function observed in previous work. Results CLV1 Accumulates at the Plasma Membrane inclv3 Mutants In order to study the cell biology of CLV1-CLV3 interactions,we ﬁrst created a CLV1 promoter construct to express CLV1- 23GFP for live imaging (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures andFigure S1 available online). This construct fully complemented the clv1-11 andclv1-101 mutants in all linesexamined (n > 30) (Figures S1 A and S1B). This fusion protein localized to the PM in tobacco transient expression experi- ments (data not shown). In contrast to the results in tobacco, we rarely observed PM localization of CLV1-2 3GFP in the IMs of T1 transgenic plants. Instead, we observed in mostcases a faint GFP signal in the vacuole of L3 cells. In othercases, we observed faint apparently cytosolic background signal (compare Figure 1 C with Figures 2 A and 2C and Fig- ure S2 for imaging controls). In animal systems, receptors are internalized and degraded in response to ligand binding, and we postulated that we might be observing a similar process in the case of CLV1. We introgressed a single-insert line of pCLV1::CLV1-2 3GFP into the clv1-11 clv3-2 back- ground, which is RNA null for both CLV1 andCLV3 [21, 22 ]. We compared young lateral IMs because these were the closest in size and shape between the two genotypes. We observed the same weak apparent vacuolar accumulation and lack of PM GFP signal in CLV3 progeny in rib meristem cells as in a wild-type genetic background ( Figures 1 A and 1C). In clv3-2 progeny, however, we observed GFP signal at the presumed PM in rib meristem cells and a correspondinglack of vacuolar accumulation ( Figures 1 B and 1D). In both genotypes (clv1-11 clv3-2 and clv1-11 CLV3 ), we observed punctate structures in the cytosol that are likely Golgi appa- ratus (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures ). We conﬁrmed these results by introgressing a separate clv1-11 Figure 1.

This line complements but expresses CLV1-2 3GFP at a much lower level. In this line, we did not observe PM accumulation in the IMs in CLV3 plants. These data indicate that in the absence of CLV3, CLV1 accumulates at the PM, whereas it is found inthe vacuole in the presence of CLV3 protein (see below). This suggests that CLV3 drives CLV1 endocytosis from the PM fol- lowed by subsequent targeting to the vacuole. Both CLV1 and CLV3 are also expressed in young FMs arising from the ﬂanks of the main IM. In stage 3 FMs, CLV1-2 3GFP localization was largely similar to that of the main IM ( Figures S4 and S6 ). In general, levels of CLV1-2 3GFP appeared higher in FMs compared to IMs when expressed from pCLV1 , although this may be due to partial shadowing of the IM by peripheralFMs. On rare occasions (3 of 20 experiments), we observed weak CLV1-2 3GFP signal at the PM in FMs of CLV3 plants; however, CLV1-GFP PM signal was always higher in clv3 mutants in those same experiments. In a separate survey of 21 individual CLV1::CLV1-2 3Ypet CLV3 transgenic lines, we did not detect any PM localization in FMs, further conﬁrmingthat PM accumulation of CLV1 is strongly reduced in the CLV3 background. We then expressed the CLV1-2 3GFP fusion at high level in all cells of the IM. We generated a pUBQ::CLV1-2 3GFP construct and transformed clv1-11 ,clv3-2 clv1-11 , and clv1- 101 plants. Constitutive expression of CLV1 complemented theclv1 null phenotype without any other observed effects (Figure S1 F). We introgressed three individual pUBQ::CLV1- 23GFP lines, two clv1-11 lines and one clv1-101 line, into clv3-2 clv1-11 plants and analyzed progeny in a manner similar to the above pCLV1 experiments. Consistent with the imaging of the pCLV1::CLV1-2 3GFP lines, we observed a strong vacu- olar accumulation in CLV3 plants and a contrasting strong PM accumulation in clv3-2 plants (Figure 2 ). The vacuolar signal derived from the pUBQ10 lines  was considerably stronger than that seen in most, but not all, pCLV1 imaging attempts. Similar results were obtained from crosses of pUBQ::CLV1- GFP lines from the clv1-101 background (Figures 2 A and 2B) and the clv1-11 background (Figures 2 C and 2D, detail shown). In very high-level expressing IMs, we occasionally noticed weak PM accumulation of CLV1 in the CLV3 background from pUBQ andpCLV1 lines (Figure 2 C; data not shown), sug- gesting that CLV1 may saturate downstream trafﬁcking components at very high levels. Variation at ERECTA (ER) did not affect CLV1-2 3GFP localization in either clv3 orCLV3 backgrounds (Figure 2 ; data not shown). These results conﬁrm that CLV3 promotes vacuolar localization of CLV1 at the expense of PM accumulation. CLV1 Trafﬁcs to the Lytic Vacuole in VTI11-Dependent Manner To further test the hypothesis that CLV3 alters CLV1 traf- ﬁcking, we took a genetic approach and crossed the pCLV1::CLV1-2 3GFP transgene into a zig-1 mutant back- ground. ZIG/VTI11 encodes a Q-SNARE protein that localizes to the trans-Golgi network/prevacuolar compartment and is required for transport of cargo to the lytic vacuole [ 23–26 ]. In zig-1 CLV3 plants, the CLV1-2 3GFP vacuolar signal was greatly reduced compared to ZIG CLV3 plants in most exper- iments, indicating that CLV1 is trafﬁcked to the lytic vacuolein a ZIG/VTI11-dependent manner in CLV3 plants (Figures 3 A and 3B). We consistently observed a stronger PM accumula-tion of CLV1-2 3GFP signal in zig-1 CLV3 plants that was rarelyseen in ZIG CLV3 plants. We noted that upon prolonged FM4- 64 staining in CLV3 plants, internal CLV1-2 3GFP was bounded by FM4-64-stained tonoplast ( Figure 3 C). We also observed colocalization of CLV1-2 3GFP signal with two known lytic vacuole markers, LysoTracker red and the vacuolar RFPmarker (VAC-RFP; Figures 3 D and 3E; see Supplemental Experimental Procedures ), conﬁrming the vacuolar targeting of CLV1-2 3GFP in CLV3 plants. We conﬁrmed the localization Figure 3.

Ectopic CLV1 Does Not Sequester CLV3 CLV3 is expressed in the L1, L2, and L3 layers in wild-type plants. From there, it is believed that the CLV3 propeptide issecreted to the extracellular space, where it is processed and modiﬁed with L-arabinose into its active 13 amino acid glycopeptide form, CLV3p [ 8]. It is not known where CLV3p diffuses and is active in the shoot apical meristem. Previousattempts to deﬁne the sites to which CLV3 diffuses in the IM used a CLV3-GFP fusion [ 5, 7]. Later studies demonstrated that CLV3p is proteolytically cleaved from its precursor atboth its amino-terminal and carboxy-terminal ends, indicating that the CLV3-GFP in these earlier experiments likely reported only the extracellular movement of the processed GFP and not the active CLV3p. Using pUBQ::CLV1-2 3GFP lines andvacuolar trafﬁcking of CLV1-2 3GFP as a proxy for the CLV3p response of CLV1, we determined that CLV3p diffusesbroadly throughout the IM from its site of synthesis ( Figures 3 A and 3B; Figure 5 ). We observed CLV3 -dependent vacuolar accumulation of CLV1-2 3GFP throughout the L1 layer, in the peripheral zone and central zone, and also in deeper regionsencompassing the rib meristem. We also consistently observed CLV3 -dependent vacuole targeting in young ﬂower primordia, suggesting that CLV3 may either diffuse acrossthe boundary regions or be synthesized in low levels inemerging primordia. It has been proposed that CLV1 protects lower regions of the IM from CLV3 by sequestering CLV3 and preventing its diffusion [ 5].CLV1 is normally expressed at higher levels in the rib zone of IMs, and its RNA is largelyabsent from the L1 and L2 layers. We tested this sequestration hypothesis using high-level ectopic expression of CLV1 , including in the L1, L2, and L3 layers in the pUBQ lines. We found that CLV1 overexpression in L1 and L2 cells did not prevent perception of CLV3p by CLV1 in the lower central zone and in the rib meristem as judged by the vacuolar target- ing of CLV1-2 3GFP in L3 and L4 cells ( Figure 5 ). In addition, lateral epidermal L1 cells on the ﬂanks of the IM still showedresponse to CLV3. These cells would be expected to be even further from the site of CLV3 than L3 cells. This observation suggests that functional sequestration of CLV3p by CLV1 does not occur to a detectable degree in the L3 layer of wild- type meristems. These results are also consistent with the observation that meristem function is unperturbed over a wide range of CLV3 levels [ 4] and the lack of wus-like pheno- types seen in any combination of clv1 heterozygotes [ 21, 27 ].

We gener- ated DEX::CLV3 clv3-2 plants in which constitutive CLV3 expression is inducibly controlled by the application of dexa-methasone (DEX) in the clv3-2 background (Supplemental Experimental Procedures ). In control clv3-2 pUBQ::CLV1- 23GFP plants and untreated clv3-2 pUBQ::CLV1-2 3GFP DEX::CLV3 plants, we observed the expected PM accumula- tion of CLV1-2 3GFP in L1 cells in young IMs (Figures 6 A and 6D). In contrast, clv3-2 pUBQ::CLV1-2 3GFP DEX::CLV3 plants treated with DEX for several days displayed a range of CLV1-2 3GFP localizations. Whereas some IMs displayed near normal levels of CLV1-2 3GFP at the PM in L1 cells (data not shown), others displayed a strong vacuolar accumu- lation similar to that seen in the CLV3 pUBQ::CLV1-2 3GFP plant lines (Figure 6 B). Others displayed greatly reducedCLV1-2 3GFP signal at the PM (Figure 6 C) yet still expressed CLV1-2 3GFP strongly in the epidermis of mature sepals (data not shown). Neither of the latter observations were seen in control-treated clv3-2 pUBQ::CLV1-2 3GFP DEX::CLV3 plants. These results indicate that CLV3 is sufﬁcient to bothinduce PM depletion and drive trafﬁcking of CLV1 to the lytic vacuole. Vacuolar accumulation of the CLV1-GFP signal was ﬁrst weakly detected at 4 hr post DEX application in two independent experiments, suggesting that this response was relatively rapid. These data demonstrate that CLV3 is both necessary and sufﬁcient to drive depletion of CLV1 from the PM in apical meristems, followed by trafﬁcking to the lytic vacuole in a posttranscriptional manner. We did not observe strong vacuolar targeting of CLV1- 23GFP in DEX-treated tissues outside of meristems in pUBQ::CLV1-2 3GFP DEX::CLV3 plants, consistent with the robust PM accumulation of CLV1-2 3GFP in the mature sepal epidermis of CLV3 pUBQ::CLV1-2 3GFP plants (data not shown; Supplemental Experimental Procedures ). This obser- vation suggests that CLV1 requires meristem-speciﬁc cofac- tors in order to trafﬁc to the vacuole in response to CLV3. Also consistent with this, we observed no changes in CLV1- 23GFP vacuolar targeting in response to either CLV3p or DEX::CLV3 in transient tobacco leaf transformation assays (data not shown). CLV2 Is Not Required for CLV1 Stability or Trafﬁcking A previously published study concluded that CLV2 is required for CLV1 stability, with a reduction in CLV1 levels by 90% in CLV3 clv2 plants relative to wild-type [ 16]. As described in theIntroduction , several lines of evidence challenge these data and conclusions. We therefore sought to address what role, if any, CLV2 might play in CLV1 levels or cellular location. We crossed both pCLV1::CLV1-2 3GFP and pUBQ::CLV1- 23GFP plant lines into a clv1-11 clv2-1 clv3-2 triple mutant, which is protein null for CLV2 as a result of a stop codon at amino acid position 33 in the CLV2 signal sequence [ 16], and selected the appropriate F2 genotypes. We observeda similar pattern of CLV1-2 3GFP signal in pUBQ lines, with reduced PM accumulation in the pUBQ lines and signiﬁcant vacuolar targeting in CLV3 CLV2 and CLV3 clv2-1 plants (Figure 7 A). These data demonstrate that loss of CLV2 does not impair CLV3-dependent lytic vacuole targeting. Similarly, CLV1 levels and PM targeting appeared unchanged in the clv3-2 CLV2 andclv3-2 clv2-1 backgrounds (Figure 7 B). Similar results were also seen in both IMs and stage 3 FMs from pCLV1 lines (Figures S5 and S6 ). We also did not detect a reduction in CLV1-2 3GFP levels in the clv2-1 mutant by western blot analysis (Figure S7 B). These data indicate that CLV2 is not required for the stability or accumulation ofGFP-labeled CLV1. DiscussionThe experiments reported here suggest a new model for CLV1 function. In the absence of CLV3, CLV1 accumulates at the PM. In this model, CLV3p is secreted from L1, L2, and some L3 cells and diffuses into to the CLV1 expression domain. Ligand binding triggers activation of the CLV1 kinase, which in turncauses recruitment of accessory proteins, resulting in CLV1 internalization from the PM followed by VTI11/ZIG-dependent trafﬁcking to the lytic vacuole, where CLV1 is degraded. It seems unlikely that quantitative sequestration of CLV3 by CLV1 occurs, as is currently believed, because CLV3 has an Figure 6. CLV3 Is Sufﬁcient to Drive CLV1 Downregulation at the Plasma Membrane and Trafﬁcking to the Lytic Vacuole Inducible expression of CLV3 restores vacuolar trafﬁcking of CLV1-23 GFP.

Although WUS , CLV3 , and CLV1 have not been observed to colocalize simulta- neously in the same plant, recent in situ hybridizations suggest that CLV3 expression partially overlaps with that of WUS in meristems [ 28]. We did not observe robust changes in CLV1 protein levels between CLV3 andclv3-2 plants. Similar results have been seen for FLS2 and S receptor kinase (S. Robatzek, personal communication; [ 29]). It could be that any changes in CLV1 levels are masked by CLV1 levels outside of these cells, forexample in vascular tissues, where CLV1 is present. Alterna- tively, the amount of PM CLV1 in clv3 plants might be roughly equivalent to the sum of CLV1 in vesicles in CLV3 plants. Clearly, some CLV1 must always be present at the PM in wild-type plants in order to perceive CLV3. Consistent with this, in highly expressing IMs and FMs from CLV3 plants, we observe weak accumulation of CLV1 at the PM, suggestingthat the efﬁcacy of CLV1 trafﬁcking is sensitive to CLV1 levels. The results reported here demonstrate that CLV1 accumu- lates at the PM in both shoot and ﬂoral meristems and trafﬁcsto the lytic vacuole in a ZIG/VTI11-dependent manner. Thisappears to differ from the RLK STRUBBELIG, which accumu- lates at the PM in a domain overlapping with that of CLV1 in IMs [ 30]. Interestingly, the stem cell-limiting RLK RPK2 appears to be posttranslationally downregulated in IMs in a manner similar to CLV1 [ 15], suggesting that it may also undergo ligand-dependent trafﬁcking. Although trafﬁcking tothe vacuole is reduced in CLV3 zig-1 mutants, we also observed a consistent accumulation of CLV1-2 3GFP at the PM in CLV3 zig-1 IMs. This may reﬂect an increase in CLV1 recycling to the PM when vacuolar targeting is reduced. Thiswould be consistent with the known localization of VTI11, its role in lytic vacuole trafﬁcking, and the recent observation that the zig-1 phenotype is largely dependent on retromer- mediated resorting [ 23–26, 31 ]. CLV1 has been shown to interact in the yeast two-hybrid system with a sorting nexin,a critical component of the retromer recycling complex [32–34 ]. In addition, it has been shown that blocking lysoso- mally targeted cargo in animal systems can also induce sortinginto the recycling pathway [ 35]. It remains to be determined whether CLV1 is an actual cargo for retromer- or VTI11-depen-dent trafﬁcking. We would expect that CLV1 undergoes endocytosis from the PM prior to trafﬁcking to the vacuole. Despite several attempts, we were unable to visualize any intermediate loca- tions between the PM and vacuole accumulation. It is possible that any endosomes mediating this trafﬁc are transient and smaller in diameter than Golgi vesicles. It should be noted that we were also unable to observe any VHAa1-RFP signal, which labels the early endosome/trans-Golgi network, in the IM of Arabidopsis (data not shown), nor were we able to resolve RabC1 YFP-labeled compartments beyond a back-ground glow (wave 3, wave collection; [ 36]) despite robust imaging of these compartments in root tissues (data notshown). It has been demonstrated that, whereas transient CLV3 signaling downregulates WUS , sustained CLV3 often results in reactivation of WUS [4]. In addition, CLV3 levels can be manipulated over a wide range and still result in apparently wild-type plants [ 4]. Thus, the perception of and response to CLV3 is buffered within the growing meristem. Cytokininregulation of WUS or RLKs that counteract CLV1 may provide buffering activity [ 37, 38 ]. Ligand-induced trafﬁcking and degradation of CLV1 could also provide a mechanism for this buffering. Experimental Procedures Plant Material clv1-11 [21],clv2-1 [16], and clv3-2 [22] were as described previously and were all in the Landsberg erecta genetic background. clv1-101 is a fully recessive T-DNA insertion mutant in the Columbia background and wasobtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC)(WiscDsLox489-492B1 [ 15]).

Stem cell has immense potential in regenerative cellular therapy. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can become a potential attractive candidate for therapy due to its remarkable ability of self-renewal and di ﬀerentiation into three lineages, i.e., ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. Stem cell holds tremendous promises in the ﬁeld of tissue regeneration and transplantation for disease treatments. Globally, medicinal plants are being used for the treatment and prevention of a variety of diseases. Phytochemicals like naringin,icariin, genistein, and resveratrol obtained from plants have been extensively used in traditional medicine for centuries. Certain bioactive compounds from plants increase the rate of tissue regeneration, di ﬀerentiation, and immunomodulation. Several studies show that bioactive compounds from plants have a speci ﬁc role (bioactive mediator) in regulating the rate of cell division and di ﬀerentiation through complex signal pathways like BMP2, Runx2, and Wnt. The use of plant bioactive phytochemicals may also become promising in treating diseases like osteoporosis, neurodegenerative disorders, and other tissue degenerative disorders. Thus, the present review article is aimed at highlighting the roles and consequences of plant extracts on MSCs proliferation and desired lineage di ﬀerentiations. 1. Background Stem cells are precursor biological cells that have the ability to self-renew and di ﬀerentiate into multiple mature cells [1]. Stem cells divide into two major categories, i.e., embry- onic stem cells and adult stem cells. Depending upon the dif- ferentiation capacity, they can be classi ﬁed into unipotent, multipotent, pluripotent, or totipotent stem cells. These cellsprovide the platform to investigate cellular development,maintenance, and di ﬀerentiation [2]. In 1976, Friedenstein and his coworkers discovered MSCs from mouse bonemarrow [3]. MSCs are multipotent stem cells which are non-hematopoietic and possess the ability to di ﬀerentiate into multilineage cells. The International Society for CellularTherapy (ISCT) proposes minimal criteria to de ﬁne human MSC: they are plastic adherent; express CD105, CD73, and CD90; lack expression of CD45, CD34, CD14 or CD11b, CD79a or CD19, and HLA-DR surface molecules; and arecapable of di ﬀerentiating into multilineage cells, i.e., osteo- blasts, adipocytes, and chondroblasts in vitro [4]. HumanMSCs show morphological subpopulation like rapidly self-renewing cells, spindle-shaped cells, and ﬂattened cells (FC) [5]. Several studies have shown that under standardenvironmental condition, MSCs can be isolated from di ﬀer- ent sites including the bone marrow [6, 7], adipose tissue [8, 9], cord and peripheral blood [10, 11], placenta [12], umbilical cord [13, 14], fetal liver [15], fetal lungs [16],dental pulp [17, 18], periodontal ligament [19], trabecularbone [20], compact bone [21], synovial membrane [22],cruciate ligaments [23], amniotic ﬂuid [24, 25], and endo- metrium [26]. MSCs have been used for several clinical tri-als for tissue repairing and treating immune-mediateddisease including cardiac ischemia, limb ischemia, amyotro-phic lateral sclerosis, diabetes, ischemic stroke, osteoarthri-tis, liver cirrhosis, liver failure, graft versus host disease,Crohn ’s disease, multiple sclerosis, respiratory distress syn- drome, amyloidosis, and rheumatoid arthritis [27 –29]. At the National Institute of Health (NIH), USA, several clini-cal trials are running in di ﬀerent aspects of MSCs used for treatment and regenerative therapy. A total of 945 Hindawi Stem Cells International Volume 2019, Article ID 7513404, 13 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2019/7513404studies have been found that involve the use of MSCs for diﬀerent clinical phages among which 264 studies have been completed. Among them, some studies have useddietary supplements including herbal compounds for thetrial [30]. From the initial development of human civilization, plants have been used as a medicine for improving growthand development. Medicinal plants are widely acceptablefor the treatment of a variety of diseases. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the best sources of a variety of drugs are plant derivatives [31]. Globally, around75% of the population from the developing and developednations like Britain, Germany, and France use plants andtheir extracts as a medicine [32]. Out of 150 thousand plantsbeing studied, med-clinically important components havebeen observed in many of them [33]. Plant derivatives haveshown to promote stem cell proliferation and multilineagediﬀerentiation. The bioactive compounds obtained from plant extracts could become an alternative, cost e ﬀective treatment for bone marrow transplantation and cancer[34]. Most plants have been used both traditionally and ther- apeutically, but the exact mechanism of action on MSCs of only few plant extracts has been proved. Establishing the dif-ferentiation of MSCs into desired lineage-committed progen-itors in the presence of a certain plant extract can open anew horizon for regenerative medicine and treatment.Thus, the present review highlights the role of bioactivecompounds from plant extracts on MSCs proliferationand di ﬀerentiation and their use in regenerative therapy and medicine. 2. MSCs Proliferation Potential MSCs are divided by mitosis but are not capable of unlimitedcell division in vitro due to senescence, also called irreversiblegrowth arrest phenomenon ﬁrst described by Hayﬂ ick in the 1960s [35]. Increased expression of senescence-associatedβ-galactosidase (SA- β-Gal) is responsible for stoppage of further division of MSCs [36]. With the increase in SA-β-Gal gene expression and accumulation of excessive reac- tive oxygen species (ROS) and progressive shortening ofthe telomeres or modi ﬁed telomeric structure [35, 37, 38], morphological and biological changes occur and cellundergoes senescence. Morphologically, MSCs change into enlarged and irregular-shaped cells. Di ﬀerent studies reported that single cell-derived colonies of MSCs can expanded up to 30-50 population doublings in about 10-18weeks [39–41]. In passages 6 and 12, population doublingtime (PDT) is the shortest for umbilical cord-derived stemcell (UC-MSC) compared to bone marrow-derived stem cell(BM-MSC) and adipose tissue-derived stem cell (AT-MSC);also, the proliferation rate is the highest from UC-MSCs[42]. The proliferation and persistence rates of stem cellshave been in ﬂuenced by tissue sources, donor ’s age, and culture conditions [43]. In addition, older donor ’s cells (>66 years) have lower proliferative ability than younger ones (about <30 years of age) and pediatric donors have the high- est proliferation rate in in vitro standard condition [41, 44].Meanwhile, the absence of irreversible growth arrest couldmean neoplastic transformation of MSCs. Furthermore,the culture system also in ﬂuences homing and di ﬀerentia- tion abilities of stem cells. The three-dimensional culturesystem has more expansion than the two-dimensional cul-ture system [45]. The study has shown that UC-MSCsexhibit a higher proliferation capacity than BM-MSCs[46] and BM-MSCs have greater proliferation capabilitycompared to muscle-derived stem cells (MD-MSCs) andAT-MSCs [47]. 3. MSCs Multilineage Differentiation Potential According to ISCT criteria, MSCs must be able to di ﬀeren- tiate into multilineage cells including osteoblasts, adipo-cytes, and chondroblasts but it depends upon in vitroconditions as well as the cell source [4]. Depending upon the source, UC-MSCs have high potential to di ﬀerentiate into osteoblast, chondrocyte, adipocyte, skeletal muscle cells, endothelial cells, cardiomyocyte-like cells, and neuronalcells. BM-MSCs di ﬀerentiate into osteoblast, chondrocyte, adipocyte, tenocyte, and vascular smooth muscle cells. Inaddition, periosteum MSCs (P-MSCs), synovial MSCs(S-MSCs), adipose tissue MSCs (AT-MSCs), circulatingMSCs (C-MSCs), and tendon-derived MSCs (TD-MSCs)also have potential of multilineage di ﬀerentiation under in vitro standard condition [47]. 3.1. Adipogenic Di ﬀerentiation. Adipocyte-speci ﬁc gene expression, which brings the appearance of intracellular lipids, characterizes phenotypic adipocyte. Sequential actionof transcription factors C/EBP β(CCAAT/enhancer binding protein β), C/EBPα (CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α), and PPAR γ(peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ) is necessary for 3T3-L1 preadipocyte di ﬀerentiation [48]. Mitochondrial metabolism is important for adipocytic dif-ferentiation by increased expression of UCP-1, UCP-2, and UCP-3 mRNA. The increased level of UCP1 is associ- ated with the brown fat phenotype in newly di ﬀerentiated adipocytes [49]. In addition, ﬁbroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) and 17-beta estradiol have induced adipocyte char-acteristics in cell [50, 51]. Studies show that BM-MSCs[52], S-MSCs [53], and UC-MSCs [54] di ﬀerentiate into adipocytes. In the presence of dexamethasone and insulinsupplement in the medium, UC-MSCs di ﬀerentiate into adipocytes [54]. 3.2. Chondrogenic Di ﬀerentiation. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF- β) and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are the most important inducers for chondrogenic diﬀerentiation of MSCs [55]. The activation of the Wnt signaling pathway is also involved in chondrogenesis anddevelopment of cartilage, and this pathway is activated byglycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) [56, 57]. Several studiesshowed that MSCs from di ﬀerent sources di ﬀerentiated into chondrocytes including BM-MSCs [11, 58], S-MSCs [59], AD-MSCs [60], peripheral blood MSCs (PB-MSCs) [11], and TD-MSCs [61]. Under controlled in vitro condi-tion, supplements such as transforming growth factor- β1, ascorbate-2-phosphate, dexamethasone, and growth and2 Stem Cells Internationaldiﬀerentiation factor-5 (GDF5) [54, 62, 63] promote chon- drogenic di ﬀerentiation. Formation of shiny cell spheres which express type II collagen in cultures is the evidence for chondrogenic di ﬀerentiation of MSCs which can be demon- strated by molecular technique and immunohistochemistry. 3.3. Osteogenic Di ﬀerentiation. The two important transcrip- tion factors that promote osteoblastic di ﬀerentiation are runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) and osterix (Osx) [64]. Osterix (Osx) also called Sp7 belonging to the Sp transcription factor family is regulated by Runx2 thatspeciﬁcally binds with the Osx promoter region that regulates osteoblast di ﬀerentiation in vitro and in vivo [65]. The role of Runx2 in osteogenic regulation is by the formation of hetero-dimer with cotranscription factor core-binding factor beta(Cbf β) and binding to DNA [66, 67]. In addition, the MSC to osteogenic di ﬀerentiation increases the expression of early-marker alkaline phosphatase gene and late-markerosteopontin gene [24]. Of the di ﬀerent sources of MSCs dif- ferentiating into osteoblast-like BM-MSCs [52], S-MSCs, P-MSCs [59], or AT-MSCs [53], in vitro supplements including dexamethasone, β-glycerophosphate, ascorbic acid, and 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3 help in osteogenic di ﬀerentiation from MSCs [68–71]. The di ﬀerentiation can be demonstrated by detection of the Runx2 gene by a molecular method and also von Kossa or alizarin red staining methods. 3.4. Tendocytic Di ﬀerentiation. Tendons are tissues of mesodermal origin. MSCs are also considered promising for tendon repair in cell-based therapy. Expression of thetranscription factor Scleraxis (Scx) regulates the tendonformation [72]. Mohawk activation is essential for tendon development and to modulate the expression of Scx and tendon-speci ﬁc extracellular matrix molecules both in vitro and in vivo [73]. Another cytokine called bone morphoge-netic protein-12 (BMP-12) [74] also known as growth factorand di ﬀerentiation factor [75] is superiorly capable of pro- moting repair of tendon as well as tendon-like tissue forma-tion from MSCs. Studies showed that BM-MSCs [76] andTD-MSCs [77] can di ﬀerentiate into tendocyte. 3.5. Neurogenic Di ﬀerentiation. In a normal state, MSCs express low levels of neural gene markers, such as nestin,Nurr1, enolase 2, glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and beta-tubulin III [78]. MSCs also di ﬀerentiate into NSC-like cells under speci ﬁc culture conditions that are morphologically and phenotypically similar [79]. Thisindicates that MSCs have the capability to di ﬀerentiate into nonmesenchymal-origin cells in the presence of stimuli.In the presence of growth factors, NSCs di ﬀerentiated into the neural phenotypes: astroglia, oligodendroglia, and neu-rons [80]. Along with this, increased expression of neuronalmarkers —neuron-speci ﬁc enolase (NSE), β-tubulin III, neuro ﬁlament-M (NF-M), and microtubule-associated pro- tein 2 (MAP2) —has been observed in vitro [81]. Neuronal cells can be derived from BM-MSCs [78, 79], amniotic ﬂuid MSCs (AF-MSCs) [25], and UC-MSCs [80]. Neurons cellscan be detected by using histochemical staining for neuronalNissl bodies.3.6. Smooth Muscle Di ﬀerentiation. MSCs di ﬀerentiation into functional smooth muscle cells (SMCs) requires potential regulators miR-503 and miR-222-5p. Stimulation of trans-forming growth factor-β 1 (TGF β1) is required for genotypic and phenotypic expression and acts as a strong inducer ofmyogenic di ﬀerentiation of MSCs [82]. TGF- β3 also induces MSCs di ﬀerentiation into SMCs by activating myocardin and myocardin-related transcription factor-A (MRTF-A) [83].In addition, involvement of sphingosylphosphorylcholine induces contractile SMCs di ﬀerentiation from human adi- pose tissue-derived MSCs [84]. 4. Effect of Medicinal Plant Extracts on MSCs Globally, plants and their products are used for improving health. Plants have been providing endless sources ofmedicine throughout history. Their method of production,purpose, and method of use vary. The USA has categorizedplants into dietary supplements (intended to supplementthe diet and usually consist of vitamins and minerals), drugs(over-the-counter drugs), and botanical drugs (complex extracts used for treatment) [85]. Extracts from di ﬀerent parts of a plant (root, bark, ﬂower, leaf, and seed) may be used for di ﬀerent therapeutic purposes. Ayurveda, South-East and Middle-East Asian, and Chinese traditional medicines are the roots for use of natural products intreating diseases. Plant extracts contain bioactive com-pounds like polyphenols, ﬂavonoids, and many other compounds and chemical substances which play impor-tant roles to treat both communicable and noncommu-nicable diseases [86]. Due to health bene ﬁts, phytochemicals from plants generate a lot of interest, demanding further scienti ﬁc evaluation [87]. According to the National Institutes of Health, USA database, of the 680 clinical trials on MSCs, 27 have used dietary sup-plements including herbal compounds [86]. Natural com-pounds isolated from blueberry, green tea, catechin,carnosine, and vitamin D 3have shown to promote the proliferation of stem cell of bone marrow. Dietary fattyacids (oleic acid and linoleic acid) promote the prolifera-tion of haemopoietic stem cells [34]. Under standardin vitro condition, supplementing plant extract mayinduce increased rates of MSCs proliferation and multili-neage di ﬀerentiation, as shown in Figure 1. Moreover, studies have shown that extracts also increase pluripotentstem cell proliferation and anticancer potency. 5. Proliferation and Differentiation Stimulants Medicinal plants and herbs have always been valuable indisease treatment. Recently, researchers have investigatedand identi ﬁed those pharmacologically active substances which are responsible for disease prevention and treat-ment. Recently, medicinal plants have received consider-able attention as stimulants for stem cell proliferation in vivo and in vitro [34, 91, 92]. In vitro studies of natural bioactive compounds have suggested that plant-derivedsubstances enhance the adult stem cell proliferation andon the other hand inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells3 Stem Cells International[86]. Several studies have suggested that the proliferation ability of MSCs is in ﬂuenced by the dose of the stimulant compound, where higher doses of cellular toxicity appear.Using 1-100 μg/ml extract from a citrus increased the human BM-MSCs proliferation and osteogenic di ﬀerentia- tion, while using 200 μg/ml concentration decreases BM- MSCs growth [93]. In rat BM-MSCs, naringin 50 μg/ml concentration increased growth of MSCs and a higherconcentration at 100 μg/ml suppressed the rate of prolifer- ation [94]. In addition, extracts from brown algae Lami-naria japonica (fucoidan) enhance the proliferation of human-derived MSCs when using 0.1 –10μg/ml concentra- tion [95]. Studies have shown MSCs di ﬀerentiation into osteogenic, neurogenic, and endothelial/vascular progenitorcells in the presence of plant extract supplements. Certainphytochemicals may increase the cellular proliferation and at the same time reduce the time required, as shown in Table 1. The e ﬀects of plant extracts on MSCs di ﬀerentia- tion and their possible mechanism have been shown inTable 2.

Bioactive compound derived from plants regulates MSC gene expression, which may be responsible for the cellular proliferation and multilineagediﬀerentiation into osteocyte, muscle cells, nerve cells [86, 88], adipocyte [89], and chondrocyte [90].4 Stem Cells International5.1. Phytochemical Compounds 5.1.1. Naringin. Naringin (naringenin 7-O-neohesperidose) belongs to the ﬂavonoid group, has an antioxidant e ﬀect, is anticancerous, and is used for reducing the cholesterol level. It is also used for the treatment of bone disorders like osteoporosis and osteoarthritis. Naringin has a poten-tial to induce proosteogenic e ﬀects which could promote the proliferation of stem cell [116]. In in vitro condition,it has shown to enhance the osteogenic di ﬀerentiation by increasing the expression of Runx2, OXS, OCN, andCol1 and increase the proliferation by activating the ERKsignaling pathway on human BM-MSCs [117]. In ratBMSCs, naringin increases the mRNA levels of osteogenicgenes and Notch1 expression [94]. In human amnioticﬂuid-derived stem cells (hAFSCs), naringin promotes oste- ogenesis via BMP and Wnt-β -catenin signaling pathways. In addition, it increases the expression of bone morphoge-netic protein 4 (BMP4), runt-related transcription factor 2(Runx2), β-catenin, and cyclin D1 in a dose-dependent manner by 1-100 μg/ml [118]. At 1 μM concentration, it promotes the proliferation and di ﬀerentiation of human periodontal ligament stem cells (hPDLSCs) both in vitroand in vivo [119]. The proliferation and di ﬀerentiation are dependent on the dose of naringin in dog-originated BM-MSCs [120]. Rhizoma drynariae is used commonly in the treatment of osteoporosis and bone nonunion in traditionalChinese medicine [93]. The ﬂavanone may become a poten- tial therapeutic candidate to promote the osteogenesis. 5.1.2. Icariin. Icariin (ICA) is the main extract of Herba epi- medii which is widely used in traditional Chinese medicine(TCM). Icariin, a natural ﬂavonoid glycoside, possesses anti-in ﬂammatory (through in ﬂammatory cytokines and phosphorylation of p38 and JNK) [121], antiatherosclerosis [122], and anticancer [123] activities and treats type 2diabetes mellitus [124]. ICA promotes bone formation bystimulating osteogenic di ﬀerentiation of BMSCs. ICA can promote chondrogenic di ﬀerentiation by activating the Wnt/ β-catenin signaling pathway [90]. In rat BMSCs, prolif- eration is achieved by activating ERK and p38 MAPK signal-ing [125]. In Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, ICA has shown toincrease the phosphorylation level of GSK-3 βand cyclin D1 protein in BM-MSCs [126]. Icariside II (ICA II) is a kindof metabolite of ICA (loss of the glycosyl moiety at theC-7 position of ICA) [127]. Icariside II (ICS II) is a pre-nylated active ﬂavonol and has antiosteoporosis, antihy- poxia, and anticancer activities. ICS II increases ALPactivity and calcium deposition which enhance the osteo-genic di ﬀerentiation of BMSCs at optimal concentration [128] also via enhanced expression of osteogenesis pro-teins/genes and increases the PI3K/AKT/mTOR/S6K1 sig-naling pathways [129, 130]. It promotes osteogenesis byupregulating Runx2, ALP, and collagen I and inhibits adi-pogenesis by downregulating PPAR γ, Fabp4, and adipsin gene expression [131]. 5.1.3. Genistein. Genistein has structural similarity to human estrogen, so it is also called phytoestrogen. It is one of the most abundant iso ﬂavones in soy. Iso ﬂavones belong to the group of ﬂavonoids, and they act as phytoestrogens, antioxi- dants, and anticancer agents. Genistein when added tomedium (10 -7M and 10-8M) promotes bone formation and also increases the level of alkaline phosphatase activity andTable 1: Eﬀect of plant extract on MSC proliferation.

Genistein promotes the h-BMSCs (human-BMSCs) to osteogenic di ﬀerentiation through an ER-dependent mechanism. Also, BMP-dependent SMADsand Runx2 signaling play important roles in the process[133]. In addition, it could stimulate di ﬀerentiation through the p38 MAPK-Cbfa1 pathway [134]. However, studies haveshown that it also induces adipogenic di ﬀerentiation, pro- motes triglycerides activity in hBMSC, and suppresses osteo-genic potential by upregulating the expression of PPAY γ [89]. An in vitro study shows that genistein stimulateshMSC-induced cellular proliferation and survival of cellsand enhances antiapoptotic capacity [135]. 5.1.4. Hyaluronic Acid. Hyaluronic acid (HA) as a potential agent for medical use is already documented. HA in combi- nation with BMSCs enhances cartilage regeneration forchondral defects in canines [136]. In addition, an in vivo study done in pigs found that HA with MSCs improves the cartilage healing both histologically and morphologically at6 and 12 weeks after injection [137]. In humans, HAincreases the proliferation which is dose and time dependent.In HA-treated amniotic MSCs, upregulation of the expres-sion of the Wnt/ β-catenin pathway has been seen which enhances mRNA expression and protein level of wnt3a,β-catenin, and cyclin D1 [138]. 5.1.5. Resveratrol. Resveratrol (RSVL) is a natural type of polyphenolic phytoestrogen. RSVL is mainly found in redgrapes, blueberries, peanuts, and other plants [139]. Theeﬀect of RSVL on stem cell is well documented. It enhances the hBMSC proliferation and potential to di ﬀerentiate into osteocyte by activation of extracellular signal-regulatedkinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and p38 mitogen-activated proteinkinase (MAPK) signaling through an ER-dependent mecha-nism [140]. RSVL showed the e ﬀect on HMSCs in dose- and time-dependent manners for the self-proliferation anddiﬀerentiation. 0.1 μM RSVL promotes cell proliferation, but 5 μM or above inhibits cell self-renewal by increasing the senescence rate and cell cycle arrest in S phage. It alsohelps MSC di ﬀerentiation into osteogenic cells and sup- presses di ﬀerentiation into the adipogenic lineage [141]. Res- veratrol enhances osteogenic di ﬀerentiation by upregulating HMSC mediated through the SIRT1/FOXO3A. It activatesand enhances the proteins SIRT1 and FOXO3A, respectively,in an independent manner. Resveratrol also promotes osteo-genesis by upregulating Runx2 gene expression [142]. 6. Future Prospective Recent advancement in science and technology andadvanced research on plant extracts is bringing into lighttheir importance in regenerative and therapeutic medicine.As we know very less about the exact site and mechanismof action and side e ﬀect of the use of plant extracts, extensive research on humans will help to replace synthetic pharma- ceutical drugs to treat diseases. If protocols for proliferation and di ﬀerentiation of stem cells into desired lineage cells by use of plant extracts can be established, it will help totreat many untreatable diseases like aplastic anemia, leuke-mia, bone diseases, and cardiovascular diseases. MSCshave promising roles in regenerative therapy due to theirbroader di ﬀerentiation potential [4]. From the last few decades, scientist have been aiming to use MSCs for tissueregeneration in bone injury [143], cartilage injury [144],spinal cord injury [145], graft-versus-host disease [146],Crohn ’s disease [147], and hematopoietic cell recruitment [148]. Though very less side e ﬀects of plant extracts on humans have been noted, they may still show adverse drug eﬀects for certain medical condition which are not well known. With better knowledge of the e ﬀects of plant extracts, we may also be able to restrict their undesirable use under certain circumstances. The therapeutic dosescan also be well established to have desired e ﬀects as well as control toxic e ﬀects. Medicinal plants are being widely accepted and increas- ingly used by the general public for treatment. They are alsoused as complementary supplements to reduce the sideeﬀects produced by Western medicine [149]. The bioactive compounds derived from plants have shown to be potentialcandidates to activate stem cells for proliferation and di ﬀer- entiation. Currently, recombinant and synthetic cytokines,growth factors, and other proteins are being produced byusing bacterial cell, plants cells, and mammalian cells forstem cell growth supplement. These compounds have signif-icant side e ﬀects [150 –152] and lead to neoplastic cell trans- formations [153] with high cost, less stability, and limitedapplication and requiring continuous use making them unaf-fordable for low-income countries. Certain medicinal plantshave always been grown and used as cultural values for pri-mary health bene ﬁts. With more knowledge on values of commonly available plants in the community, it will helppeople to preserve and use them for healthy living and pre- ventive and curative medicine and also restrict undesirable use. This will decrease the health care economic burden forprimary health care problems. Thus, plant-derived com-pounds will be proven as promising agents for stem cell ther-apy for public health with easy availability and a ﬀordability and least or no side e ﬀects. 7. Conclusion MSCs along with medicinal plant extracts have a potentialhope in stem cell and regenerative therapy. Plant extracts as stimulants signi ﬁcantly a ﬀect proliferation and di ﬀerentia- tion into multilineage cells. Bioactive compounds from plants precisely regulate the MSCs through di ﬀerent protein pathways. Medicinal plants/herbs produce less toxic e ﬀects, are aﬀordable, and can help to increase disease-treating capa- bility using MSC cell therapy for both noninfectious andinfectious diseases. With continued research, by using medic-inal plant extracts, improved proliferation and di ﬀerentiation potential of MSCs will be achieved in the near future anddevelopment of cost-e ﬀective technology for cellular therapy will be possible.

"ORIGINAL PAPER Evolution of the international regulation of plant pests and challenges for future plant health Alan MacLeod &Marco Pautasso &Mike J. Jeger & Roy Haines-Young Received: 9 November 2009 /Accepted: 12 January 2010 /Published online: 23 February 2010 #British Crown Copyright 2010 Abstract Plant pathogens and invertebrates harmful to plants, collectively referred to as plant pests, continue tothreaten food security. International cooperation and regu- latory systems to inhibit the spread of plant pests began formally in 1878. Initially seven countries worked togetherand agreed phytosanitary measures against grape phyllox- era, Phylloxera vastatrix (=Daktulosphaira vitifoliae ). There are now 172 countries that are contracting parties tothe International Plant Protection Convention, a treaty that aims to prevent the introduction and spread of pests of plants and plant products, and to promote appropriatemeasures for their control. Apparently contradictory inter- ests between international trade, which has facilitated the spread of plant pests, and the protection of plants aremutually recognised in global trade and phytosanitary agreements. The principle that risk management measures should provide an appropriate level of protection withoutundue interference in trade was established within the plant protection agreements at the beginning of the 20th Century and is still fundamental to risk management policy today.Globally ten Regional Plant Protection Organizationsfacilitate more local coope ration and recommend the regulation of over 1,000 named quarantine plant pests.Member States of the European Union work together and regulate imported plant material on the grounds of plant health with each Member State taking into account the planthealth concerns of every other Member State. However, decision making can be slow and border inspections poorly targeted. Close relationships between regulatory scientistsand policy makers, focussed on agricultural and horticul- tural production, are changing to take a broader stakeholder community into consideration as decisions regarding theenvironment seek to draw upon a wider knowledge base. Challenges that impede the success of limiting international pest movement include increased international trade andclimate change. International guidelines designed to prevent pest spread present challenges of their own if they remain difficult to implement. Keywords Pest risk analysis .Phytosanitation .Plant biosecurity .Quarantine .Regulatory science Introduction Throughout history societies have incurred crop losses caused by plant diseases and invertebrate pests leading tofood shortages and hardship. Today, impacts of plant pests and pathogens still range from slight damage or mild symptoms to major catastrophes in which large areas of food crops and semi-natural vegetation are destroyed (Oerke et al. 1994 ; Scholthof 2003 ; Holdenrieder et al. 2004 ; Strange and Scott 2005 ) and there is a need to integrate knowledge of plant pests and pathogens into the food security and climate change debate (Butterworth et al.2009 ; Gregory et al. 2009 ; Miraglia et al. 2009 ). Given that A. MacLeod ( *) The Food and Environment Research Agency, Sand Hutton, York YO41 1LZ, UKe-mail: alan.macleod@fera.gsi.gov.uk M. Pautasso:M. J.

(2010) 2:49 –70 DOI 10.1007/s12571-010-0054-7the world ’s population is expected to reach 9 billion by 2045 (US Census Bureau 2009 ) the importance of reducing losses from pests and diseases is as important as ever.Diseases that directly affect crop yield and disrupt the food chain can impact on land use and social infrastructure (Aalen et al. 1997 ). For example, coffee leaf rust, caused by the pathogen Hemileia vastatrix , so devastated Sri Lankan coffee production that as an industry it became uneconomic and was eventually abandoned (Kushalappa and Eskes1989 ). This and other classic examples of plant disease impacts are described in the very accessible text by Large (1940 ). Campbell et al. ( 1999 ) provide examples with a focus on the USA. Oerke et al. ( 1994 ) examined pest induced losses in major food crops globally and estimated that without protection diseases could cause 17% losses inwheat, whilst animal pests could cause 11% losses. More recently pests and plant diseases are seen as having wider impacts on ecosystem services, for example directlythrough destruction of service providers, or indirectly as a consequence of their management (e.g. Cheatham et al. 2009 ). Faced with such potential impacts, efforts to protect plants have historically focussed on securing food supply, preventing catastrophic events such as famine, or prevent- ing farmers from suffering significant financial losses (Fry 1982 ; Hadidi et al. 1998 ; Meester et al. 1999 ). As scientific understanding and knowledge about the causes and impactsof plant pests and diseases have developed, so too have national and international efforts to control them. This review describes in some detail how the existing arrangements for the international regulation and manage- ment of non-native plant pests arose and have evolved overthe past 120 years. We demonstrate the evolution by noting developments of key international treaties and illustrate changes within selected national and regional bodiesresponsible for plant health. Changes in social values, attitudes and expectations have also occurred such that regulators can take a broader view of pests and considertheir impact in the natural environment. The challenges posed by the drivers responsible for continued pest spread are noted together with institutional challenges. To assistreaders new to this area of regulatory science, a guide to the abbreviations used within the text is provided (Table 1). In the literature, newly arrived species are variously referred to as “alien”,“exotic ”,“introduced ”,“invasive ”,“transboun- dary”,“non-indigenous ”or“non-native ”(Williamson 1996; Mack et al. 2002 ). These terms are occasionally used interchangeably. “Harmful organism ”and “pest” can also appear synonymous. Efforts to define and standardise such terminology have been made (e.g. Colautti and MacIsaac2004; Ereshefsky 2009;F A O 2009). Pest, for example is defined in FAO ( 2009)a s“any species, strain or biotype of plant, animal or pathogenic agent injurious to plants or plantproducts ”. Such a definition clearly covers invertebrates and disease causing pathogens and is used in the text from this point. What is plant health? Plant health is first of all the health, i.e. well-being, of individual plants and communities, together with their associated organisms, both in (semi)natural and cultivat- Table 1 Abbreviations used in the text Abbreviation Full name Website CBD Convention on Biological Diversity http://www.cbd.int/ CPM Commission on Phytosanitary Measures https://www.ippc.int/index.php?id=13330 EC European Commission http://ec.europa.eu/index_en.htm EFSA European Food Safety Authority http://www.efsa.europa.eu/ EPPO European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization http://www.eppo.org/ EU European Union http://europa.eu/ FAO Food & Agricultural Organization of the United Nations http://www.fao.org/ FVO Food and Veterinary Office of the EC http://ec.europa.eu/food/fvo/index_en.cfm IPPC International Plant Protection Convention https://www.ippc.int/ ISPM International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures https://www.ippc.int/index.php?id=13399&L=0 NPPO National Plant Protection Organization https://www.ippc.int/index.php?id=1110520&no_ cache=1&type=contactpoints&L=0 RPPO Regional Plant Protection Organization https://www.ippc.int/index.php?id=13310&L=0 SASA Science and Advice for Scottish Agriculture http://www.sasa.gov.uk/ SCPH EC Standing Committee on Plant Health http://ec.europa.eu/food/fs/rc/scph/index_en.htm SPS Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary measures http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/sps_e/sps_e.htm WTO World Trade Organization http://www.wto.org/50 A. MacLeod et al.ed ecosystems (Cook 2000 ; Ostry and Laflamme 2009 ; Tollefsen et al. 2009 ). However, from a biosecurity perspective, and for the purposes of this text, plant healthis a term which refers to the leg islative and administrative procedures used by governments to prevent plant pests from entering and spreading within their territories (Ebbelsand King 1979 ). Plant health includes activities sometimes referred to as “plant quarantine ”. However, plant health goes further to include health standards in schemes forproduction and marketing of h ealthy planting material, referred to as “certification schemes ”(Ebbels 1993 ). Many horticultural crops are vegeta tively propagated, potentially allowing pathogens to be transmitted to progeny. Effec- tively implementing schemes that describe how best to multiply and test plants to provide healthy planting material can be an important part of pest control and plant health risk management (Roy 2009 ). Equally important can be the management and disposal of infested plantwaste (Noble et al. 2009 ). Plant health can be regarded as a distinct component of crop protection. Typically crop protection is managed locally by growers who seek tominimise pest impacts on individual businesses. In contrast plant health is managed nationally by governments which seek to minimise the impact of exotic plant pests within their territories (Trevelyan 1993 ). Traditionally plant health has focussed on pests which are potentially harmful to agricul-tural, horticultural and forestry industries i.e. crops (Ebbels and King 1979 ). However, during the 1990s and early 21st Century, government departments and ministries have shiftedfrom a focus on production towards natural resource management and environmental protection. Consequently plant health has increasingly reached out to act against plantpests that potentially threaten the wider environment (IPPC Secretariat 2005b ; Hallman 2007 ; Holmes et al. 2008 ; Cheatham et al. 2009 ; Kelly and Bliss 2009 ). New Zealand exemplifies such an approach following the implementation of its Biosecurity Act of 1993, designed among other things to protect all of New Zealand ’s plant resources. However, agricultural production and food security issues are gaining media attention and moving back up the political agenda once again (Defra 2008a ;A m b l e r - E d w a r d se ta l . 2009 ; Frow et al. 2009 ; House of Commons Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee 2009 ; Pinstrup-Andersen 2009 ). History of plant health regulation and international agreements up to 1951 17th Century Perhaps the first phytosanitary legislation was in 17th Century Europe when the legislative authorities of Rouen, France, passed a law in 1660 requiring the destruction ofbarberry ( Berberis vulgaris ) bushes in wheat growing areas to protect wheat from a disease, later identified as black stem rust caused by Puccinia graminis (Ebbels 2003 ; Dubin and Brennan 2009 ). In countries, such as the UK, where black stem rust was not so important, destruction of barberry was left as a voluntary action, although it wassometimes encouraged. 18th & 19th CenturyThe pioneering biologist Carl Linnaeus hinted at the need for quarantine in the 18th Century (Usinger 1964 ) even at a time when only comparatively small quantities of plants were carried all over the world without restrictions. Inevitably such movements carried plant pests too. How-ever, without an understanding of plant pathology, the principles of plant quarantine were not identified as a means of mitigating the risks. Working on wheat smut(wheat bunt), Isaac-Benedict Prevost, a founding father of plant pathology, was the first to demonstrate experimentally that plant diseases were caused by micro-organisms(Prévost 1807 ). This was 25 years ahead of the first experimental proof that animal diseases were caused by pathogens. Prior to Prevost ’s experiments it was generally believed that any fungi associated with plant disease were derived from diseased plant tissue through spontaneousgeneration (Ainsworth 1981 ). The Irish potato famine of the 1840s is generally regarded as the point in time when plant pathology becamerecognised as a science in its own right. The famine occurred approximately 200 years after the introduction of potato from South America into Europe. There are manyexplanations as to the cause of the famine, but a primary factor was the over reliance on a single potato variety, cv. Lumper, that was particularly susceptible to the pathogenresponsible for potato blight, Phytophthora infestans . However, it was not until several years later that de Bary (1861 ,1865 ) firmly showed that P. infestans was the causal agent. Disease impacts were made worse by a lack of support by Anglo-Irish landowners (Salaman 1985 ). The disease also occurred at the same time in the Netherlandsand elsewhere in Europe but the impact was not as serious (Koeman and Zadoks 1999 ). The last major famine due to P . infestans was in Germany in 1916 when 700,000 civilians died. Copper that could have been used in fungicide against the pathogen was instead used to manufacture bullets for use in war (Schumann 1991 ). Other introduced plant diseases of concern in Europe during the later half of the 19th Century included Oidium (a mildew) of grapevine (1847) and Guignardia bidwelli (black rot) of grape (1888). During the same period in North America Cronartium pine rusts (1883), chestnut blight, Cryphonec- tria(Endothia) parasitica (1904) and bacterial canker ofEvolution of the international regulation of plant pests 51citrus, Xanthomonas citri (1912) were causing major impacts (Mathys and Baker 1980 ). The first international agreement to prevent the spread of a plant pest was put in place against an insect pest of grape vines. Daktulosphaira vitifoliae , then known as Phylloxera vastatrix , was accidentally introduced into Europe when a French wine merchant imported infested US vines for hybridization to his Rhône vineyards in 1862. Infested vines were also shipped to Australia (Maynard et al. 2004 ) and South Africa (Vanzyl 1984 ) at the same time, spreading the pest further. Phylloxera was also spread from California to New Zealand and Peru (Downie 2002 ). North American grape varieties were tolerant to the hemipteran pest, which formed galls on their immature roots and leaves. However, in Europe, Australia and South Africa the pest formed gallson mature storage roots and allowed secondary pathogens to infest the plants, ultimately killing the vines. Seven European countries suffering from the pest met in Berne,Switzerland in 1878, to discuss how to tackle the problem. They developed the International Convention on Measures to be taken against Phylloxera vastatrix , which was signed in September 1878 (Ebbels 2003 ). The Convention de- scribed several measures such as: providing written assurance of the Phylloxera free status of host material traded internationally, powers to inspect material and to take action on non-compliant material, and the requirementto establish an official government body to administer the implementation of such a system. An English translation of the Convention is provided in Ebbels ( 2003 ). Unfortunately the Convention used terms that were not clearly defined and, 3 years later, the countries again met in Berne and a revised Convention was signed in November 1881 con-taining definitions. 1By 1884 over 1 million hectares of French vineyards had been destroyed and over 0.6 million hectares were severely infested. The French governmentoffered a huge reward to anyone who could cure the problem (Campbell 2004 ). In Sydney, Australia, port inspections of cargo, including plants, began in 1889(Australian Academy of Science 2003 ; Maynard et al. 2004 ), the same year that a third Convention was signed, once more in Berne. Late 19th and early 20th Century At the International Congress of Agriculture and Forestry in 1890, eminent plant pathologists called for an International Phytopathological Committee. This was not the first call forinternational action on plant diseases, which appears to have come from Eriksson in 1880 (Rogers 1914 ). Despitesimilar calls at various international meetings it was not until 1903 that a special international committee for plant diseases was formed at the Seventh International Agricultural Con-gress (Rogers 1914 ). However, the committee was composed of academic scientists and no governments were represented. The first step taken jointly by governments was in June 1905with the formation of the International Institute of Agricul- ture (IIA) in Rome. The IIA made studies of international agriculture with particular reference to agricultural techni-ques, statistics, economics and legislation. It published monographs, monthly bulletins and international yearbooks. The next milestone was the 1914 International Phytopatho-logical Conference held in Rome. This event was very much driven by the French government, who had organised it, and who presided over it; French technical delegates also tookvery prominent roles. Thirty countries were represented. Some countries unable to attend had accepted in advance the need for an international convention. The British delegationaimed to include five specific points in any international convention that resulted from the meeting. 1. that plants traded interna tionally from a nursery should be officially inspected and found free from important diseases, 2. that the plants should have an official certificate of health, 3. that the health certificate should specify the diseases for which an examination had taken place, 4. that it should not be necessary for every consignment to be inspected, 5. that consignments with health certificates should not be delayed at border frontiers for inspection (Rogers 1914 ). The first four aims were apparently easily agreed to but the fifth was not achieved since countries would not agree to entirely give up the right to examine consignments on arrival. If countries signing up to the Convention had notalready established a number of plant health procedures they were, amongst other things, required to immediately: &establish an official inspection service for businesses that market plants; &issue health certificates to plants that had been inspected and found free from specified pests; &control plant movements, their packing and transport; and, &organise a service to suppress dangerous diseases. Within 2 years contracting parties were required to have established one or more institutes for research so thatgovernment could access hi gh quality scientific and technical advice. Grains, seeds, potatoes, onions and general farm produce were excluded from the Convention because it was felt that including such commodities that were already heavilytraded would overwhelm the inspection systems already in place and which already provided some protection. 1The 1881 Convention is often (mistakenly) cited as the first international plant protection agreement, when in fact it is clearly a revision of the original 1878 Convention.52 A. MacLeod et al.It was agreed that each country should compose its own list of pests against which it wished to be protected. In order to justify being placed on such a list, it was agreed that hostplants must be present in the country; that the pest could not be widespread; the pest must be able to survive on a trade pathway; and finally that the pest should be injurious to theplant, where injurious meant destructive to the commercial value of the crop. Such criteria remain at the centre of plant health thinking today. Of note, the convention was probablythe first to link scientific research with government adminis- tration, adding weight and prestige to scientists ’efforts. Early plant health policy was clearly aimed at specific pests considered to be of particular concern due to the potential damage and the apparent threat of entry. The later 1929 International Convention for the Protection of Plantsexpanded on concerns over Phylloxera to include other problematic species. At this time, the number of countries participating in such international plant protection meetingshad grown from the original seven in 1878 to 46 in 1929. Unfortunately, despite the increased interest in this area, only 12 countries ever ratified the Convention and eventssurrounding World War II meant that the 1929 Convention was not an effective instrument (Mulders 1977 ). During WWII, 44 governments meeting in the United States committed themselves to founding a permanent organiza- tion for food and agriculture. Consequently, after WWIIended, the IIA was dissolved and its functions and assets transferred to the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) that was established in 1945 as a specialized agencyof the United Nations (UN) (FAO 2008 ). During the first 5 years of the FAO ’s existence, member countries submitted proposals for an international plant protection agreement. Adraft agreement, synthesized from the representations, was considered at a meeting of FAO in The Hague in 1950 (Mulders 1977 ). The draft proposal was further developed by plant protection specialists from the USA and Canada. Following comments received during wider consultation the final draft of the International Plant Protection Conven-tion (IPPC) was eventually agreed in September 1951 and adopted during the sixth session of the FAO Conference in Rome in November 1951 (Chock 1979 ; Ebbels 2003 ). The International Plant Protection Convention since 1951 and related international agreements IPPC, 1951The IPPC is an international treaty on plant health that aims to secure action to prevent the introduction and spread ofpests of plants and plant products, and to promote appropriate measures for their control. As of December 2009 there were 172 contracting parties to the Convention.Just as the original Convention against Phylloxera was designed to prevent international movement of a pest and promote measures for pest control, the current Conventionhas similar aims. The IPPC provides a framework for international cooperation between National Plant Protection Organizations (NPPOs), the official (government) bodiesresponsible for IPPC obligations. Contracting parties follow IPPC principles, such as: &necessity (phytosanitary measures are only applied when necessary); &technical justification (measures must be technically justified); &transparency (measures must be published and the rationale for measures provided to other contracting parties if requested); &non-discrimination (measures must be applied equally to countries of equivalent plant health status and to the same pest whether associated with imported goods or within the territory of the contracting party); and, &minimal impact (measures applied must be commensu- rate to the assessed pest risk and be the least trade restrictive) (FAO 2002 ). The IPPC is governed by the Commission on Phytosani- tary Measures (CPM) and each NPPO may send represen- tatives to sit on the CPM and to help direct its work. IPPCwork falls into three general categories: 1. Setting standards: International Standards for Phytosa- nitary Measures (ISPMs) aim to reduce the spread of pests and facilitate trade through harmonizing phytosa-nitary measures applied in international trade. Exam- ples of ISPMs include, “Phytosanitary principles for the protection of plants and the application of phytosanitarymeasures in international trade ”, ISPM No. 1 (FAO 2006 ), and “Pest risk analysis for quarantine pests including analysis of environmental risks and livingmodified organisms ”ISPM No. 11 (FAO 2004 ). Adopted standards are available via the IPPC website (Table 1). Although the IPPC itself is a legally binding agreement, ISPMs are not; they are guidelines that can be interpreted in different ways. As a result disputes between nations can arise. If disputes are not settled bilaterally they can escalate and ultimately may have to be resolved through the World Trade Organization(WTO). For example, the USA disputed measures Japan had in place restricting imports of apples based on the risk of transmission of Erwinia amylovora , the pathogen causing fire blight. The WTO ultimately found that the measures in place were “without sufficient scientific evidence ”and disproportionate to the risk. Consequently Japan had to revise its import requirements (Goh 2006 ).Evolution of the international regulation of plant pests 53In recent years three or four new standards have been produced each year. The majority of ISPMs are concept standards which can be seen as providing foundations formore specific and commodity focused standards. For example, ISPM 15 describes phytosanitary measures to reduce the risk of introduction and/or spread of quarantinepests associated with wood packaging material. Diagnostic standards are currently being planned. Development of international standards for commodities such as pome fruit,stone fruit or cut flowers would remove the need for individual countries to establish their own standards. The equivalent organization in animal health, the OfficeInternational des Epizooties (OIE) takes a commodity based approach in developing its standards and has stand- ards for international trade in beef, pigmeat, poultry meatand milk (OIE 2009 ). However, it must be recognised that the OIE has very many fewer pests and diseases to concern itself with, than the very large number of plant pests ofconcern to plant health authorities. 2. Sharing information: Through the IPPC web-site, countries can share their phytosanitary regulations andinformation on the distribution of quarantine pests in their territory. However, very often reports by non- government scientists will highlight the expansion ofthe distribution of a pest before it is notified via the IPPC website. The occurrence of a quarantine pest in a country can lead to trading partners imposing importbans of host commodities (MacLeod et al. 2004 ), perhaps explaining the re luctance of countries to officially confirm the presence of some pests. 3. Technical assistance: Technical assistance can be provided to help countries implement the IPPC. Assistance can take the form of providing trainingcourses and workshops, e.g. on practical implementa- tion of ISPM 15 (IPPC Secretariat 2005a ), invasive alien species (IPPC Secretariat 2005b ) and pest risk analysis (IPPC Secretariat 2006 ). Technical assistance can also be provided through the development of documents to further explain standards, such asSupplement 1 to ISPM No. 11 (FAO 2003 ). As with previous plant protection Conventions, over time, revisions have been made, e.g. in 1979 and 1997(FAO 1997 ,2002 ). The day-to-day management, commu- nication, co-ordination and information sharing is handled by the very small IPPC Secretariat in Rome. Unlike theindependent OIE, the IPPC sits within the FAO. The IPPC Secretariat bears a heavy work load and lacks sufficient resources, both in staff numbers and technical ability, hencethe reliance on technical skills provided by members of working groups and panels from contracting parties. With a larger technical staff, dedicated to the development ofstandards, the average time for standard development couldbe reduced from the current minimum of 5 years (IPPC 2007 ). However, there is little to gain from producing ever more standards if contracting parties lack the capacity toimplement them. Future ISPMs should come with a guide on best practice for their implementation and, in order to enable them to be applied in a cost-effective manner, moreresources should be made available to support contracting parties. Convention on biological diversity (CBD), 1992 The CBD is designed to safeguard biodiversity, ensure its sustainable use and share the benefits obtained from genetic diversity. The CBD and IPPC use different terminology although the IPPC definition for a quarantine pest canoverlap with what the CBD refers to as an invasive alien species, defined as a species whose introduction and/or spread threaten biological diversity. The CBD refers to therisks of moving plants and other species between countries hence the IPPC and the CBD share and recognize some common ground and seek to find ways to cooperate, e.g.IPPC Secretariat ( 2005b ). Invasive alien plants or weeds represent a significant area of mutual concern between the CBD and the IPPC (Schrader and Unger 2003 ). A second component to the CBD is the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety (CBD 2000 ), an agreement on the use of genetically modified organisms, some of which may be plants or plant pests, and which may then overlap with IPPC concerns. SPS agreement, 1995 The IPPC makes provision for international trade within a plant protection agreement. Complementary provisions for plant protection within a trade agreement are made by theWTO in the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (WTO 1995 ), the so-called SPS Agreement (which also includes considerations of humanand animal health). These agreements seek to achieve the same ends from different directions (Lopian 2005 ). The WTO is the 1995 reincarnation of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) talks, which represent long-term global trade negotiations that seek to break down barriers and help to stimulate world trade(Durand and Chiaradia-Bonsquet 1999 ; Anon. 2004 ). Many factors contribute to the threat from exotic plant pests: increasing world trade, population mobility and tourism, anincrease in information, communication, technology and wealth in developed countries which creates a demand for exotic plant material; habitat fragmentation, which mayincrease vulnerability; and, generally, the tendency towards the globalization of the world economy (DeGraaf 1994 ; Shogren 2000 ). Waage and Mumford ( 2008 ) abbreviate54 A. MacLeod et al.these as the “four Ts ”(trade, travel, transport and tourism). Indeed globalization through trade is argued to be the fundamental human cause of invasive non-native pestintroductions (McNeely 1999 ; Perrings et al. 2000 ,2002 ; Pimentel 2002 ; Taylor and Irwin 2004 ; Koo and Mattson 2004 ). Undoubtedly international trade has grown signifi- cantly since the middle of the Twentieth Century (WTO 2007 ). At the same time the international movement of plants has also increased. The development of trade routeshas opened up new pathways for plant pests and potentially invasive species, and increased the frequency of introduc- tions (Bandyopadhyay and Frederiksen 1999 ; Ruiz and Carlton 2003 ; Anderson et al. 2004 ; Caton et al. 2006 ; McCullough et al. 2006 ; Gullino and Garibaldi 2007 ). However, Jones and Baker ( 2007 ) did not find any significant variation in the frequency or rate of introductions of plant pathogens into the UK between 1970 and 2004, despite an increase in imports over this period. The authors speculated thatthis may have been due to improvements in the health status of imports, or the effectiveness of inspection procedures at entry. Waage and Mumford ( 2008)a n dW a a g ee ta l .( 2008 ) point out that there has been little research into the patterns of pest introductions and although it may be straightforward, for example, to correlate incr eased trade with more pest introductions, there is little evidence for causation. One of the roles of the WTO is to facilitate world trade and the concomitant exchange of goods/commodities and services. However, the WTO recognises that there can be risks associated with trade, especially when biologicalentities are shipped internationally, so that species are moved to regions where they are non-native. The WTO addresses the concerns of the movement of non-nativespecies within the SPS Agreement (WTO 1995 ). Article 5 of the SPS agreement states that risk assessment protocols developed by relevant international bodies should be used,as appropriate to the circumstances, to determine the risks associated with trade and to develop protective measures to mitigate the risks. Protective measures should, amongstother things, be scientifically based and be as unrestrictive of trade as possible (Anderson et al. 2001 ; McRae and Wilson 2002 ). To account for the extensive and persistent uncertainty around pests that can be spread internationally the WTO promotes learning, encourages monitoring of outcomes, encourages transparency, facilitates broad partic-ipation in policy-making processes, and highlights the limitations of the knowledge used to inform policy (Cooney and Lang 2007 ). Following the establishment of the WTO and the SPS Agreement, the FAO recognised that plant protection legislation would be significantly impacted, particularly with respect to trading practices, with con-sequences for food security (Durand and Chiaradia- Bonsquet 1999 ) given more rigid conditions might be applied before commodities could be shipped. The WTO recognisesthe IPPC as the relevant body to develop risk assessment protocols for plant health. While the SPS Agreement implies the need for technical justification and non-discrimination, theIPPC sets out these concepts as detailed principles (Hedley 1992 ; Smith 1999 ). In theory the SPS Agreement and the IPPC provide a framework for a multilateral trading systemin plants and plant commodities (van der Graaff 1999 )b u ti n practice trading partners may still have to arrange bilaterally how IPPC standards are to be applied in practice (Smith 1999 ). Figure 1illustrates where these international bodies and agreements overlap and interact. Whilst Fig. 1shows the inter-relatedness of three major international agreementsprotecting plant health, there are nearly 50 international legal instruments or guidelines that deal with the related but wider issue of invasive alien species (Shine 2007 ). Economic rationale for government intervention At the local scale, combating plant pests is an economic necessity for farmers and decisions are generally made byindividual growers. Pest prevention is based on good agronomic practice, rotation, use of pest free seed (which could be assured through certification systems organised bythe NPPO), breeding for resistance to pests, good nutrient and water balance, and ensuring that plants do not become stressed and vulnerable. However, for non-native pests that threaten crops or plants in the wider environment or even plants in other countries, government intervention can bejustified economically. Perrings et al. ( 2002 ) argue that the primary driver of the introduction of non-native s pecies, resulting in some becoming invasive pests, is economics. Therefore, any analysis of the process from potential introduction to invasiveness must consider the economic infrastructure in Protecting wild flora Trade while protecting biodiversity From an ori ginal dia gram b y Lesle y Cree, Canadian Food Ins pection A gencyTradeLMOsNo more trade restrictive than necessaryLMOs  identified as pests  Biological diversityPlant protection Fig. 1 Links between international agreements protecting plant health.

With knowledge of the growing environment and management practices employed, export growers may well be aware of the healthstatus of their plant products. However, this is not the case for importers since it can be difficult to detect plant pests and assess plant health condition. Thus it may be only aftera period of time that a judgement can be made as to the quality of the material. In economic parlance, such a situation is referred to as information asymmetry, and istypical for “post-experience goods ”(Boardman et al. 1996 ) which can cause market failure. If importers cannot easily identify pests in plants and plant products, and assumingthat higher levels of plant health (e.g. pest freedom) are more costly to achieve due to quarantine treatments, then there will be an incentive for exporters to supply riskierproducts (Akerlof 1970 ). Negative externalities, e.g. dam- aging impacts to crops and the environment by pests introduced via plant imports for which the importer bearsno cost would also be present. Hence, there is a role for government to intervene to ensure some form of quality assurance is provided. Infrastructures and services to protectagainst non-native pests are a public good that can only efficiently be provided by government (Temple et al. 2000 ). In a review of Australian quarantine, Nairn et al. ( 1996 ) recognised that commercial businesses would not choose to provide plant health services. More significantly it isgovernments that sign the relevant international agree- ments and only governments can take certain regulatory actions under such international agreements. There aremany ways in which government can intervene. In the phytosanitary arena, these include establishing a plant protection service to impose phytosanitary regulations, toorganise quarantine services, to conduct research, to collect and provide information and to administer voluntary schemes (Temple et al. 2000 ). A national example of the evolution of plant health regulation Great Britain: late 19th and early 20th CenturyTo illustrate the issues at a national level we review plant health regulation in Great Britain. Having established therationale for government intervention, the history of plant health regulation in Britain began in August 1877 with the Destructive Insects Act. This had the objective of prevent-ing the introduction and establishment of the major potato pest Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Colorado potato beetle). At the time L. decemlineata was known to have spread rapidly in the US. It had been found in Continental Europe in 1876 and, when a single beetle was found at Liverpool docks in 1877, it was clear that there was a pathway forentry of the pest into the UK (Bartlett 1979 ). Thirty years later the legislation was extended to cover other insects and fungi that were plant pests, although the Destructive Insectsand Pests Act of 1907 was mainly intended to prevent entry ofSphaerotheca mors-uvae (American gooseberry mildew) on imported plants (Ebbels and King 1979 ). Plant patho- genic bacteria and viruses were first included in British plant health legislation 20 years later in the Destructive Insects and Pests Act of 1927. As part of the measures tocontrol potato wart disease, a seed potato certification scheme was started in 1918 (Ebbels 2003 ). Great Britain: later 20th Century All the Acts were subsequently consolidated in the Great Britain Plant Health Act 1967 (Trevelyan 1993 ). The Act of 1967 recognised three competent authorities responsible for plant health. In England and Wales the Minister ofAgriculture Fisheries and Food was responsible for agri- cultural and horticultural material; in Scotland it was the Secretary of State, whilst the Forestry Commissioners wereresponsible for forest trees and timber in Scotland, England and Wales. Ebbels ( 2003 ) described the rather fragmented nature of the UK National Plant Protection Organization (NPPO), noting its federal composition and how adminis- trative and technical services are provided for phytosanitaryservices in England, Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales, the Channel Islands and Isle of Man. In England and Wales plant health service scientists within the Food and Envi-ronment Research Agency (Fera), an executive agency of the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) conduct research to improve methods of pestdetection, identification and diagnosis (e.g. Hughes et al. 1997 ; Lane et al. 2007 ; Boonham et al. 2008 ); evaluate the threat from exotic pests through risk assessment (Baker etal.2005 ), identify research needs to reduce uncertainty in such assessments (Sansford 1999 ; Sansford et al. 2008 ) and evaluate pest risk management measures (Cannon et al.1999 ,2007 ). Resulting information is shared with stake- holders via mail shots and increasingly via official websites. 2Similar work is performed in Scotland by SASA (Science and Advice for Scottish Agriculture). Despite the apparent complex organizational arrangements for plant health in the UK, Brasier ( 2008 ) concluded that the UK system works reasonably efficiently and operates to a high standard, although its focus on only regulating organisms that are already recognized pests was now questionable andthat more attention should be paid to exotic species, not yet known to be harmful. However, regulators need to consider the“weight of evidence ”before allocating scarce public 2Fera Plant Health website: http://www.fera.defra.gov.uk/plants/plant Health/ .56 A. MacLeod et al.resources to protect plant health. Incursions of known pest species will demand regulators ’attention as a priority over the arrival of organisms with no history of being harmful.Nevertheless, there may be a role for species traits analysis to be used to identify potential pests (Leung et al. 2002 ; Kenis et al. 2007 ). At the time when international efforts to control the spread of plant pests first began to be discussed, Britain was the world ’s leading trading nation, shipping commodities around the globe (Chapman 1992 ). At the same time, Britain was at the forefront of the early development of international agreements on plant protection. Given thattrade is largely responsible for the spread of plant pests internationally, these two apparently contradictory interests have been balanced by the UK consistently taking apragmatic approach, advocating that measures should provide a sufficient level of plant health protection without undue interference with trade. This principle, which the UKwished to ensure became established within the plant protection agreements at the beginning of the 20th Century, is still fundamental to the IPPC 100 years later. Moreformally such an approach is considered as managed risk. A key component of providing well-informed risk manage- ment measures is to a have a well-informed assessment of risk, which consists of an assessment of likelihood and consequence (MacLeod 2007 ). As shown above, early plant health policy was aimed at specific pests but legislation was later expanded to include other species of concern. Most countries developed theirphytosanitary legislation in a similar way, first focusing on individual pests before creating more general legislation (Temple et al. 2000 ). In the USA it was individual States that led the development of plant health regulation with the Michigan Yellows Law of 1875, targeting Peach yellows phytoplasma, being an early example. Not until the PlantQuarantine Act of 1912 was t here federal legislation covering many pests (Ainsworth 1981 ). European integration When the United Kingdom joined the European Commu- nity in 1973, plant health regulations were still fundamen- tally a national responsibility and there was little in the form of an integrated European strategy towards planthealth within the single market. Therefore the 1967 Act continued to be the principal legal instrument providing plant health protection in Britain. Forty-one statutoryinstruments made under various acts were consolidated into the Plant Health (Great Britain) Order in 1987. Not until very late in December 1976 was there a harmonised EC regime to regulate trade for plant health purposes through the Plant Health Directive 77/93/EEC (Anon. 1977 ). The Directive was one of the most complexpieces of EC legislation, taking 19 years from first discussions and planning to its final implementation in May 1980 (Baker and Pemberton 1993 ). The 1976 system covered intra-community trade in plants and plant products and their imports from non-EU Member States (referred to as Third Countries). Amongst other things, 77/93/EEClisted those plants and plant products that were prohibited from entry into the Community and those requiring phytosanitary certificates, and pests whose introductionand spread within the Community was banned (Savage 1993 ). Third country material had to meet EC minimum standards but more stringent national standards were stillpermitted (Bartlett 1994 ). Thus plants traded across EU borders were still subject to checks at national customs posts, a practice inconsistent with the concept of a single market.Implementing a single EU market for plants required substantial legislative amendments to 77/93/EEC, described by Vereecke ( 1993 ). The amendments culminated in the creation of the single market for plants and plant products in 1993 whereby EU wide requirements for plant health became harmonized. Rather than plants and plant materialbeing checked at national borders, EU producers wishing to market such goods in other Member States had to register with the NPPO. Official inspections of controlled material bound elsewhere in the EU would be made, and if the material met the plant health requirements it was issued witha“plant passport ”. In England and Wales such duties were, and still are, performed by the Plant Health and Seeds Inspectorate (PHSI) (Ward 1993 ) which is now part of Fera. Not all plants or plant material are subject to such require- ments. Instead it is usually restricted to plant propagating material such as cuttings, rootstocks, seedlings and youngplants for planting, bulbs, corms and seed potatoes, and other selected material including wood and Citrus clementina fruit with leaves (Vereecke 1993 ). The removal of internal border controls between EU Member States means that once material has been cleared through an external border, it should be able to be moved without hindrance anywherewithin the EC on the single market principle. As with all EC Directives, which are not self-executing, the amended 77/93/ EEC Directive laid down reforms needed in Member States ’ domestic legislation. In the UK, Parliament implemented 77/ 93/EEC, as amended, through the Plant Health (Great Britain) Order 1993. The introduction of the single marketforced a major shift in thinking about plant health from protecting national interests to protecting the wider European Community. Given the large number of amendmentsmade, 77/93/EEC was consolidated into Council Direc- tive 2000/29/EC of 8 May 2000 on protective measures against the introduction in to the Community of organ- isms harmful to plants or plant products and against their spread within the Community, also known as the Plant Health Directive.Evolution of the international regulation of plant pests 57There are weaknesses in the Plant Health Directive of a philosophical and historical nature. Philosophically, any plants not regulated by the Plant Health Directive areallowed entry into the EU with minimal regulation. Hence trades and pathways of which there is no prior experience develop with little scrutiny, posing plant health risks, andsometimes it is only after those risks are realised and new pests have become established that risk management measures are applied. Conversely risk management meas-ures continue to be applied against some trades which have a long record of compliance and pose very low risk (e.g. apples from New Zealand and USA). When pests andplants were regulated by the original Directive 77/93/EEC, Europeans largely traded with former colonial partners. There was limited information about the pests of countriesthat have now emerged to be major trading nations, exporting increasingly large volumes of plants and plant products. Consequently the EU is now being confrontedwith progressively more pests from the Far East. However, any radical change to the current EU philosophy has the potential to create trade disputes within the WTO under theSPS agreement and is likely to be opposed by some trade interests within the EU. The European Commission drives European policy on plant health through its chairmanship of the Standing Committee on Plant Health (SCPH) that meets with NPPOrepresentatives regularly through the year in Brussels (Bartlett 2000 ). That is not to say that the UK has a diminished role in determining national plant health policy.Indeed UK officials do influence the SCPH and can influence the development and revision of EU policy and legislation (e.g. MacLeod and Baker 1998 ; Sansford 1998 ; Bartlett 2000 ; MacLeod et al. 2002 ,2005 ). Use of legislation is not the only mechanism available by government to protect UK plant health. Codes of Practicesuch as the “Plant health code of practice for the management of agricultural and horticultural waste ” (MAFF 1998 ; Defra 2008b ) and “Horticultural code of practice: Helping to prevent the spread of invasive non- native species ”(Defra 2005 ) have been developed with industry sectors. Undertaking wide consultation andthrough joint working with stakeholders in developing such codes of practice, leads to a greater acceptance of change (Ashby et al. 2005 ) which, through rigid legal enforcement, may otherwise be more challenging. More inclusive decision makingTraditionally, in science-led government departments and ministries dealing with agriculture, food and the environ-ment, decision-making has resulted from the interaction of scientists and policy advisors. However, significant unan- ticipated effects of disease outbreaks can result in loss ofpublic trust in government management and administration of outbreaks (Scott et al. 2004 ). Using narrow science- centred decision-making approaches has resulted in highprofile failures and ‘crises ’of public legitimacy, confidence and trust (Woods 2005 ). In the light of high profile breakdowns in public confidence over animal health issuesimpacting on human health, van Zwanenburg and Millstone (2005 ) have called for a reorganization of science-based risk policy-making. By viewing rural areas through anagricultural lens, governme nt failed to appreciate the presence of other communities and stakeholders that may be affected in the countryside (e.g. those involved in ruraltourism and related sectors). Attempts to combat Foot and Mouth Disease caused major unforeseen economic impacts because not all receptor communities and stakeholders wereidentified (Donaldson et al. 2002 ). Some recent commenta- tors question the pre-eminence of scientific experts when it comes to environmental decision-making (e.g. Irwin 1995 ; Bryant and Wilson 1998 ). They have argued that environ- mental decision making has to be grounded on partnerships between experts, policy advisers and stakeholders, and thatmore inclusive or participatory approaches are needed to ensure that account is taken of other types of knowledge, beyond that associated with the scientific and technical realm (e.g. Burgess et al. 1998 ; Irwin 2001 ; Kapoor 2001 ; Kates et al. 2001 ;O’Riordan 2000 ; Wilson and Bryant 1997 ). Some commentators argue that new types of scientific dialogue are emerging, which they refer to variously as ‘sustainability science ’(Kates et al. 2001 ; Moll and Zander 2006 )“citizen science ”and“post-normal science ”(Nowotny et al. 2001 ; Potschin and Haines-Young 2006 ). Figure 2suggests a framework in which much applied science, or at least that applied science which seeks to inform or support policy, is now set. Future legislation and management of the risks presented by non-native plantpests may have to take account of such attitudes and continue to build stakeholder consultations into protocols for decision making. There is now widespread acknowl-edgement that while evidence-based policy must be based                                                            Fig. 2 Developing environmental policies —key players and their interaction58 A. MacLeod et al.on the best science, it must also take account of wider social and economic contexts in which that knowledge is set and used (Anon. 2006 ). The importance of citizen science in the issue of invasive diseases has been recognised by Crowl et al. ( 2008 ). However, plant pests and plant health have a relatively low public profilecompared with animal pests and diseases and engaging the public over plant health matters will remain a challenge whilst public awareness is low. Just as in the UK, other European nations recognise that agriculture has a multifunctional role, e.g. it covers various policy objectives, such as the maintenance of food supply,has the ability to supply non-market public goods especially with respect to the environment (positive externalities), and maintains the viability of rural areas (FAO 2001 ). Norway specifically values agriculture in that it also can help preserve cultural heritage (WTO 1999 ). For these reasons, environmental decision making, including plant healthpolicy decision-making, has to engage with a broader community of users than those traditionally consulted. Although the EC has consulted interested parties duringpolicy development in the past, up until 2002 there was no standard Commission-wide approach on how to undertake consultations. In December 2002 the Commission adopted a number of principles that should govern its relations with stakeholders and a set of minimum standards for theCommission ’s consultation processes. Subsequently the Commission contracted independent consultants to work with stakeholders in order to evaluate the Europeanlegislation governing the marketing of seeds and plant propagating material within the European Union (FCEC 2008 ). An example at the national level is seen in the UK where government has adopted a policy of more transparent consultation. The Better Regulation Executive, part of the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Re-form, aims to work with regulators and other government departments to change attitudes and approaches to regula- tion, to become more risk-based, and to improve the waysin which new regulations are communicated. Regional context: wider European cooperation European and Mediterranean Plant Protection OrganizationSome plant pests have been found to spread significantly during periods of war and social upheaval (FAO 2001 ). In Europe, Colorado beetle spread significantly during WWII (Bartlett 1979 ). At a meeting in Paris in April 1951, officials from 15 governments met and agreed to combinethe responsibilities of the International Committee for the Control of Colorado Beetle with the activities of the European Working Party on Infestation Control, thatworked on pests of stored foods and rodent pests of crops, thereby forming The European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization (EPPO) (EPPO 1951 ;S m i t h 1979 ). The first specific pests to be given special attention by EPPO were Colorado beetle ( L. decemlineata ), potato root eelworm (Heterodera rostochiensis ), San Jose scale ( Diaspidiotus (as Aspidiotus )perniciosus ) and potato wart disease (caused by Synchytrium endobioticum ). More generally “insect, fungus and rodent pests of stored foods, and rodent pests of crops ” were also within the scope of EPPO work. EPPO has its headquarters in Paris and since 1951 EPPO membership has grown from 15 countries to 50 (Table 3). Over the same period the number of plant pests EPPO has an active interest in has grown to over 330. Today EPPO aims to develop an international strategy against the introduction and spread ofpests that damage cultivated and wild plants in natural and agricultural ecosystems (Petter et al. 2010 ); encourage harmonization of phytosanitary regulations and all otherareas of official plant protection action; promote the use of modern, safe, and effective pest control methods; and, provide a documentation service on plant protection. Through suchaims, EPPO can inform and facilitate collaboration in support of the role of NPPOs in the European and Mediterranean region with regard to the technical justification of phytosani- tary measures, sustainable and effective plant protection practices and scientifically-based harmonization of phytosani-tary methods and procedures. EPPO achieves its aims by setting regional standards for phytosanitary measures and plant protection products, recommending pests for regulation,organizing specialist meetings bringing together experts from all parts of the EPPO region, participating in global activities related to phytosanitary measures coordinated by the IPPC Secretariat within FAO, organizing international conferences and workshops for plant protection researchers and practi- tioners, publishing the journal EPPO Bulletin ,p r o v i d i n ga n electronic documentation service through the EPPO Report- ing Service and distributing database systems. EPPO is one of ten Regional Plant Protection Organizations (Table 2). Membership of each RPPO is shown in Table 3. Collective- ly, the RPPOs recommend that over 1,000 pests be regulated (EPPO 2007 ). RPPOs work with the IPPC suggesting subjects around which ISPMs can be developed, identifying regional experts to help draft standards and organizing consultations on outputs. It must be recognized that EPPO does not regulate pests, rather it makes recommendations about which pests to regulate. Whilst EPPO and the EU authorities have workedtogether to harmonize lists of quarantine pests, the speed of regulatory decision making within the EC is a weakness within the European plant health regime, e.g. the polyph-agous white fringed weevil Naupactus leucoloma , a pest of many field vegetable crops that has spread from South America into South Africa, Australia, New Zealand and theEvolution of the international regulation of plant pests 59USA, was first recommended by EPPO for regulation in 1998 but not added to EC legislation until 2004. Unfortu-nately the lack of rapid decision making can allow pests to arrive, establish and spread before sufficient measures are in place to inhibit their arrival, making eradication lesslikely. For example, the South American tomato moth, Tuta absoluta , was first recommended by EPPO for regulation in 2004 at a time when it was not present in any European orEPPO country. However, it was not added to EC legisla- tion. Outbreaks of the pest occurred on tomatoes in Spain in 2007 and by 2009 it had spread and outbreaks werereported in France, Italy, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Switzerland and UK (EPPO 2009 ). Any attempt to eradicate T. absoluta within Europe will now be prohibi- tively expensive. European Food Safety AuthorityFollowing a series of events where the public lost confidence in aspects of food safety in Europe in the late1990s (e.g. Vos 2000 ; Pennington 2003 ), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) was established in January 2002 to act as an independent source of scientific advice andto communicate risks associated with the food chain. The remit within EFSA ’s founding regulation (EC 178/2002) covered food and feed safety, nutrition, animal health andwelfare, plant protection and plant health. EFSA produces scientific opinions and advice on subjects within its remit to inform European policies and legislation through the work ofits various scientific panels. Panel members are drawn from experts across Europe. The EFSA Panel on Plant Health (PLPH), first formed in 2006, specifically aims to helpdecision making with respect to the risk posed by pests that cause harm to plants, plant products or biodiversity. To rebuildpublic confidence EFSA stresses that it operates in a very transparent manner and that it is independent of riskmanagement decision makers, e.g. independent from the European Commission. Due to their mutual interest in pest risk assessment and the evaluation of risk managementmeasures, EFSA and EPPO have taken steps to recognise and acknowledge their respective roles and senior staff from EPPO and EFSA have met and an agreement to avoidduplication of effort, while still maintaining EFSA indepen- dence, is planned. Future challenges to plant health Drivers of pest spread The drivers responsible for the continued international spread of plant pests will not easily be halted. Brasier (2008 ) calls for a substantial reduction in the international trade of plants as the best means of reducing threats frompests moving to new geographic regions. Whilst this would without doubt reduce pest spread, it is very unlikely that trade will be significantly reduced in the near future. In asimilar vein, a more measured output from the Conference of the Parties to the CBD, was the invitation to the WTO Committee on Trade and the Environment to consider theeffects of the spread of invasive species when assessing the impacts of further trade liberalization (CBD 2002 ), although this was also in relation to climate change (CBD2002 ). Pests also spread as a consequence of war or conflict. Civil unrest has permitted many introduced pests to spreadrapidly. Factors contributing to pest spread in conflict zones include the lack of border controls and the increasedTable 2 Regional plant protection organizations Abbreviation Full name Geographic region covered Approximate number of pests recommended for regulationa APPPC Asia and Pacific Plant Protection Commission Asia and Pacific 254 CAN Comunidad Andina South America I 77COSAVE Comité regional de sanidad vegetal para el Cono Sur South America II 147CPPC Caribbean Plant Protection Commission Caribbean 419EPPO European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization Europe and Mediterranean 337IAPSC Interafrican Phytosanitary Council Africa 137NAPPO North American Plant Protection Organization North America (403) b NEPPO Near East Plant Protection Organization Middle East 23OIRSA Organismo internacional regional de sanidad agropecuaria Central America 250PPPO Pacific Plant Protection Organisation Pacific 147 aA-S.

The agreement for the creation of NEPPO was signed in 1993 and entered into force on 8 January 2009 with 12 countries having deposited their ratification or accession withFAO ( http://www.fao.org/legal/treaties/024S-E.HTM )Table 3 (continued)Evolution of the international regulation of plant pests 61unregulated movement of military personnel, equipment and supplies, such as emergency food aid carrying pests from outside the conflict zone.

It has been suggested that D. virgifera virgifera was first introduced in 1990 by military air transport from North America (EPPO 1996 ). Bioterrorism Although use of plant pests by criminals or terrorists is rare (Zilinskas et al. 2004 ) their use could spread pests more widely and new sources of potential threat have been identified through assessment of the use of pests forbioterrorism (Madden and Wheelis 2003 ). Plant pests can be used as weapons and be deliberately introduced to reduce food security or have a more indirect impact on anations ’economy e.g. by denying access to lucrative export markets. Developing plans for emergency preparedness has enabled scientists to obtain substantial funds from US government sources (Madden and Wheelis 2003 ; Meyerson and Reaser 2003 ). In developing procedures to counter such threats, spin-off benefits are to be expected for more conventional plant pathologists and future prevention and management systems will be strongly influenced by newtechnology and the growing role of the private sector (Waage and Mumford 2008 ). Climate change Now that the weight of scientific evidence about the causes of climate change has been widely accepted (IPCC 2007 ; Nielsen-Gammon 2007 ), and it is recognised that climate change can facilitate the spread and localseverity of pests (Cannon 1998 ; Baker et al. 1998 ;B a k e r et al. 2003 ;S c h e r m 2004 ; Simberloff 2006 ;S u t h e r s te ta l . 2007 ;S u t h e r l a n de ta l . 2008 ; Ghini et al. 2008 ), pests can be expected to continue to change their distribution as changes in ecological conditions associated with climate change increase the susceptib ility of hosts in new areas. It is also legitimate to consider reviewing existing risk analyses that formed the basis of trade-permitting or trade-restricting decisions (Committee on World FoodSecurity 2005 ). However, whilst climate change can cause pests to expand their ranges, a pests ’impact at the margin of its distribution may well be lower than its impact at thecore of its distribution (e.g. Zocca et al. 2008 ). It will therefore be important to assess the impact of climate change on potential pests on a case by case basis.Institutional challenges: implementation of standards Shine ( 2007 ) noted that a technical review of the international regulatory framework designed to prevent the spread of invasive alien species, which can include plant pests, did not reveal any inadequacies but instead foundproblems with inadequate implementation. Implementation can be hampered nationally when government departments have different and conflicting goals, e.g. departments ofagriculture or trade that have a primary interest in production, versus departments responsible for conserva- tion. Internationally issues of concern include the lack of coordination between neighbouring countries, regional free trade agreements which relax or remove border controls, low public awareness, few deterrents to those that introducerisk agents, and constraints on funding giving rise to a lack of resources to operate comprehensive quarantine and risk assessment systems. Recognising that the threat from non-native pests is persistent and of global relevance, interna- tional cooperation and policies that support efforts to mitigate the risks are essential. Developing good governanceAround the world today in many developing and transition countries, establishing appropriate plant health legislation,and having an official system to control its quality and reliability, is a major challenge (Vallat and Mallet 2006 ). As a result many countries have no effective NPPO. The majorinfrastructure required by a country to develop an effective NPPO can be determined through use of the FAO phytosani- tary capacity evaluation tool (ICPM 2004 ). Improved international cooperation is noted as being a key way to deal with global threats such as food security (Epstein 1997 ). The interdependence of countries required to tackle pestsleads developed nations to support developing countries in improving capacity to deliver such services. For example Australia and New Zealand place a high priority in helpingbuild sanitary and phytosanitary capacity in neighbouring ASEAN countries, and this provides Australia and New Zealand with opportunities to take action offshore to mitigatethreats posed by exotic pests (Anon. 2008 ). Countries that have acceded to the EU since 2004 have taken part in “twinning projects ”where they partner a more established Member State in order to develop their plant health regime and harmonise it with EC requirements. In preparation for further expansion of the EU, the Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) evaluates the phytosanitary capabilities of each candidate country and the EU Technical Assistance Information Exchange Unit (TAIEX) facilitatesassistance for these and pre-accession countries. 3It will 3TAIEX website: http://taiex.ec.europa.eu/ .62 A. MacLeod et al.require major investment to improve plant health and border controls for countries such as Turkey (Schmidt 2006 ). In addition to issues of plant health risk manage- ment, plant commodities that are foods have additional food safety controls to comply with. Food safety regu- lations can have a major impact on food security. Anhistorical review of the development of food safety legislation is beyond the scope of this study, other than to note that in addition to legislative requirements, privateinterests are key drivers of food supply chains and they have led to the institutionalisation of standards-setting and quality requirements (Barling 2007 ). The European Com- mission has recognised the interdependence of food safety, animal feed and plant health by organising them within a single Directorate General —SANCO (Santé et Consomma- teurs), including having a combined inspectorate, the FVO. Challenges in AfricaTo improve the management of risk in plant health and contribute to better food security in Africa, efforts todevelop systems of “open quarantine ”, allowing interna- tional exchange of disease resistant varieties of plant material, have been made. Implicit in the term open quarantine is the setting of phytosanitary protocols that do not require plant confinement in structures such as secureglasshouses or screenhouses during a period of quarantine. Such a system was viewed as appropriate for Africa where the need to introduce new plant varieties is strong butwhere quarantine infrastructure in many countries is weak. The technique was initially used successfully in East and Central Africa (Mohamed 2003 ; Danson et al. 2006 ) with the international exchange of high quality cassava material resistant to African cassava mosaic virus , used to alleviate impacts of the devastating cassava mosaic disease out-breaks of the early 1990s. However, since late 2004 Cassava brown streak virus (CBSV) has been spreading in East Africa via infected propagating material and to alesser extent by Bemisia tabaci , a whitefly vector. CBSV can be a devastating pest responsible for loss of cassava root quality and yield but it is difficult to detect since foliarsymptoms are not conspicuous. Due to the limited diagnostic capability to identify CBSV within quarantine stations there was a call for the restriction of movement ofcassava cuttings through the open quarantine system (Ntawuruhunga and Legg 2007 ). Individually many African countries do not have the capacity to provide technicalplant health services (Smith et al. 2008 ) or comply with international phytosanitary standards and are consequently excluded from lucrative export markets. Lack of capacity alsoinhibits a nation ’s ability to deal with invasive pests potentially threatening local food security. To address some of these issues, East and South African countries are co-operating toestablish a regional Centre of Phytosanitary Excellence (CoPE) based in Nairobi, Kenya. The CoPE aims to establish a phytosanitary information management system and build aplant inspection facility, both as a demonstration and training resource. Some infrastructure changes will be required to set up the legal and institutional framework within which theCoPE will operate (Otieno 2008). Detection and monitoringEven with ISPMs adequately implemented, as the four Ts mentioned previously continue to grow, each will continueto present challenges for regulators and especially put pressure on border inspections. A study comparing those species that were intercepted by phytosanitary services inAustria and Switzerland between 1995 and 2004, with species that established over the same period showed that only 10% of species that established were ever intercepted(Kenis et al. 2007 ), evidence that better targeting of pathways to detect incursions are needed. There has been much work on network epidemiology that suggests that ifthe number of business to business links varies greatly between individual businesses, then targeting control towards super-connected traders may be a more effective way to reduce the risk of introduction of new pests than a slightly increased control of all potential pathways (Jeger et al. 2007 ; Harwood et al. 2009 ; Moslonka-Lefebvre et al. 2009 ). It is not only imports that are important in spreading non-native pests. Movement of plants within a singlecountry can have impacts for plant health, as illustrated by the spread of P . ramorum through US and UK nurseries (Stokstad 2004 ; Xu et al., 2009 ). Equally a plant health campaign against a pest can be inhibited if the pest develops resistance to a particular treatment. For example, in New York State Erwinia amylovora was reported as being resistant to streptomycin following movement of plants from Wisconsin (Russo et al. 2008 ). Development of nation-wide monitoring systems (e.g. Delos et al. 2007 ; Tkacz et al. 2008 ), can provide early indications of emerging pests and, if maintained consistently through time, could also provide much needed long-term data,in relation to the impact of pests and of climate change. Long- term datasets, where they exist, are invaluable in predicting threats to plant health from global factors, including climatechange (Jeger and Pautasso 2008 ). Nationwide monitoring schemes are now common for biodiversity, and there are great benefits to be gained if pests were to be included inthese surveys (Desprez-Loustau et al. 2010 ). However, the general shortage of taxonomists, recognised as the “taxo- nomic impediment ”(Hoagland 1996 ) could constrain the development and potential benefits of such surveys, for example, by allowing invasive pests to remain undiagnosed and hence lose opportunities for appropriate interventions.Evolution of the international regulation of plant pests 63Weight of evidence Baker and MacLeod ( 2005 )r e c o g n i s e dt h a tl a c ko fd a t a presented significant and ongoing challenges to those charged with assessing the risk of non-native pests. Precautionary action has often been used in public health where the publicreceive the benefit of the doubt. However, the application of such an approach to environmental hazards only emerged the end of the 20th Century (EEA 2001 ). Identifying when there is sufficient evidence in order to regulate a pest has, and will continue to be, a major difficulty. However, waiting until there is conclusive evidence before making a decision toregulate a pest is likely to lead to the pest becoming more costly to manage since it is likely to spread whilst evidence is being collected. Conclusions Plant pests have always threatened food security and as our understanding of pests began to develop, so too did theregulatory systems to control them. The present interna- tional model for plant protection was founded at a time when the primary focus was on protecting crops. Therewere fewer trading nations, transport was slower and there was less diversity in the range of plants and commodities traded. Whilst perhaps more appropriate in earlier times, current plant health regimes face the constant challenge of preventing pest spread whilst operating within agreementsand following guidelines that can be slow to change and difficult to implement. Developing nations, not burdened by established systems, that have recently begun to buildtheir own plant protection regimes would benefit from sharing resources and cooperating with neighbouring countries. Closer coordination of activities between NPPOsfacilitated by RPPOs would help at a regional level. EPPO, as the oldest RPPO, provides a good model for less experienced RPPOs. Rather than follow rigid European regulations (MacLeod 2007 ), the UK and some other EU Member States have traditionally supported a more independent attitude to planthealth (Baker and Pemberton 1993 ). However, there is no denying that European interests have a major influence on UK plant health work (Bartlett 1994 ,2000 ). As a ‘weakest- link’public good (the plant health status of the EU as a whole can only be as good as that of the weakest Member State) it is imperative that Europe continues its long historyof collaboration and major involvement in developing plant health internationally by being increasingly active on a global scale. However, in future, Europe ’s international influence may decline as the influence from non-European countries such as Brazil, Russia, India, China and parts of Africa increases.It is clear that when moving plants and plant products internationally no supply system can ever be totally secure. Plant health and food security is about managing the pestrisks associated with such movements. Identifying, assess- ing, managing and mitigating risk has, in recent years, become a much more conscious exercise in the public andprivate sectors (Defra 2006 ) and regulatory scientists have made efforts to explain their role and reach out to a wider research community (e.g. Magarey et al. 2009 ; Rodoni 2009 ). If this can facilitate collaborative research to better identify and predict pathways of entry, pest impacts and appropriate risk management measures, then progress willhave been made. In the 21st Century plant health is not only about ensuring food security but also concerns protecting growersor the environment from burdens on their well-being. In the UK and elsewhere, following the outbreak of Foot and Mouth Disease in 2001, politicians have a greater aware-ness of the significance of multi-functional agriculture, which not only provides food commodities but also manages the countryside, preserving wildlife for the benefitof the wider public. Increasingly, the need to involve stakeholders in the decision making process is regarded as essential (Lawton 2007 ). Drawing upon a wider knowledge base, by assessing risks in a more interdisciplinary fashion and including stakeholders from an early stage, regulationsand actions should become more sustainable (Anon. 2005 ).

Ghoneim1*, Samar I. Gadallah1, Lobna A. Said1, Ahmed M. Eltawil2,3,  Ahmed G. Radwan4,5 & Ahmed H. Madian1,6 Bio-impedance non-invasive measurement techniques usage is rapidly increasing in the agriculture  industry. These measured impedance variations reflect tacit biochemical and biophysical changes  of living and non-living tissues. Bio-impedance circuit modeling is an effective solution used in  biology and medicine to fit the measured impedance. This paper proposes two new fractional-order  bio-impedance plant stem models. These new models are compared with three commonly used  bio-impedance fractional-order circuit models in plant modeling (Cole, Double Cole, and Fractional- order Double-shell). The two proposed models represent the characterization of the biological  cellular morphology of the plant stem. Experiments are conducted on two samples of three different  medical plant species from the family Lamiaceae, and each sample is measured at two inter-electrode  spacing distances. Bio-impedance measurements are done using an electrochemical station (SP150)  in the range of 100 Hz to 100 kHz. All employed models are compared by fitting the measured data  to verify the efficiency of the proposed models in modeling the plant stem tissue. The proposed  models give the best results in all inter-electrode spacing distances. Four different metaheuristic  optimization algorithms are used in the fitting process to extract all models parameter and find the  best optimization algorithm in the bio-impedance problems. Natural products derived from plants, animals, and minerals have been the primary method for treating human  diseases. Throughout history, medical plants have become in high demand for their efficiency in treating and  preventing  diseases1. Important compounds could be derived from their leaves, stems, roots, fruits or used as a  whole plant. Nowadays, medical plant extracts became essential in most chemical medicines and commercial   products2. The global market for botanical and plant-derived drugs, according to a study by BCC Research  (Business Communications Company as a leading market information resource), will grow from 29.4 billion$  in 2017 to around 39.6 billion$ by 2022 with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.1% for the period of  2017–20223, where medical plants represent 10% of Vascular plants with around of 350,000 species. According to the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group classification (APG) in 2016, 25 of 416 families of flowering  plants are crucial for human needs in  medicine4, where they hold specific herbal properties such as anti-oxidant,  anti-bacterial and anti-nociceptive effects. One of the most prominent families belongs to the flowering plants is  Lamiaceae . It is very distinctive and known for its useful constituents in pharmacological and therapeutic treat- ments and its contribution to different biological  activities5. It consists of around 7000 species with 250 genera  that are diverse and spreads widely in different ecosystems. Species that belong to the Lamiaceae family contain secondary metabolites with antimicrobial, antiviral, anti- cancer, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties where it is mainly studied as a natural antioxidant source.  They are well known for their biochemical extracts and essential oil that is found in leaves, stem, and  flower5.  Most aromatic existent family species have proved efficient results in treating gastrointestinal tract disorders and  diseases that affect the cardiovascular system and upper respiratory tract, such as “ Arterial HyperTension(AHT)”6.  The critical compounds derived from this family include tannins, polyphenols, flavonoids, alkaloids, and OPEN 1Nanoelectronics Integrated Systems Center (NISC), Nile University, Giza, Egypt. 2Electrical Engineering and  Computer Science Department, University of California-Irvine, Irvine, USA. 3King Abdullah Univ. of Science  and Technology, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia. 4Engineering Mathematics and Physics Department, Cairo University,  Giza, Egypt. 5School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Nile University, Giza, Egypt. 6Radiation Engineering  Department, Egyptian Atomic Energy Authority NCRRT  , Cairo, Egypt. *email: mohamed_ghoneim@ieee.org2 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports  |         (2022) 12:3992  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-06737-z www.nature.com/scientificreports/terpenoids, which contributes significantly to the importance of the Lamiaceae family in Health  treatment5. The  flavonoids have proved to be associated with lower coronary heart disease  mortality7. Terpenes are responsible for  antitumor, antibacterial, cardiotonic and anti-inflammatory effects. Tannin helps prevent or treat atherosclerosis,  and alkaloids are beneficial in treating cardiovascular and central nervous systems  diseases8. Origanum majorana , Salvia officinalis  L. and Lavandula  are common species included in the Lamiaceae   family. They are medical aromatic herbs that grow and are commonly used in Egypt and well known in North  Africa, the Mediterranean and Western  Asia9–11. Besides being used in commercial products and food industry,  they proved to be beneficial in traditional medicine due to their antimicrobial, antiviral, anti-inflammatory,  antifungal and antioxidant  properties12. Origanum majorana , known as Marjoram, is used as a whole plant, ground or even as a source for essential  oils. The addition of Marjoram to vegetables during storage provides protection against Oxidation, Light damage,  pigment degradation and spoilage  fungus9. Marjoram has proved efficient healing role of some diseases, such  as treating obesity due to  hyperlipidaemia13. Ethanol extraction from Marjoram’s stem is used in the prevention  of cancer and carcinogenesis mutations. Its oil may improve asthmatic patients’ health condition and is used in  enhancing liver and kidney  activities14. In general, it is deployed as a safe traditional medicine that is used in  curing coughs, indigestion, rheumatism, toothache and heart  conditions9. Salvia is the largest genus in the Lamiaceae family known as Common Sage (Salvia officinalis  L.)5. Extracts of  this plant were found to reduce the growth of different kinds of cancers and reduce  mutations12. Its antioxidant  properties have a vital role in reducing the development of cardiovascular and neurological diseases. Some of its  extracts have anti-inflammatory, antibacterial and anti-malarial effects that could be deployed in clinical drugs  to dispose of the undesired side  effects10. Lavandula  is a common genus in the Lamiaceae, known for its strong fragrance and the usage of lavender oil  for various health conditions such as stress, fatigue, and it is also common in  aromatherapy15. It was deployed  in medicine for kidney and stomach issues, and provided satisfying results for the central nervous system. Also,  from its benefits in the medical field are mean blood pressure reduction, Pulmonary (related to Lung) sickness  therapy, and Neuro-psychiatric11. The plants’ conditions under different environments are monitored through non-destructive and destructive  measurements. Monitoring plants helps in reducing damage, preventing diseases and increasing plant yield. Bio- impedance is the produced electrical impedance from the excitation of the biological cell through an AC signal  (voltage or current)  stimulus16. Tissue impedance changes depend on extra- and intra-cellular resistance, health  status, structure, morphology, type, location, chemical composition, and  shape17. When the tissue is excited with  an AC voltage signal, at low frequencies, the current paths through the extracellular fluid around the cells, while  at higher frequencies, the current flows everywhere (through the cells), and that leads to lowering the impedance  due to the capacitive nature of the  cells17,18. According to these different responses, it is vital to use a wide range  of frequencies to measure bio-impedance. Bio-impedance measurements are used in the diagnosis of plants behaviour to certain conditions such as fruit   maturity19,20, fruit  ripening21,22, analyzing the effect of heating and freezing conditions on  fruits23, measuring of  root  growth24, and determining the water content and characteristic analysis of the root  zone25. Also, it is used  to provide information about environmental change effect on  fruits26.  In27, the tissue damage of a bruised apple  sample was determined by using electrical impedance. There are other contributions in using bio-impedance  measurements for different applications such as blood glucose  measurement28, monitoring insulin availability  for personalized diabetes  therapy29, Characterising red blood cell micro-circulatory  parameters30, and tactile  sensing bio-hybrid soft E-skin in soft  robotics31. The heating and freezing of the plant tissue and their effect  on the bio-impedance models’ parameters are discussed  in23, where the impedance drops as the temperature  increases. Impedance increased in the samples that suffered from freezing conditions, indicating cellular dam - age due to ice generation. Different bio-impedance circuit models were proposed to represent the electrical characteristics of the bio - logical cell of  plants17. In 1940, it was the first representation for the biological tissue by introducing the single  dispersion Cole-impedance  model32. It became the most popular and commonly used models due to its sim- plicity and fitting  accuracy33. In 1969, the Hayden model was introduced to provide representation for cell   components34, but showed some faults in fitting due to the missing of vacuole  representation35. In 1990, the  double-shell model was introduced to overcome the defects of the Hayden model by adding the representation  of vacuole in the proposed  model16,18. However, the double-shell model showed many defects in fitting at low   frequencies35. Then the second generation of single dispersion Cole-impedance model, which is the double  dispersion Cole-impedance model, was presented to improve the representation accuracy of impedance over  broadband  frequencies36.  In35, the Hayden, simplified Hayden and double-shell models were reintroduced into  the fractional-order form to add more flexibility in the fitting process and overcome the integer defects. Hayden  model was used in the characterization of various plants such as carrot roots and cabbage leaves  in16. Plant  shoots and Stem were modeled for the Soybean plant using general models that do not clearly describe the stem   functions37. To the author’s knowledge, there was no previous attempt to model or characterize medical plants  in general, including the Lamiaceae  family. Fractional calculus (FC) is the study that governs the operation of integrals and derivatives of non-integer  order, where traditional calculus is a small subset of it. Fractional order modeling most notable benefits are the  memory dependency in the fractional derivative definition, and adding more degree of freedom that increases  the controllability and flexibility of the system through the extra parameter from the derivative  order38,39.  Recently, fractional calculus become the pioneer in many fields such as control  systems40,  filters39,41,  robotics42,   encryption43, chaotic  systems44, bio-engineering45,46, and super-capacitor  modeling47. Recently, metaheuristic optimization algorithms, which are inspired by natural phenomena, showed a suc - cessful employment for the bio-impedance parameter extraction  problems48,49. Metaheuristics are used to mimic 3 Vol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports  |         (2022) 12:3992  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-06737-z www.nature.com/scientificreports/the intelligence-gathering behavior of water  cycle50, pollination process in the  plant49, chicken behavior in the   swarm51, red fox searching for food, hunting and escaping from  hunters52, black widow spider  mirage53, Harris  Hawks during chasing of the  prey54, elephants herd and the distance between  them55, hunting process of the  grey  wolf56, and many others. They are used to overcome the defecates and difficulties that face the traditional  optimization  methods49.  In33, flower pollination algorithm (FPA) and moth flame optimization (MFO) were  used to extract the Cole-impedance model parameters and compared with the traditional nonlinear least square  (NLS). FPA and MFO showed their superiority over the NLS method in fitting the measured data and accuracy  of the extracted parameters. Also, the FPA achieved the best accuracy and consistency over the other employed  optimization (NLS,MFO), while the NLS technique was the fastest.  In49, six different metaheuristic optimiza - tions were used to extract the Cole-impedance model parameters using two different datasets magnitude only  impedance measurements and complex impedance measurements. It was found that Cuckoo search optimization  (CS) and FPA algorithms had a better fitting for the experimental datasets, less error and higher consistency than  the other used algorithms. FPA, CS, and MFO algorithms were used  in45 to extract the Cole-impedance model  parameters using an alternative way to measure the bio-impedance (differentiator circuit). It was concluded that  CS and FPA algorithms had a quite similar performance, where CS converges faster, and FPA takes less run time.  FPA showed a reasonable parameter extraction over CS and MFO. Optimization algorithms are recognized as a soft computing method used to solve complex problems. Soft   computing is concerned with approximate models and controlling complex systems, as it is tolerant to impreci- sion, uncertainty and approximations. Soft computing is a combination of optimization algorithms, in addition to  artificial neural networks and machine learning algorithms that are used for decision-making57,  identification58,  and predictions  support59. In this paper, two new Fractional-order electrical impedance models are proposed for plant stem repre- sentation. The stem impedance is measured using SP150 for two samples of three medical plants (Marjoram,  Salvia officinalis  L., Lavandula ) from Lamiaceae  plant family. The measured impedance data are fitted on three  commonly used bio-impedance models with plants (Cole, double Cole and Fractional-Order double-shell), and  compared with the two proposed models. Then the models’ parameters are extracted using four metaheuristic  optimization algorithms [FPA, CS, WCA and Chicken swarm optimization (CSO)]. The Nyquist plot is plotted  for the measured and the fitted data for all models. The error between the measured and fitted data is calculated  to find the best model and the best optimization algorithm. This paper is organized as follows: Section “ Stem modeling ” briefly describes the plant stem anatomy and  the role of each stem layer, it also shows the impedance model circuit’s analysis and their representation. Sec- tion “ Problem definition ” illustrates the problem formulation. Section “ Experimental results and discussion ”  provides the experimental results and discussion. Finally, Section “ Conclusion ” concludes the paper. Stem modeling Stem tissue structure. Plant Stem plays a vital role in the growth and protection of the plant, providing  support to the plant weight. It bears the flowers and leaves of the plant and acts as a transportation channel for  water, nutrients and food through all the plant parts. The green stems participate in the Plant’s Photosynthesis   process60. Monitoring the plant stem helps to investigate the plant’s condition, such as transpiration rate (water  flow) and nutrient concentration. It could also act as an indication to the soil  state37. For medical plants, some  beneficial compounds are extracted from the plant stem, such as ethanol that has antioxidant and anti-gout  activity; it also contributes to the production of some essential  oils61. The stem (see Fig.  1) includes multiple lay- ers that depend on the structure of the plant and its growing conditions. It mainly consists of Vascular, ground  and Epidermis  systems60. The Vascular system is composed of Xylem and Phloem as Complex cells. The Xylem  is responsible for transferring water and nutrients from the roots along the whole stem and into the leaves. It  is a one-directional tube that consists of smaller tubes connected through a gate. The Phloem is a bidirectional  transportation system that transports food and organic materials from the green parts to the rest of the plant.  The Phloem and Xylem are grouped in vertical strands called vascular bundles and are separated by a layer of  cells named  cambium37,60. The epidermis in Fig.  1 is the outer layer that covers the stem with a rigid structure and waxy appearance in  some plant species. It protects the stem against injury, infection and water  loss60. It also acts as a controller of the  gas, water and nutrients exchange with the surrounding environment. The epidermis evolved various features,  such as some specific cell types and guard cells, to adjust to its various functions. The cell’s shapes and functions  are developed according to their growing  circumstances62. The Plant ground parts are responsible for the stem support, where it consists of the Pith and the cortex that  is located between the vascular bundle and the epidermis. The tissue cells of the cortex may include essential  oils, tannins and stored carbohydrates. The Pith is at the centre of the stem with a soft spongy structure. It con - tributes to the storage of nutrients and minerals. For some plants, the stem could harden and then decomposes  to produce a hollow shaped  stem60. Electrical modeling. General bio‑impedance models. The biological cell cannot be dealt with as a homo- geneous medium, consisting of various complex  elements35. When current migrates through a cell, it is attenu- ated by existent water electrolytes, and intracellular and extracellular components. The Cole-impedance model  shown in Fig.  2a proved to produce a good fit to experimental impedance data when applied to different tissues.  It was initially proposed as a general model. Then it was applied more specifically to describe plant status. The  Cole-impedance model is represented as follows:4 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports  |         (2022) 12:3992  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-06737-z www.nature.com/scientificreports/where Ro represents the resistance at low frequency, R∞ represents the high-frequency resistance and α represents  the Constant phase element(CPE) order. The Cole-impedance model is used to fit the measured data of various  types of tissues such as shoots and leaves tissues  in63. It was also used to study the effect of freezing–thawing on eggplant, maturity measurements of fruits and   vegetables64.  In65, the ripening of fruits was investigated using various models.  In17, the Cole-impedance model  was used to study the photosynthetic activity in plants during illumination and darkness. Although this model  gave good results for most of the experimented tissues, it did not provide an explanation for the operating  mechanism in the cell. To provide a better representation for cell components in complex materials, the Cole-impedance model was  expanded as shown in Fig.  2b into double Dispersion Cole impedance model where its impedance representa - tion is as follows: The double dispersion Cole impedance model was used as a representation of the plant stem  in37. It was used  to fit measurement data of various fruits and vegetables such as banana, cucumber and oranges  in35, where dif- ferent models were compared, and the double Cole impedance model provided the best results. The double Cole  impedance model could be used as an indicator of frost hardening in shots of Scots  pine64. To accurately describe the plant tissue cell’s components, the Double-shell model was developed to provide  a representation of the cell Vacuole. The fractional-order Double-shell model shown in Fig.  2c was firstly intro- duced  in35 and its impedance is described as follows: where R1 represents the extracellular resistance, R2 represents the intracellular resistance, R3 and Cβ represent  the Vacuole resistance and capacitance respectively, and Cα represents the plasma membrane capacitance. The  double-shell model is used in studying different plant condition such as ripening, heating and Freezing, but  proved to be most efficient in plants  ripening17. It was also used as a representation for the plant stem  structure37. Proposed bio‑impedance models.  The proposed electrical impedance model in Fig.  2d characterizes the plant  stem. The Epidermis (see Fig.  3) is a hard protective layer; in most cases, it consists of a single layer of cells rep- resented by an electrical resistor Ro . The Xylem, Phloem, and the Cambium (Bundle) are each represented by a  resistor and capacitor in series as they have a tube-like structure. Also, the Cortex has the exact representation.

The selected plants were purchased from the market and cultivated by  an outsource company (Safwa For Agriculture) and supervised by the support services office at Nile University  that complies with institutional, national, and international guidelines and legislation. The three plants are  identified as Origanum majorana , Salvia officinalis  L., and Lavandula . Two sample plants of each species are  employed in the experiment. Electrochemical workstation, commonly used in impedance analyzing, (SP150)  is used to measure the impedance of the plants at room temperature of 25 °C for a frequency range from 10 Hz  to 100 kHz. Electrodes are placed along the plant stem with a distance of 5 cm and 10 cm apart from each other  noninvasively for each sample, as shown in Fig.  4, to verify the effect of electrodes separation on the observed  results. The two experiments are consecutively done on each sample to prevent any changes in the impedance.  The applied sinusoidal voltage excitation is Vrms=20mV  with no DC offset. The number of the measured points  is 80 points per decade. Then the log is imported to MATLAB to run post-processing. Post-processing is conducted on the measured impedance data using four metaheuristic optimization algo - rithms to extract the parameters of the employed models. The applied algorithms are adopted according to the  literature, where they proved to output satisfying results. It is essential to precisely define the factors influencing  the optimization algorithm’s result to obtain optimal bio-impedance models’ parameters. The factors include  the objective function, number of search agents, runs and iteration, the upper and lower boundaries, and the  vector of optimized variables.  1. The objective function represented in Eq. (6 ) is the sum of the absolute error between the estimated imped- ance from the model and the measured impedance of the sample for each frequency point.   where x is the impedance parameters of each model depending on the problem size, Zmodel (x) is the imped- ance equation of the models, while Zmeasured  is the measured response of the sample. n  is the total number  of the measured points. 2. The number of search agents used in the optimization is 60 and runs for 100 independent runs through 1800  iterations for all the tested samples. 3. The search agents search for the best solution in a region defined between a lower (LB) and an upper (UB)  boundary defined differently for each model are shown in Table  1. 4. (a) For Cole-impedance model, the impedance parameters are [  α , R∞ , Ro , Cα]. (b) the Double dispersion Cole impedance model parameters are [  α , β , R∞ , R1 , R2 , Cα , Cβ]. (c) The impedance parameters for Fractional-Order Double-shell model are [  α , β , R1 , R2 , R3 , Cα , Cβ] (d) The proposed Stem model parameters are [  α , β,γ,ζ,/afii9838 , Ro , R1 , R2,R3 , R4 , Cα , Cβ,Cγ,Cζ,C/afii9838]. (e) The impedance parameters for the proposed simplified Stem model are [  α , β,γ , Ro , R1 , R2 , Cα , Cβ,Cγ]. Experimental results and discussion In this section, The two proposed stem models are validated by fitting the measured data and using FPA, CS,  CSO, and WCA optimization techniques in the models’ parameters extraction process. As mentioned in the  literature, FPA and CS optimization algorithms are used before in bio-impedance parameter extraction prob- lems and showed good performance, while WCA and CSO are used for the first time for such problems. The  four algorithms are compared to select the most fitted algorithm in such a problem by studying the error and  convergence curves.

The extracted models’ parameters by WCA are shown in Table  2. For Marjoram plant samples, the Nyquist plot is plotted for the experimental data and the extracted param - eters from the four applied optimization techniques (FPA, CS, CSO, and WCA), as shown in Table  3. The pro - posed stem model and the simplified model have shown good fitting results. Furthermore, the error between the  measured impedance of marjoram by (SP150) and the fitted data is calculated for each model, where the FPA, CS,  CSO, and WCA algorithms are applied for each model. WCA algorithm showed the best result compared to FPA,  CS, and CSO optimizations in all studied cases. For the Marjoram plant samples at 5 cm distance, the maximum  error calculated for Cole-impedance model is around 2%, for Double Cole is 2%, for Double-shell is 0.8%, for  the proposed stem model is less than 0.5%, and for the proposed simplified stem model is less than 0.8%. For  the case of Marjoram with a distance of 10 cm, the Cole-impedance model has a maximum error greater than  5%, for the Double Cole model is 0.8%, for the Double-shell is greater than 2.5%, while for the proposed model  is 0.5%, and for the simplified one is less than 0.4%. For Salvia plant samples, the Nyquist plot is plotted for the experimental data, and the extracted parameters  from the four applied optimization techniques, as shown in Table  4. The proposed stem model and the simplified  model have shown good fitting results. Furthermore, the error between the measured impedance of marjoram by  (SP150) and the fitted data is calculated for each model, where the four optimization algorithms are applied for  each model. WCA algorithm showed the best result compared to FPA, CS, and CSO optimizations in all studied  cases. For samples at a 5 cm distance, the maximum error for the Cole model is around 5%, for the Double Cole  model is around 1.6%, for the Double-shell model is 1.2%, while for the proposed stem model and the simplified  one are less than 0.7%. While for the 10 cm distance, the maximum error for the Cole model is less than 2.5%,  for the Double Cole model is equal to 1.3%, for the Double-shell model equals 1.1%, for the proposed model is  around 1%, and for the proposed simplified model is around 1.1%. For Lavandula  plant samples, the Nyquist plot is plotted for the experimental data, and the extracted param- eters from the four applied optimization techniques as shown in Table  5. The proposed stem model and the  simplified model have shown good fitting results. Furthermore, the error between the measured impedance of  marjoram by (SP150) and the fitted data is calculated for each model, where the four optimization algorithms are  applied for each model. WCA algorithm showed the best result compared to FPA, CS, and CSO optimizations  in all studied cases. for samples at 5 cm distance, the maximum error for Cole model is greater than 5.5%, for  Double Cole and Double-shell models is 4%, for the proposed stem model is around 1.5%, and for the simplified  stem model is around 2%. While for the 10 cm distance, the maximum error for the Cole model is greater than  6%, for the Double Cole model and Double-shell model is 2.5%, for the proposed stem model is around 1%, and  for the proposed simplified stem model is around 1.8%. For more exploration for the performance of the four used optimization algorithms, Convergence curves are  investigated at 1800 iteration. Table  6 shows the convergence curves for a sample of Marjoram at 5 cm distance.  In all models, WCA optimization converges at 1000 iteration, while CSO optimization shows an inconsistency  behaviour. For CS optimization, it converges at 600 iteration for Cole and Double-shell impedance models, and  converges at 1500 iteration for the Double Cole and the proposed stem models, while it needs more than 1800  iteration to converge in the proposed simplified stem model. For FPA optimization, Cole impedance model  needs 1000 iteration to converge, and around 1700 iteration for Double-shell and the proposed stem model.  While Double Cole impedance model converges at 1800 iteration, and the proposed simplified stem model needs  more than 1800 iteration to converge. According to this results, WCA optimization outperforms the other three  optimizations as it got the lowest error percentage in all cases. FPA and CS optimizations show defects when  dealing with a bigger problem size; also, CSO showed an inconsistency behaviour in some cases. The final outcome is that the proposed stem and the simplified stem models showed a remarkable performance  over the commonly used models in plant stem tissues representations. Furthermore, WCA is the recommended  technique for bio-impedance problems, especially for the larger problem size. Conclusion Two fractional-order bio-impedance models for plant stem characterization were introduced and compared  with three known models (Cole, Double Cole, Fractional-Order Double-shell). Their parameters were extracted  based on the measured data of three medical plant species using two samples each. The employed optimization  algorithms are WCA and CSO optimizations, which are used for the first time in such problem, and compared  with two conventional metaheuristic optimization techniques (FPA and CS) used before in similar problems.  Error percentage was plotted versus frequency for each model using the four algorithms to test the models’ effi- ciency and the most efficient algorithm for the studied problem. The proposed models showed their significant  advantage over the other used models in all electrode positions tested; they give the least fitting error percentage  compared with the actual measurements’ data. The WCA optimization algorithm demonstrates its accuracy, par - ticularly for a larger problem size where the FPA optimization algorithm shows some defects. Other metaheuristic  optimization techniques were tested, such as Moth Flame Optimization (MFO), Black Widow Optimization  Algorithm (BWOA), Whale Optimization Algorithm(WOA), Slime Mould algorithm (SMA), etc.. However,  they did not match the WCA. For possible future work, more recent optimization algorithms can be employed  in similar problems such as Polar Bear Optimization Algorithm (PBO)66, Red Fox Optimization (RFO)52, and  Elephant Herding Optimization (EHO)67.10 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports  |         (2022) 12:3992  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-06737-z www.nature.com/scientificreports/Table 2.

"Plant stem-cell organization and differentiation at single-cell resolution James W. Satterleea, Josh Strablea, and Michael J. Scanlona,1 aSchool of Integrative Plant Science, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853 Edited by Dominique C. Bergmann, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, and approved November 5, 2020 (received for review September 6, 2020) Plants maintain populations of pluripotent stem cells in shoot apical meristems (SAMs), which continuously produce new above-ground organs. We used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) toachieve an unbiased characterization of the transcriptional land- scape of the maize shoot stem-cell niche and its differentiating cellular descendants. Stem cells housed in the SAM tip are en-gaged in genome integrity maintenance and exhibit a low rateof cell division, consistent with their contributions to germline and somatic cell fates. Surprisingly, we find no evidence for a ca- nonical stem-cell organizing center subtending these cells. In ad-dition, trajectory inference was used to trace the gene expression changes that accompany cell differentiation, revealing that ectopic expression of KNOTTED1 (KN1) accelerates cell differentiation and promotes development of the sheathing maize leaf base. Thesesingle-cell transcriptomic analyses of the shoot apex yield insight into the processes of stem-cell function and cell-fate acquisition in the maize seedling and provide a valuable scaffold on which tobetter dissect the genetic control of plant shoot morphogenesis atthe cellular level. shoot apical meristem |maize |single-cell transcriptomics |cell differentiation Unlike animals where organogenesis is typically completed in juvenile stages, plants initiate new organs throughout the lifespan via the persistence of pluripotent stem-cell populations long after embryogenesis. In the plant shoot, these stem cells are housed within the shoot apical meristem (SAM), which gives rise to all of the aboveground organs of the plant (1). Canonical descriptions of SAM organization in flowering plants include a stem-cell niche within the central zone at the SAM tip, sub-tended by the stem-cell organizing center, and a peripheral zone surrounding the SAM flank that provides initial cells for or- ganogenesis. The genetic maintenance and organization of the stem-cell niche, and how cells attain differentiated fates remain fundamental areas of interest in plant development. Class I KNOTTED-LIKE HOMEOBOX (KNOX ) genes broadly promote indeterminate cell identity in vascular plants, that is, a state in which cell proliferation and growth can continue indefinitely (2). This is in contrast to determinate cell identity, in which cell proliferation and growth cease in order to produce a tissue or organ with a predetermined size. KNOX down-regulation is a marker of cell differentiation and comprises an initial step inlateral organ identity acquisition at the SAM periphery. In Ara- bidopsis , stem-cell homeostasis is achieved via a negative feedback loop wherein the activity of the stem-cell-organizing transcription factor WUSCHEL (WUS) is repressed by binding of the small secreted peptide CLAVATA3 (CLV3) to the CLAVATA1 (CLV1) receptor (3). The canonical CLV –WUS signaling pathway and other receptor –ligand signaling complexes regulating WUS- mediated control of shoot meristem size are identified across the flowering plants (3). In order to better understand the spatial organization of the maize SAM and the process of cell differentiation during plant development, we took a single-cell transcriptomic approach toachieve an unbiased sampling of cell types from the maize ( Zea mays spp. mays ) SAM and seedling shoot apex unimpeded byprior histological assumptions. Improved protocols for the iso- lation of living plant stem cells enabled this single-cell tran- scriptomic analysis of a plant vegetative shoot meristem. Twozones of cell identity are identified within the maize SAM: 1) aslowly dividing stem-cell domain at the SAM tip expressing genes with functions in genome integrity, and 2) a subtending pop- ulation of cells undergoing transit-amplifying divisions. Althoughthe CLV –WUS stem-cell homeostatic pathway is well described in a diverse array of angiosperm SAMs and in the inflorescenceand floral meristems of maize (3), we find no evidence for a stem-cell organizing center expressing WUS in the maize SAM (4). Trajectory inference was used to identify dynamic gene ex-pression patterns correlated with cell differentiation and ulti-mate cell fate in the seedling shoot. We find that ectopicexpression of KNOTTED1 (KN1) in differentiating leaf primor- dia drives cellular transcriptomes to more differentiated states, which we ascribe to a role for KN1 in promoting sheath cell fate in leaves alongside its role in maintaining shoot indeterminacy inthe SAM and stem. Taken together, this study reveals the landscape of cell states and the dynamics of cell-fate acquisition in the developing maize seedling shoot apex, as a first steptoward further analyses of maize development at single-cellresolution. Results Single-Cell Transcriptomic Approach for the Analysis of Maize Vegetative SAM Cells. Single-cell transcriptomic analyses of plant cells require the preparation of protoplasts, viable cellswhose rigid, cellulosic cell walls are enzymatically removed. Significance Plants possess the remarkable ability to grow and produce new organs throughout their lifespan, owing to the activities of persistent populations of pluripotent stem cells within their meristematic tips. Here we isolated individual cells from themicroscopic shoot apical meristem (SAM) of maize and providesingle-cell transcriptomic analysis of a plant shoot meristem. This study enabled an unbiased analysis of the developmental genetic organization of the maize shoot apex and uncoveredevolutionarily divergent and conserved signatures of SAMhomeostasis. The fine-scale resolution of single-cell analysis was used to reconstruct the process of shoot cell differentia- tion, whereby stem cells acquire diverse and distinct cell fatesover developmental time in wild-type and mutant maizeseedlings.

Previously, limitations in the recovery of viable protoplasts from SAM-enriched plant tissues have presented an obstacle to single- cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analyses of shoot meristems (5). To achieve a higher rate of viable cell recovery, we supple-mented the protoplasting solutions with L-arginine ( L-Arg), which modestly enhanced cell viability ( SI Appendix ,F i g .S 1 A). This finding was consistent with previous reports of enhanced cell vi-ability of oat ( Avena sativa ) coleoptile protoplasts cultured in media supplemented with L-Arg (6). Increasing the pH of the media further enhanced protoplast viability ( SI Appendix , Fig. S1B), in keeping with prior studies showing that the in vivo pH of SAM tissue in the herbaceous plant Chenopodium rubrum is two orders of magnitude more alkaline than typical plant protoplasting solutions (7). Together, these modifications to our protoplastingprotocol improved cell viability between 10- and 30-fold, depending on the tissue. To capture cells from the microscopic seedling SAM, we manually harvested protoplasts from dissected apices comprising the SAM plus the two most recently initiated leaf primordia(SAM + P2). After filtering, six biological replicates captured a total of 327 cells for scRNA-seq analyses (median transcripts detected =8,955, median genes detected =2,221) (Fig. 1 Aand SI Appendix , Fig. S2 ). We first used k-means clustering to classify transcriptionally similar cells. Next, we performed dimensionality reduction using uniform manifold approximation and projection(UMAP), which plotted the seven resulting clusters in two- dimensional space. Owing to the abundance of cycling cells in the SAM + P2 tissues (49% in S/G2/M phase), we regressed outvariation contributed by the cell cycle on cell clustering ( DatasetS1). We assigned cell-type identities to clusters based on their expression of known shoot apex marker genes ( Dataset S2 ) and identified clusters corresponding to major cell types derived from the epidermis, primordia, and vasculature, along with indeter- minate cell types from the SAM (Fig. 1 BandSI Appendix , Fig. S3). Intriguingly, instead of forming discrete, isolated cell clus- ters, the majority of SAM-enriched cells exhibited a continuumof intermediate identity states (Fig. 1 B), suggesting that differ- entiation is highly dynamic and continuous in the maize SAM and young leaf primordia. Control of Genomic Integrity Among Maize Stem Cells. We first sought to identify signatures of the stem-cell population of themaize SAM. The tip of the maize SAM is thought to house thestem cells (4, 8), which are essential for generating the above- ground somatic tissue of the maize plant as well as cells that give rise to the germline. Cell clustering analysis independentlyidentified a transcriptionally distinct cell population in whichDYNAMIN (DYN ), a previously identified marker of tip cells in the maize SAM, was up-regulated within a broader population of meristematic cells expressing KN1 (Fig. 1 C–E) (4). We therefore designated cells belonging to this cluster as the putative stemcells residing within the SAM tip and used differential expression(DE) analysis to identify 89 genes preferentially expressed within this population (Fig. 1 FandDataset S2 ) (4). Among these were genes with confirmed or predicted roles in intercellular signaling,small RNA biogenesis, DNA maintenance, response to the planthormones auxin and cytokinin, and transcriptional regulation(Fig. 1 F).

For example, the stem-cell-enriched SUPRESSOR OF GENE SILENCING3-LIKE (SGS3-LIKE ),RNA POLYMERASE IV/V SUBUNIT2 , and ARGONAUTE4a (AGO4a ) all encode mem- bers of the RNA-directed DNA methylation pathway that maintains heterochromatin at repetitive, retrotransposon-enriched, maize genomic regions (9). Indeed, maintenance of heterochromatin is likewise essential for the genomic stability and homeostasis of stem-cell populations in animals (10).However, unlike animals where germline cells are specified andsequestered during early embryonic stages, plants lack a segre- gated germ cell lineage during vegetative stages of development (11). Up-regulation of genes involved in DNA repair-relatedprocesses, such as a PROTECTION OF TELOMERES1-LIKE (POT1-LIKE) and a DNA-DAMAGE BINDING2-LIKE gene likely reflect the advantage of maintaining high genomic fidelityamong cells that have the potential for both somatic and germ cell fate (12). Collectively, these data suggest that cells in the maize SAM tip are engaged in genome protective functionsconsistent with their plant stem-cell identity. Rates of Cell Division Are Kept Low in the SAM Stem-Cell Population. Increased rates of cell division increase the chances for sponta- neous mutations during genome replication. We therefore asked if stem cells in the maize SAM tip exhibit differences in celldivision rate. Estimates of cell-cycle stage generated during cell-cycle regression ( Materials and Methods ) indicated that the fraction of SAM + P2 cells in G1 phase decreased as differen- tiation progressed, indicative of higher rates of cell division(Fig. 2 A). For example, the SAM tip population contains a larger fraction of cells in G1 phase than the remainder of the meristem, leaf primordia, or vasculature cell populations, suggesting alower cell division rate among the stem cells. In order to test this, we performed RNA in situ hybridization on HISTONE H3 and CYCLIN1 transcripts that accumulate in cells at S phase and G2/ M phase, respectively. We next subdivided medial SAM sectionsinto five bins of equal height along the proximodistal axis and inferred the spatial distribution of cell division stages by image thresholding on HISTONE H3 andCYCLIN1 staining (Fig. 2 B– E). Cells in bin 1 that comprises the tipmost region of the SAM consistently had the lowest number of dividing cells. When con- sidered together with our detection of transcripts encoding factorsthat promote genomic and epigenomic stability in the SAM tip(Fig. 1 F), a low cell division rate among the stem-cell population can explain how plants avoid unfavorable increases in genetic load over successive generations in the absence of a segregated germ-line early in ontogeny. A reduced rate of cell division at the SAM tip is likewise consistent with the low number of cell divisions that are predicted to occur between formation of the maize zygote andthe gametophytes contributing to the next generation (13). Cells in the remainder of the SAM, below the tip, showed higher rates of cell division, similar to transit-amplifying cell divisions found inanimal stem-cell niches (14). These proliferative cell divisions intransit-amplifying cells generate the anlagen for determinate lat- eral organs, obviating the requirement for high rates of stem-cell divisions. Finally, we observed that in axillary meristems (AMs),the highest concentration of dividing cells typically occurs closer to the AM tip as compared to the SAM (Fig. 2 D), suggesting that cell division patterns are dynamically regulated in differentshoot meristem types, possibly due to relative differences in meristem activity. Divergence in SAM Stem-Cell Regulation. We next sought to analyze the cell-specific expression patterns of regulators of stem-cell maintenance within the SAM + P2 tissues. FON2-LIKE CLE PROTEIN1 (FCP1 ) was the only CLV3- like ligand-encodingtranscript detected in meristem tip cells (Fig. 3 A). RNA in situ hybridization identified weak expression of FCP1 just below the SAM tip, as well as the originally reported expression in theSAM periphery and leaf primordia (15). The FCP1 peptide – ligand is perceived by the FEA3 receptor to repress stem-cell identity (15). FEA3 transcripts show low and diffuse accumula- tion in the SAM periphery and heightened expression in leaf primordia (Fig. 3 B). Other maize transcripts encoding predicted leucine-rich repeat (LRR) receptors exhibited similar accumu-lation patterns ( Dataset S4 ), with higher expression in the SAM periphery and primordia but a lack of a strong SAM-specific expression profile as is seen for CLV1 inArabidopsis (16). This could reflect a role for LRR receptors in inhibiting stem-cellidentity outside of the SAM tip domain, as described previ- ously for the FCP1 –FEA3 ligand –receptor system (15).

InArabidopsis , the stem-cell promoting transcription factor WUS is negatively regulated by CLV1 –CLV3 function, to con- trol the size of the meristematic stem-cell pool (3). WUS is mobile and is expressed in the organizing center (OC) below the stem-cell domain from where it is trafficked to promote stem-cell fate in the SAM tip. A similar, stem-cell organizing ZmWUS function is described in the maize inflorescence meristem (3). However, we did not detect ZmWUS -expressing cells in the SAM, although transcripts of several maize WUS homologs,including ZmWOX3a ,ZmWOX9b , and ZmWOX9c were identi- fied (Fig. 3 C). The single Arabidopsis WOX9 homolog promotes cell proliferation in meristematic tissues upstream of WUS function, but belongs to a more ancient, functionally divergent WOX clade that lacks the repressive WUS box (17, 18). Overall, this suggests that the maize coorthologs WOX9b andWOX9c are unlikely to be functionally homologous to WUS . Moreover, al- though WOX3A does encode a WUS box and is detected in the SAM (Fig. 3 C), its expression pattern is not cell-type specific, inconsistent with a well-defined OC. Thus, our data identify no candidate WOX gene expressed in the maize B73 SAM that is FG DRM1 GRAS33 +/+ +/+ gras32 gras33D 050100150 C< CDC<CEFGH9;<CDEFGHLength (μm)Width Height 050100 +/+ +/+ gras32/ + gras33gras32 gras33Length (μm)Width Height *H IJKUNK in situ hybridization pattern * * LFCP1 FEA3 WOX9cTip Meristem 1 Meristem 2 Primordia Epidermis 1 Epidermis 2 VasculatureExpression levelHigh LowFEA2FEA3 TD1 CRNFCP1 CLE10- LIKECLE25- LIKE WOX9CWOX9BWOX3AWOX13A WOX13BTip Meristem 1 Meristem 2 Primordia Epidermis 1 Epidermis 2 Vasculature Tip Meristem 1 Meristem 2 Primordia Epidermis 1 Epidermis 2 VasculatureB UNK Expression-Log10(Adjusted p-value)    Log(Fold-change)C A ESAMEarLeafgDNA Water ZmWUS1 ZmWUS2 GAPDHKN1 PLA1UMAP-1UMAP-2LowHigh Fig. 3.

Indeed, past bulk RNA-seq analyses of the SAM have failed to identify transcripts from the two paralogous maizeWUS genes, ZmWUS1 andZmWUS2 (4, 19). To extend these findings, we performed RT-PCR analyses in an attempt to detect the accumulation of ZmWUS1 andZmWUS2 transcripts. While both transcripts were detectable in immature ears containinginflorescence meristems, we did not detect their expression in vegetative shoot apical tissue comprising the SAM and the three most recently initiated leaf primordia (Fig. 3 D). Together, these results suggest that the canonical CLV1 –CLV3 –WUS pathway has been bypassed in the maize B73 SAM, with changes in the spatial expression patterns of corresponding maize paralogs as a defining feature. WUS -Independent Functions for Maize HAM-LIKE Genes in the SAM Core. To further investigate the organization of the maize SAM, we examined gene expression patterns among cells derived from a recently reported domain situated in the center, or “core ”re- gion of the SAM, which is marked by the expression ofGRMZM2G049151 , a gene of unknown function ( UNKNOWN [UNK ]) (4). We identified cells within the core region by tran- script accumulation of GRMZM2G049151 and used DE analysis to characterize their expression profiles (Fig. 3 Eand Fand Dataset S5 ) (4). SAM core cells show up-regulated expression of thePLASTOCHRON1 (PLA1 ) gene. PLA1 promotes cell divi- sion and growth in an auxin-dependent manner and is alsoexpressed within multiple maize organs and tissues (20). Indeed, our analyses of cell division dynamics in the SAM indicated that the core region had higher cell proliferation activity relative tothe SAM tip (Fig. 2). The auxin-promoted dormancy-associated gene DRM1 (21) and the maize HAIRY MERISTEM3 (HAM3 ) homolog GRAS33 were also up-regulated in the SAM core, as confirmed by RNA in situ hybridizations (Fig. 3 F–HandSI Appendix , Fig. S4 Band C).Arabidopsis HAM genes are expressed in the organizing center, SAM periphery, and in leafprimordia. AtHAM genes promote SAM maintenance through their physical interaction with WUS and also activate the for- mation and maintenance of AMs that give rise to lateral branches (22, 23). To determine if GRAS33 activity in the core domain has a conserved role in maintenance of the maize SAM, we generated double mutants between GRAS33 and its paralog GRAS32 and analyzed SAM size in seedlings ( SI Appendix , Fig. S4A). Compared to the wild-type (WT) siblings, gras32 /+gras33 seedlings and gras32 gras33 double mutants displayed shorter SAMs (Fig. 3 I–K). Only gras32 gras33 SAMs possessed shorter AMs, likely owing to genetic redundancy between these factorsin AMs (Fig. 3 L). These data suggest that maize GRAS32 and GRAS33 , like their Arabidopsis homologs, have roles in regu- lating SAM homeostasis from a stem-cell surrounding regionthat overlaps the maize SAM core domain. These results further suggest that unlike in Arabidopsis , the maize SAM tip is not subtended by a WUS -expressing, stem-cell organizing center. Rather, this SAM core region displays signatures of auxin-regulated growth processes, as suggested by the up-regulated expression of PLA1 and DRM1 . Thus, the maize SAM core may be functionally akin to the tip-subtending SAM regionsexpressing HAM genes in Arabidopsis , with maize HAM genes having a potential WUS-independent SAM regulatory function. Cell Differentiation Follows a Continuum of Transcriptional States. Given that the individual transcriptomes of cells within the maize shoot apex fit a continuum of cell differentiation states (Fig. 1 B), we aimed to determine the dynamic changes in gene expression that accompany this developmental progression. We applied a principal graph algorithm to identify a branching path among theembedded cellular coordinates in the UMAP projection, whichwe used to infer the differentiation trajectory of cells in the SAM + P2 dataset. Each cell was then assigned a pseudotime value based on its distance along the resulting path, relative to a specified pseudotime start position within the SAM tip cellpopulation (Fig. 4 A). As expected, we found that pseudotime progression is associated with the transition of cells from inde- terminate to determinate cell fates; KN1 a key marker of inde- terminate meristematic identity is highly expressed early inpseudotime and declines as pseudotime progresses (Fig. 4 A) (24). To survey the transcriptional changes associated with cell differentiation, we performed DE analysis to identify transcript accumulation patterns that significantly correlate with pseudo-time progression. In total, over 2,000 genes exhibited significant changes in expression over pseudotime ( Dataset S6 ). Hierar- chical clustering grouped each transcript according to expressionpattern and identified several patterns of transcript accumula-tion that correspond to particular stages of cell differentiation (Fig. 4 B). Early in pseudotime, genes enriched for stem-cell functions in RNA metabolism and chromatin organization give way to genesenriched for glutathione transferase and cation-binding activities as well as expression of DRM1 andGRAS33 , which are expressed among cells in the SAM core. Next, cells progress through aputative boundary domain identity, marked by up-regulation ofanARABIDOPSIS THALIANA HOMEOBOX GENE1-LIKE (ATH1-LIKE ) gene, LIGULELESS3 (LG3), and GA2OX1 . ATH1 promotes organ boundary formation in Arabidopsis and antagonizes activity of the growth phytohormone gibberellic acid (GA) alongside GA2OX1 -promoted GA catabolism (25, 26). In addition, LG3 is expressed in specific boundaries during leaf development (27). After progressing to this putative shootboundary domain, the cellular transcriptomes of SAM + P2 cells resolve into either epidermal or ground and vascular cell iden- tities. The lack of a transcriptionally distinct lineage of undif-ferentiated epidermal cells (protoderm) early in the trajectory isnotable, given that the cell lineage of the outer protodermal layer is separate from that of underlying cells, even within the SAM tip (1). Together, this suggests that despite their celllineage differences, the distinctive transcriptional profiles amongcell types in the SAM tip become detectable only after exiting the boundary regions of the SAM. Indeed, transcript accumulation of epidermal marker genes such as LTP1 ,LTP3 , and OCL4 has been shown to first occur in the protodermal layer in the SAMperiphery, outside the SAM tip (4, 19). Increased sampling of the maize SAM may be necessary to uncover the more subtle ex- pression differences that distinguish tip protodermal cells fromunderlying cell populations. As expected, we found that epidermal cell differentiation correlates with up-regulation of the OUTER CELL LAYER(OCL) homeodomain leucine zipper IV transcription factor-encoding genes that promote epidermal cell identity (28). On the other hand, cells fated to become leaf primordia and/or vasculature exhibit up-regulation of auxin response genes andtranscripts associated with cell wall, chloroplast, organ develop-ment, and cell proliferation. In addition, primordia and vascular cells are significantly enriched for transcripts related to transla- tion, suggesting a large burst in protein synthesis accompaniesleaf initiation and expansion. Selected genes significantly asso-ciated with pseudotime progression were examined by RNA in situ hybridization to validate their expression patterns along the developmental trajectory (Fig. 4 C–F). A gene expressed early in the pseudotime trajectory, ZINC FINGER DOMAIN- LIKE (ZNF-LIKE ), showed expression in the SAM tip (Fig. 4 C). Meanwhile, FLOWERING PROMOTING FACTOR1-LIKE (FPF1-LIKE ) and WALLS ARE THIN1-LIKE (WAT1-LIKE ) transcripts are up-regulated later in pseudotime and accumulate in differentiating vasculature and leaf margin cells (Fig. 4 Dand E). Lastly, HYBRID PROLINE-RICH PROTEIN1 (HYP1 ) Satterlee et al. PNAS |December 29, 2020 |vol. 117 |no. 52 |33693 PLANT BIOLOGY Downloaded from https://www.pnas.org by 14.139.226.226 on February 9, 2024 from IP address 14.139.226.226. transcripts are also up-regulated later in the pseudotime, albeit detected at later stages of ontogeny (Fig. 4 F). Together, these results support the notion that the transcriptomes of differenti- ating cells are highly dynamic across a continuum defined by pseudotime progression. Genes Patterning Indeterminate and Determinate Cell Fates Are Expressed Across Leaf Ontogeny. After leaf initiation at the SAM periphery, cells continue to proliferate in the leaf proximal re-gion well beyond the P6 stage (i.e., the sixth leaf from the SAM), necessitating continued maintenance of indeterminate and de- terminate zones at the junction of the leaf and stem across on-togeny (29). To analyze this later patterning and differentiationprocess we prepared tissues comprising ∼3 mm of the maize shoot apex from 2-wk-old seedlings, dissected to include the six most recently initiated leaf primordia plus the SAM (SAM + P6; SI Appendix , Fig. S5 A) for scRNA-seq analysis. In total, we captured the transcriptomes of 12,967 protoplasts (in two bio-logical replicates) using microfluidic droplet capture (mediantranscripts detected =14,992, median genes detected =4,965). We performed dimensionality reduction and found cell clusters corresponding to epidermal, vascular, leaf primordial, indeter-minate, and cell cycle states, which were remarkably similar tothe cell types we detected at earlier stages of ontogeny in the SAM + P2 dataset ( SI Appendix , Figs. S5 Band S6 –S8and Datasets S7 –S9). However, cells within our SAM + P6 dataset are overwhelmingly derived from later stages of shoot ontogeny(i.e., P4 to P6), owing to the markedly increased size of theseolder leaf primordia and associated stems. For example,although we identified indeterminate cells based on their ex- pression of the transcription factor gene KN1 (SI Appendix , Fig. S7C), we did not identify cells with transcriptomic signatures of the seedling SAM stem-cell niche in our SAM + P6 dataset(Fig. 1 C–F). Nonetheless, we identified many of the signatures of the indeterminate-to-determinate cell-fate transition ( SI Ap- pendix , Fig. S9 ). We hypothesized that the transcriptomic signatures of cell differentiation would be similar at both early and late stages ofleaf development, reflecting the iterative and modular patterning of the plant shoot system. To test this, we again used trajectory inference to assign cells a pseudotime value reflective of theirposition in the indeterminate-to-determinate transition and uti- lized DE analysis to identify genes with pseudotime-correlated expression patterns (Fig. 4 G). Overall, we identified ∼3,000 genes that met a stringent significance cutoff (adjusted [adj.]P<1E-100) and compared them to pseudotime-correlated genes in the SAM + P2 dataset. We found that approximately one-third of the transcripts showed a significant correlation with pseudotimein both datasets (hypergeometric test, P<1E-100), suggesting a core module of genes controls the indeterminate-to-determinate cell transition across ontogeny, which includes KN1 (Fig. 4 Hand Dataset S10 ). We used RNA in situ hybridization to validate these patterns and confirmed shared genes significantly associated with cell differentiation in both the SAM + P2 and SAM + P6 datasets(SI Appendix ,F i g .S 1 0 ). In addition, expression curves for identical genes in both datasets have a lower median Fréchet distance than nonidentical genes, indicating similar expression behavior acrossontogeny (Fig. 4 I).

Ectopically Expressed KN1 Accelerates Leaf Cell Differentiation by Promoting Sheath Cell Fate. Our single-cell transcriptomic analy- ses consistently distinguished between indeterminate cell types expressing KN1 and determinate cell types with low KN1 expres- sion. Given the role of KN1 in promoting indeterminacy (2, 30), we sought to determine the effects of ectopic KN1 expression on cell-fate progression. The maize leaf comprises a distal, photo- synthetic leaf blade and a proximal sheath that inserts into the leafnode and surrounds the stem. A hinge-like auricle and a fringe of epidermally derived tissue called the ligule develop at the boundary demarcating the blade and sheath. This proximodistalpatterning begins in young leaf primordia (31). Dominant,gain-of-function mutations in KN1 confer its misexpression in developing leaf primordia, (reviewed in ref. 32), resulting in the formation of ectopic sheath identity in the midst of blade tissue(24, 31, 33). In support of this model, we found the Kn1-O /+ seedlings had significantly increased sheath length compared to their WT siblings (Fig. 5 A). At the boundary between sheath andblade, LIGULELESS1 (LG1) gene function is required for for- mation of the ligule and auricle (27, 34). In Kn1-O /+ plants, ec- topic knots of sheath tissue occur in the blade, coupled withadjacent ligule formation at this ectopic blade –sheath boundary (Fig. 5 BandSI Appendix ,F i g .S 1 1 ). InKn1-O lg1 double mutants, however, no ligules are formed at these ectopic blade –sheath boundaries, providing further evidence that the knots in KnO-1 /+ mutant leaf blades comprise patches of misplaced sheath-likeidentity (Fig. 5 BandSI Appendix ,F i g .S 1 1 ). To examine the effects of ectopic KN1 expression on pseu- dotime progression in the maize seedling shoot, we isolatedprotoplasts from normal WT and Kn1-O /+ sibling SAM + P6 tissue and subjected them to scRNA-seq, capturing a total of2,761 cells spanning an indeterminate-to-determinate cell iden- tity transition (median transcripts detected =7,235, median genes detected =3,427 ( SI Appendix , Fig. S12 ). While KN1 and its direct target GA2OX1 were primarily expressed only in in- determinate cells in WT, both genes were more broadlyexpressed in determinate cell types in the Kn1-O /+ background (KN1 adj.P<1E-8, GA2OX1 adj.P<0.01, Fig. 5 C). Trajectory reconstruction revealed a shift in cell-fate progression in Kn1- O/+ relative to WT cell populations (Fig. 5 Dand E).

PNAS |December 29, 2020 |vol. 117 |no. 52 |33695 PLANT BIOLOGY Downloaded from https://www.pnas.org by 14.139.226.226 on February 9, 2024 from IP address 14.139.226.226. (Fig. 5 F, Wilcoxon rank sum test, P=0.003), suggesting that KN1 activity in the leaf promotes rather than delays cell differentiation. To evaluate the gene expression signatures associated with ectopicKN1 activity, we compared the differentially expressed genes in cells ectopically expressing GA2OX1 from the Kn1-O /+ back- ground to determinate cells from the WT background. By tar- geting cells ectopically expressing the KN1 direct-target gene GA2OX1 , we increased the likelihood of analyzing cells in which ectopic KN1 is actively modulating gene expression. As expected, ectopic expression of GA2OX1 is associated with increased KN1 expression (Fig. 5 G). However, we also detected up-regulated expression of key determinacy-promoting genes such as DROOPING LEAF1 (DRL1 )a n d YABBY15 (YAB15 ), suggesting that these cells have retained or partially enhanced determinacy (35). Alongside these genes we observed up-regulated expression of several genes encoding putative cell-wall-modifying enzymes as well as five genes belonging to the LIGHT SENSITIVE HYPO- COTYL (LSH)f a m i l y( Dataset S11 ). Intriguingly, RNA in situ hybridization revealed that transcripts of one of the up-regulated LSH-LIKE genes ( GRMZM2G816289 ) accumulates at leaf pri- mordia bases, in a domain that overlaps that of the developing sheath ( SI Appendix ,F i g .S 1 0 H). Taken together, these results reveal that when misexpressed in leaves, KN1 promotes sheath cell differentiation and accelerates the ontogenetic progression of leafdevelopment as reflected by changes in cell transcriptomes over pseudotime (Fig. 5 H). Discussion Here we present a single-cell transcriptomic survey of a plant vegetative shoot apex including the stem cells housed within the SAM. This technique provides the key advantage of uncovering cell types in an unbiased fashion, without strict reliance on his-tological or genetic markers. Critically, we identify known and novel markers of the putative SAM stem-cell niche and show that it is characterized by increased expression of DNA meth- ylation and DNA repair-related genes, as well as a low cell di- vision rate. This observation supports the notion that only a subset of cells at the SAM tip has the specialized properties of stem cells and may underlie the ability of plants to maintain highintergenerational genetic fidelity despite the absence of embry- onic segregation of the germline as is found in animals (8). In addition, a low cell division rate and the up-regulated expression of genes with genome protective functions within the same cells highlights a convergently evolved solution to maintaining stem cells in postembryonic plant and animal development (11, 36). Questions are raised regarding the lineage contributions of thesestem cells to the developing plant. For example, do cells com- prising the SAM tip make significant contributions to lateral organs or are they preferentially destined to contribute to germ fates as described in the “meristem d ’attente ”(“meristem in waiting ”) model proposed by early histological studies (1)? In the latter view, plant lateral organs are mostly derived from the transit-amplifying cell population that subtends the stem-celldomain, and the SAM tip makes minimal contributions to or- ganogenesis until reproductive stages. Emerging cell lineage tracing methodologies may shed light on these questions (37). Meanwhile, we find a lack of evidence for a WUS -expressing organizing center in the B73 maize inbred vegetative SAM, un- like what is modeled in other angiosperms, suggesting that genes with other, noncanonical, stem-cell organizing functions may beat play. Furthermore, by leveraging the continuum of cells ranging from indeterminate to determinate cell identities, we reconstruct dif- ferentiation trajectories for cells of the seedling vegetative shoot apex, offering unprecedented resolution into shoot cell differen-tiation. Many of the genes that are dynamically expressed along the trajectories at the leaf initiation stage show similaraccumulation patterns at postinitiation stages of leaf ontogeny, demonstrating the iterative process of plant shoot patterning. Surprisingly, we found that perturbing the shoot differentia- tion process via ectopic expression of the homeobox transcrip- tion factor gene KN1 accelerates, rather than delays, cell differentiation in the seedling shoot. This is in contrast to pre- vious models of KN1 action, in which KN1 promotes stem-cell indeterminacy in the SAM, and ectopic KN1 expression in leaf primordia delays or reverses the maturation schedule of maize leaves (38). Indeed, ectopic class I KNOX gene expression has been shown to drive the formation of ectopic meristems in eudicot leaves (2). However, we propose that ectopic KN1 ex- pression accelerates pseudotime progression in the monocot maize leaf by promoting increased and/or premature formation of sheath tissue. Clonal analyses of cell-fate acquisition in thewild-type maize leaf demonstrate that cells fated to adopt blade identity emerge from the SAM first, while cells that will become sheath emerge later in ontogeny (29). Notably, sheath is the last part of the maize leaf to emerge from the SAM and stem and is the last part to elongate. In this way, the young maize leaf pri-mordia within our wild-type SAM + P6 seedling samples are predominantly composed of cells that are fated to form blade. Multiple studies have noted that KN1 transcript and protein accumulate in the extreme proximal bases of maize leaf pri- mordia, starting from the time of leaf inception in the P0, andconcluded that KN1 specifies proximal sheath identity in these leaf bases (24, 39). At the same time, sheath tissue emerges from the SAM/stem much later in ontogeny than blade tissue; indeed, studies of polar auxin transport inhibitors have shown that the most proximal region of the sheath does not emerge from the intercalary meristem of the stem until as late as P4 (40). In- triguingly, transcripts of the maize class I KNOX genes KN1 and RS1 accumulate in the the intercalary meristem of maize (41). Thus, while these proximal sheath cells are more “meristematic ” in the sense of their proximity to and recent emergence from an indeterminate growth zone, acquisition of sheath cell fate occurs late in the developmental ontogeny of the leaf. We thereforepropose a model in which misexpression of KN1 advances leaf ontogeny by promoting ectopic patches of sheath in young leaf primordia that are mostly blade tissue (Fig. 5 H), thereby accel- erating the progression of cell-fate acquisition in the maize leaf. Materials and Methods Plant Materials and Growth Conditions. Plants for scRNA-seq, in situ hybrid- ization, and gras allele phenotyping were grown in 72-well trays in a Percival A100 growth chamber under 16-h days, a day temperature of 29.4 °C, anight temperature of 23.9 °C, and a relative humidity of 50%. Soil consistedof a 1:1 mixture of Turface MVP and LM111. The maize inbred B73 was used for scRNA-seq and in situ hybridization analyses. The gras32 andgras33 al- leles were obtained from the Maize Genetics Co-Op Center (Urbana, IL) inthe W22 inbred background. Crosses were performed at a field site in Au-rora, NY. Kn1-O /+ and WT sibling material along with seedlings and mature plants for ZmWUS1/2 RT-PCR experiments were grown at the Gutermann Greenhouse Facility in Ithaca, NY. Well-introgressed Kn1-O /+ and lg1-R mutants in the B73 genetic background were utilized for genetic interaction analysis. In Situ Hybridization. RNA was isolated by TRIzol (Thermo Fisher Scientific) extraction from liquid nitrogen-ground 2-wk-old maize seedling shoot api-ces. Total RNA was DNase I (Promega) treated and cDNA was prepared usingpolyT-primed SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer ’s instructions. cDNA was then used as a template to amplify probe sequences, which were TA cloned into the pCR4-TOPO vector backbone encoding flanking T3 and T7 polymerase promoters(Thermo Fisher Scientific) (see Dataset S12 for PCR primers). Following the verification of probe sequence and orientation by Sanger sequencing, an-tisense RNA probes were generated using a DIG-labeling kit and theresulting probes hydrolyzed as previously described (Roche Diagnostics) (42). A locked nucleic acid (LNA) probe was used for the WOX9c in situ presented in Fig. 3 Cand was ordered directly from Qiagen. LNA probe hybridization 33696 |www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2018788117 Satterlee et al. Downloaded from https://www.pnas.org by 14.139.226.226 on February 9, 2024 from IP address 14.139.226.226. was carried out using 10 μM probe concentration and a 55 °C hybridization temperature according to published methods (43). Tissues for in situ hybridization were prepared and processed as previously described (42). Briefly, 2-wk-old maize shoot apices were fixed overnight at 4 °C in FAA solution (3.7% formalin, 5% acetic acid, and 50% ethanol in water) and dehydrated through an ethanol series, cleared through in-creasing concentrations of Histo-Clear II (National Diagnostics), and thenembedded in paraplast. Sections of 10 μm were prepared using a Leica RM2235 microtome (Leica Biosystems) and adhered to Probe-on-Plus microscope slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Secti oned tissues were then deparaffinized and rehydrated through a reverse ethanol series prior to Proteinase K (Sigma-Aldrich)treatment, refixation, and acetic anhydr ide treatment. Dehydrated tissues were then hybridized with probe overnight, washed, RNase A (Roche Diganostics) treated, and incubated with AP-conjuga ted anti-DIG antibody (Roche Diagnos- tics). A colorimetric nitro-blue t etrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3 ′-indolyphosphate (Roche Diagnostics) reaction was then a llowed to proceed until sufficient signal developed at which point the reaction was stopped in Tris(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane –ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), slides were dehy- drated, washed in Histo-Clear II, an d mounted with Permount (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Images were obtained using an Axio Imager Z10 (Carl Zeiss Micros- copy) microscope equipped w ith an AxioCam MRc5 camera. RT-PCR of ZmWUS1/2 Expression. Total RNA was isolated (as in in situ hy- bridization) from B73 shoot apices consisting of the SAM and the three mostrecently initiated primordia, immature ∼2-mm ears containing inflorescence meristems, and mature seedling leaf 3 blade tissue. A total of 1 μg of total RNA from each tissue was DNase-I treated and used as input for reverse transcription using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase according to themanufacturer ’s instructions. A total of 1 μL of the 25 μL RT reaction was used for PCR analysis (35 cycles). PCR products were run on a 2% agarose gel and visualized with ethidium bromide under ultraviolet (UV) light. The genomic DNA (gDNA) control was derived from B73 seedling leaf tissue prepared aspreviously described (44). Phenotyping. Forgras allele phenotyping, genomic DNA was extracted from the leaf tissue of F2 seedlings segregating for exonic gras32 and gras33 Mutator transposon insertion alleles. DNA extraction was performed as previously described (44). Plants were genotyped by PCR (see Dataset S12 for primers) and paraffin-embedded FAA-fixed shoot apex tissues (see in situhybridization) were longitudinally sectioned to 10 μm and adhered to Probe-on-Plus slides. Tissues were deparaffinized and rehydrated through an ethanol series and then equilibrated in 1% sodium borate (wt/vol). Tissueswere then stained in a 0.5% solution of o-toluidine (TBO) in 1% sodium borate for 5 min followed by an ethanol dehydration series, washing in Histo-Clear II, and mounting in Permount. Samples were then imaged (see in situ hybridization). SAM width and height were determined in medialsections using ImageJ. For analyses of Kn1-O /+ seedlings, leaf sheath and blade lengths were measured by hand with a meter stick when seedling leaves were fully mature. For Kn1-O/+ and lg1-R genetic interaction analysis, F1BC1 populations were generated, and greenhouse-grown Kn1-O /+;lg1 double mutants were selected based on phenotypic analysis of the blade/sheath boundary, where lg1-R mutants remove ligule and auricle tissues ( SI Appendix , Fig. S10 ). Fully adult leaves were imaged, selecting the leaf above the uppermost ear, with a Canon Rebel digital single-lens reflex camera. Cell-Cycle Quantification. Medial SAM sections probed by in situ hybridization for expression of the S phase and G2/M phase up-regulated H3and CYC1 genes, respectively, were imaged and imported into ImageJ. Images were converted to 16-bit format and processed using the thresholding tool such that stained areas could be differentiated from nonstained areas. For eachSAM, five sections of equal height were measured and the percent ratio ofabove threshold (stained) area relative to the total area of each bin was calculated. Generation and Collection of Protoplasts. Two-week-old maize seedlings were hand dissected to either an ∼3-mm portion of the stem including the six most recently initiated leaf primordia (SAM + P6) or the SAM and the twomost recently intiated leaf primordia (SAM + P2). Dissected tissue was briefly macerated and placed immediately in protoplasting solution, which con- sisted of 0.65 M mannitol, 1.5% Cellulase Onozuka R-10 (Research ProductsInternational [RPI]), 1.5% Cellulase Onozuka RS (RPI), 1.0% Macerozyme R-10 (RPI), 1.0% hemicellulase (Sigma-Aldrich), 10 mM 3-( N-morpholino)pro- panesulfonic acid (MOPS) pH 7.5, 10 mM L-arginine HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM CaCl 2, 5m M β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma-Aldrich). Prior to the addition of CaCl 2,β-mercaptoethanol, and BSA,the solution was heated to 55 °C for 10 min to facilitate enzyme solubili- zation. All tissue collection was completed within 30 to 45 min. Tissue di- gestion was carried out with gentle shaking at 29 °C for 2 h. After digestion, fluorescein diacetate (FDA) was added to the cell suspension at a concen- tration of 5 μg/mL and cells were allowed to incubate in darkness for 5 min. The cell suspension was then filtered using a 40- μm nylon filter and the cells were centrifuged at 250 ×gfor 3 min at 4 °C. Cells were resuspended in washing buffer consisting of 0.65 M mannitol, 10 mM MOPS pH 7.5, and 10 mM L-Arginine pH 7.5 and washed three times using the same centrifu- gation conditions. Cell viability and concentration were assessed using a hemocytometer and a fluorescent Axio Imager Z10 microscope equipped with a 488-nm laser for FDA staining detection. If cell/debris clumping was observed, the suspension was again passed through a 40- μm nylon filter. Cells isolated from SAM + P6 tissue were suspended at a concentration of ∼10,000 cells/mL and loaded onto the 10 ×Genomics Chromium Controller using v3 reagents following the manufacturer ’s instructions to target ∼10,000 cells. Cells from the SAM + P2 tissue were resuspended in 1 mL of wash buffer and a 100- to 200- μL aliquot was transferred to the well of a clear-bottom CoStar plate kept over ice. A total of 200 μL of wash buffer was distributed to other wells on the plate. A Leica M205 FCA microscope equipped with a 488-nm laser was then used to transfer individual viable (FDA+) cells. Each cell was carried in 0.1- μL volumes through three wash buffer wells. Following washing, cells were transferred to a 96-well LoBind (Eppendorf) plate containing reagents for reverse transcription (see library construction and sequencing) and kept on dry ice. Cell collection was com- pleted in <1 h. Plates were sealed with adhesive film and transferred to a−80 °C freezer prior to further processing. Cell Viability Assays. Protoplasts were obtained as described (see generation and collection of protoplasts) with the exception of the pH and concentration of buffer components used. For the pH 5.7 condition, 10 mM 2-( N-mor- pholino)ethanesulfonic acid buffer was used, whereas for the pH 6.5, 7.0, and 7.5 conditions, 10 mM MOPS buffer was used. To quantify cell viability, the ratio of fluorescing (living) protoplasts to dead (nonfluorescing) and large debris ( >5μm) were quantified in each of the four larger corners of a hemocytometer using a fluorescent Axio Imager Z10 microscope equipped with a 488-nm laser. SAM + P2 Single-Cell RNA Isolation and Amplification. Single-cell RNA-seq li- brary construction was performed using an adaptation of the Cel-Seq2 protocol (45). The 96-well LoBind plates were prepared with each well containing 0.22 μL 25 ng/ μL Cel-Seq2 RT primer (1s –96s primers, Dataset S12 ), 0.11 μL 10 mM deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs), and 0.77 μL nuclease- free H 2O such that each well of the plate contained a unique cell barcoded RT primer. After cell collection and storage at −80 °C, plates were thawed briefly on ice and centrifuged at 2,000 ×gfor 2 min at 4 °C. Next, plates were incubated at 65 °C for 5 min and again centrifuged using the same settings. For reverse transcription, 0.54 μL First Strand Buffer, 0.27 μL 0.1 M dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.135 μL RNAseOUT (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 0.034 μL SuperScript III, and 0.52 μL nuclease-free H 2O were added to each well and plates were incubated for 1 h at 42 °C followed by RT inactivation for 10 min at 70 °C. cDNA was pooled horizontally into the eight wells at the end of each plate. Then, 2.5 μL1 0×Exonuclease I buffer and 2.1 μL Exonuclease I were added to each well and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min followed by heat inactivation at 80 °C for 15 min. cDNA was purified using Ampure RNACleanXP beads according to the manufacturer ’s instructions and resuspended in 7μL nuclease-free H 2O. Second strand synthesis was performed by adding 2.31 μL Second Strand buffer, 0.23 μL dNTPs, 0.08 μLEscherichia coli DNA ligase, 0.3 μLE. coli DNA polymerase, and 0.08 μL RNase H and incubated at 16 °C for 2 h. Pooled dsDNA from each of the eight reactions was pooled and then purified using Ampure XP beads according to the manufacturer ’si n - structions followed by resuspension in 6.4 μL nuclease-free H 2O. In vitro transcription was performed by the addition of 1.6 μL each of the A, G, C, U dNTPs, 10 ×T7 polymerase buffer, and T7 polymerase (Ambion) followed by incubation at 37 °C for 13 h. Amplified RNA was then treated with ExoSAP-IT (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 15 min at 37 °C followed by RNA fragmenta- tion by addition of 5.5 μL fragmentation buffer (200 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM MgCl 2) and incubation for 3 min at 94 °C. Fragmentation was stopped by transfer to ice and the immediate addition of 2.75 μL 0.5 M EDTA pH 8.0. Library Construction and Sequencing. For reverse transcription, 5 μLo ft h e amplified RNA was added to 1 μL randomhexRT primer and 0.5 μL dNTPs, incubated at 65 °C for 5 min, and chilled on ice. Next, 2 μL First Strand buffer, 1μL 0.1 M DTT, 0.5 μL RNAseOUT, and 0.5 μL SuperScript III were added and the samples incubated for 10 min at 25 °C followed by a 1-h incubation at Satterlee et al. PNAS |December 29, 2020 |vol. 117 |no. 52 |33697 PLANT BIOLOGY Downloaded from https://www.pnas.org by 14.139.226.226 on February 9, 2024 from IP address 14.139.226.226. 42 °C. Half of the completed RT reaction was subjected to PCR by addition of 5.5μL nuclease-free H 2O, 12.5 μL Phusion High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix with HF buffer (New England Biolabs), RNA PCR Primer1 (RP1), and 1 μL of RNA PCR Primer X (RPIX). PCR conditions were as follows: 30 s at 98 °C, 11 cycles of 10 s at 98 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, 30 s at 72 °C, and 10 min at 72 °C. The pooled cDNA from each plate received a unique RPIX. Samples were then purifiedand size selected via two rounds of AMPure XP bead treatment using a 1:1ratio of beads-to-sample and the final library was resuspended in 10 μL nuclease-free H 2O. A total of 1 μL of the library was submitted for fragment analysis using an Agilent Bioanalyzer to confirm a target library size be- tween 200 and 400 bp. An additional 1 μL was used for concentration measurement using a Qubit. If the library concentration was suboptimal, thesecond unused half of the RT reaction was amplified using up to 15 PCRcycles. Libraries were then sequenced using a single flow cell on an IlluminaNextSeq 500 instrument using the small RNA chemistry. Paired-end se-quencing was performed with 15 and 77 bp obtained for read 1 and read 2,respectively. The libraries generated from the biological replicates of SAM + P6 cells were also sequenced using a NextSeq 500 instrument, with each replicate allocated a single flow cell of sequencing. For experiments usingcells from sibling Kn1-O /+ and WT seedlings, barcoded libraries were pooled together prior to sequencing. Single-Cell RNA-Seq Read Processing and Cell Filtering. SAM + P2 FASTQ files were processed using the default settings in the celseq2 pipeline ( https:// github.com/yanailab/celseq2 ), which includes read trimming, alignment, and unique molecular identifier (UMI) counting steps to generate a UMI count matrix (45). Reads were aligned to version 3 of the B73 reference genome. SAM + P6 reads were trimmed, aligned, and UMI count matrices generatedusing the CellRanger version 3.1.0 pipeline under the default settings. Readswere aligned to version 3 of the B73 reference genome. The UMI countmatrices for individual biological replicates were merged prior to furtheranalysis. For the SAM + P2 dataset, cells with fewer than 500 genes detected were removed while in the SAM + P6 dataset; cells with fewer than 2,500 genes detected were removed. In both datasets, cells with over 1% oftranscripts encoded by the mitochondrial genome were removed. Dimensionality Reduction, Cell-Type Classification, and Differential Expression Analysis. Cell-type analysis and clustering were performed using Seurat v3.0 (46). The merged UMI count matrices were converted to Seurat objects.Normalization and variance stabilization were performed using SCTrans-form and the 3,000 genes with the highest expression variability were used for the calculation of principal components. UMAP was then used to embed cells in lower dimensional space for data visualization. For projection of SAM+ P2 cells, UMAP was run using dimensions (dim) =1:5, number of neighbors (n.neighbors) =15, minimum distance (min.dist) =0.1, and spread =5. For the projection of SAM + P6 cells, UMAP was run using dim =1:25, n.neighbors =25, min.dist =0.01, and spread =1. For the SAM + P6 subset cells, cells belonging to clusters 5 and 0 were reclustered in isolation using the same parameters as for the full dataset. Cells were assigned to clusters using k-means hierarchical clustering. All differential expression analyses used to compare gene expression on a per-cluster basis were performedusing Wilcoxon ranked-sum tests using the Seurat FindMarkers function. GOenrichment analysis was done using a Fisher ’s exact test implemented in AgriGO v2 (47). Cell-cycle regression was used to reduce the effects of the cell cycle on cell clustering in the SAM + P2 dataset. Differentially expressedgenes among cells belonging to cell clusters with S-phase and G2/M-phase marker gene expression were first identified (adjusted Pvalue <0.05). Genes that were highly specific for these clusters were identified using a ratio of the number of cells expressing a given differentially expressed gene withinthe cluster to those in all clusters. Those with a ratio greater than 2 were deemed phase specific and their expression was used to calculate a numeric cell-cycle score and a cell-cycle stage (G1, S, and G2/M) implemented inSeurat (46). SCTransform was run again on the raw UMI count matrix with cell-cycle score as a variable to regress, followed by principal component analysis and UMAP dimensionality reduction. Trajectory Inference and Pseudotime Analysis. Trajectory inference and pseudotime analysis was performed using Monocle3 ( https://cole-trapnell- lab.github.io/monocle3 ) (48). A principal graph was generated using the learn graph function and cells were assigned a pseudotime value usingorder_cells with a pseudotime start or “root ”position manually selected. Genes that were differentially expressed along the inferred trajectories were identified using the graph_test function, which applies a Moran ’sItest to detect spatial autocorrelation. For the SAM + P2 dataset, individual Moran ’s Itests were performed on cell subsets to better identify genes with branch- specific expression patterns. This involved two tests on a common pop-ulation of cells derived from the tip, meristem 1, and meristem 2 clustersmerged with cells from the Primordia and Vasculature clusters or the epi- dermis 1 and 2 clusters. The significantly differentially expressed genes along both trajectories were then further analyzed. For the visualization andanalysis of pseudotime-dependent gene expression patterns, cubic smoothing splines were fit to each gene using the R smooth.spline function with a spar parameter of 1.1. To compare the expression behavior of genesin the SAM + P2 and SAM + P6 datasets, smoothed expression profiles for each gene were averaged in 10 pseudotime bins and z-scaled values for each bin were calculated. The Fréchet distances between the curves of identicalgenes and all nonidentical genes were calculated using the Similar- ityMeasures R package (49). Phylogenetic Analysis. For the phylogenetic analysis of GRAS proteins, amino acid sequences of all Arabidopsis GRAS proteins and HAM-LIKE homologs in rice ( Oryza sativa ) and maize were downloaded from Phytozome. Amino acid sequences were then aligned using Clustal Omega. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree construction was performed using PhyML. The Jones – Taylor –Thornton (JTT) amino acid substitution model was selected based on its Akaike information criterion (AIC) calculated using smart model selection (SMS) implemented in PhyML (50). Branch support values were calculatedusing the aLRT SH-LIKE fast likelihood-based method (51). Data Availability.
