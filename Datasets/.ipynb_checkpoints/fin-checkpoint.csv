Financial Statements of the General Department    PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, 655 New York Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20001   T: (202) 414 1000, www.pwc.com/us       Report of Independent Auditors     To the  Board of Governors of the International Monetary Fund     Opinion     We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the General Department of the International  Monetary Fund (the “Department”), which comprise the  statements of financial position as of April 30,  2022 and 2021, and the related statements of income, of comprehensive income, of changes in reserves,  retained earnings, and resources, and of cash flows for the years then ended , including the related notes  (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”).     In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial  position of the Department as of April 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash  flows for the years then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued  by the International Accounting Standards Board.     Basis for Opinion     We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of  America (US GAAS) and in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our  responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibil ities for the Audit  of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of the International  Monetary Fund, and have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant  ethical requirements relatin g to our audit,  which include relevant ethical requirements in the United  States of America and the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for  Professional Accountants . We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and  appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.     Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial  Statements     Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the fina ncial statements in  accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting  Standards Board, and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the  preparation and fair presenta tion of financial statements that are free from material misstatement,  whether due to fraud or error.     In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Department’s ability to  continue as a going concern for at least, but not limited to, twelve months from the end of the reporting  period , disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of  accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Department or to cease operati ons, or has  no realistic alternative but to do so.           Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Department’s financial reporting  process.     Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements       Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are  free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that  includes our opinion . Reasonable assurance is a high l evel of assurance but is not absolute assurance and  therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with US GAAS and ISAs  will always  detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement result ing  from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional  omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material  if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment  made by a reasonable user based on the financial statements.     In performing an audit in accordance with US GAAS and ISAs we:    ● Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.   ● Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to  fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such  procedures include exam ining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in  the financial statements.   ● Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit  procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for  the purpose of expressing an  opinion on the effectiveness of the Department’s internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is  expressed.    ● Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant  accounting estimate s made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the  financial statements.   ● Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate,  that raise substantial doubt about the Department’s ability to c ontinue as a going concern for a  reasonable period of time.     We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the  planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal contr ol-related  matters that we identified during the audit.    Supplemental Information     Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the financial statements taken as a  whole. The accompanying supplemental schedules appearing on pages 40 to 48 as of April 30, 2022 and  for the years ended April 30, 2022 and 2021 (collectively referred to as the “supplemental schedules”) are  presented for purposes of additional analysis and are not a required part of the financial statements. The  supplemental s chedules are the responsibility of management and were derived from and relate directly to  the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the financial statements. The information  has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the au dit of the financial statements and certain  additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying  accounting and other records used to prepare the financial statements or to the financial statements     themselv es and other additional procedures, in accordance with US GAAS.

Nature of operations  The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is an international  organization with 190 member countries. The IMF’s  fundamental mission is to en sure the stability of the  international monetary system. It does so in three ways:  surveillance of the global economy and the economies of  member countries; lending to  countries with balance of  payments difficulties; and giving practical help by providing technical assistance to members. It is headquartered in Washington, DC, USA.   The IMF conducts its operations and transactions through the  General Department. The General Department comprises three accounts: (i) the General  Resources Account (GRA);  (ii) the Investment Account (IA); and (iii) the Special Disbursement Account (SDA).  1.1  General Resources Account  The financial operations of the IMF with its members are  primarily conducted through the GRA. The assets and liabilities in the GRA reflect the payment of member quota  subscriptions, use and repayment of GRA credit, borrowings  and repayments to lenders, collection of charges from borrowers, payment of remuneration on creditor positions  and interest to lenders, and other operations.  A core responsibility of the IMF is to provide financial  assistance to member countries experiencing actual or  potential balance of payments pr oblems. Upon the request of  a member country, GRA resources are made available either  under a financing arrangement or in the form of outright  purchases (disbursements). An arrangement is a decision by  the IMF’s Executive Board (Executive Board) that gives a  member the assurance that the IMF stands ready to provide  resources to the member during a specified period and up to a specified amount, in accordance with the terms of the  relevant financing instrument.   The Stand-By Arrangement (SBA)  is designed for members  with balance of payments problems expected to be resolved  in the short to medium term. The Extended Fund Facility  (EFF) is a special facility in the GRA for members with longer-term balance of payments problems, the resolution of  which would require structural and more comprehensive  economic reforms. Resources under the SBA and the EFF are made available in phased installments as the member  implements economic policies and measures specified under the arrangement, subject to periodic reviews by the  Executive Board.  The Flexible Credit Line (FCL) is available for members with  very strong fundamentals, policies, and track records of  policy implementation and is intended for both crisis prevention and resolution. The Short-term Liquidity Line  (SLL) is designed to provide liquidity support and has several  innovative features, including revolving access. It has the  same qualification criteria as the FCL but is available only for  members facing potential moderate short-term balance of  payments needs arising due to capital account pressures.  The Precautionary and Liquidity Line (PLL) is available for  members with sound economic fundamentals but with some remaining vulnerabilities that pr eclude them from meeting the  qualification criteria for the FCL and the SLL.   The financing instrument for outright purchases is the Rapid  Financing Instrument (RFI), which is used by members facing  an urgent balance of payments need without the necessity or  capacity for a full-fledged program.  1.2  Investment Account  The IA holds resources transferred from the GRA, which are  invested to broaden the IMF’s income base. The Rules and Regulations of the IA adopted  by the Executive Board  provide the framework for the implementation of the expanded investment authorit y authorized under the Fifth  Amendment of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, which  became effective in February 2011. The IA comprises two  subaccounts: the Fixed-Income Subaccount and the Endowment Subaccount.   The Fixed-Income Subaccount holds resources transferred  from the GRA that are not relat ed to profits from gold sales.  With a view to generating income while protecting the IMF’s  balance sheet, the investment objective of the Fixed-Income  Subaccount is to produce returns in Special Drawing Rights  (SDRs) terms in excess of the th ree-month SDR interest rate  (see Notes 2.1 and 2.2) over time while minimizing the  frequency and extent of negative returns and  underperformance over an investment horizon of three to  four years. During financial year ended April 30, 2022, the  Executive Board concluded its 5- yearly review of the Fixed- Income Subaccount’s investment strategy and effective January 12, 2022, set the investment objective to achieve, over time, returns that exceed  the SDR interest rate by a  margin of 50 basis points. I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021    12 The Endowment Subaccount was credited with  SDR 4.4 billion in profits fr om gold sales during financial  years 2010 and 2011. The Endowment Subaccount’s investment objective is to achieve a real return of 3 percent in US dollar terms over the long term to contribute to covering  the IMF’s administrative expenditures, while preserving the  long-term real value of these assets.   1.3  Special Disbursement Account  The SDA is the vehicle used to receive profits from the sale of gold held by the IMF at  the time of the Second  Amendment of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement (April 1978).  SDA resources can be used for various purposes, as  specified in the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, including transfers to the GRA for immediate use in operations and  transactions, transfers to the IA, or operations and  transactions that are not authorize d by other provisions of the  IMF’s Articles of Agreement but are consis tent with the  mandate of the IMF, in particular to provide balance of payments assistance on special terms to low-income  member countries.  1.4  Other entities administered by the IMF  The IMF also administers the Special Drawing Rights  Department (SDR Department ), trusts (Concessional  Lending and Debt Relief Trusts), and special purpose accounts (Administered Accounts) established to fund financial and technical services consistent with the IMF’s  purposes. As the General Department does not have control  over these entities, their finan cial statements are presented  separately.  The resources of the SDR Department are held separately  from the assets of all t he other accounts owned or  administered by the IMF. As specified in the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, these resources may not be used to meet the liabilities, obligations, or losses incurred in the operations of  the General Department (or vice versa), except that  expenses of conducting the business of the SDR Department are paid by the General De partment and are then reimbursed  by the SDR Department.   The resources of the trusts and special purpose accounts are  contributed by members, by other  financial institutions, or by  the IMF through the SDA. The a ssets and liabilities of the  trusts and special purpose accounts are separate from the assets and liabilities of the General Department. The assets  of the trusts and special purpose accounts cannot be used to  meet the liabilities, obligations, or losses incurred in the  operations of the General  Department. The General  Department can be reimbursed for the expenses incurred in  conducting the business of certain trusts and accounts in  accordance with the IMF’s Articles of Agreement and  relevant decisions of the Executive Board. 1.5  Impact of geopolitical and global economic  developments  The COVID-19 pandemic has cr eated severe disruptions in  global economic activity. The IMF responded to the crisis  with unprecedented speed and  magnitude of financial  assistance, to help countries, notably to protect the most vulnerable and set the stage for economic recovery. A significant number of countri es benefited from emergency  financing through RFI purchases during the financial year ended April 30, 2021 (see Note 5.1). The IMF has also approved financial assistance under its lending arrangements  and augmented existing lending arrangements to  accommodate new needs arising from the impact of the pandemic during the financial years ended April 30, 2022,  and 2021 (see Schedule 3). As a result of this increased  financing activity, the General Department’s credit exposure has increased compared with the pre-pandemic level.  The evolution of the pandemic is  still subject to significant  uncertainty. Beyond April 30, 2022, slowing global growth  and elevated debt vulnerabilities could lead to further  demand for lending arrangements in the coming months. The war in Ukraine that started in February 2022 is expected to  have a significant negative effect on global growth through  commodity markets, trade, and, to a lesser extent, financial interlinkages. Economic and financial spillovers from the war  could also trigger additional demand for Fund financing.   The General Department continues to manage its risks in  accordance with its existing risk management framework  (see Note 4). As of the date of  these financial statements,  there had been no negative impact on the operational results of the General Department, in cluding from the impairment  analysis of its credit portfolio (see Note 5.1). See also Note  2.3 for the most significant estimates and judgements used in  the preparation of thes e financial statements.  The risk management practices described in Note 4.3 have  effectively mitigated the risk exposure of the effects of the  global developments on the investment portfolios. The  valuations of mark-to-market  financial instruments had fully  and rapidly recovered after a brief decline in value at the  onset of the pandemic. However,  in light of the war in  Ukraine, tightening monetary c onditions coupled with a sharp  increase in inflation and inflat ion expectations, the investment  portfolios remain subject to challenging market conditions  and high volatility. The effects of the global developments on  investments are also reflected in the value at risk (VaR) (see  Note 4.3.2.3). The valuation of  investments held at amortized  cost was not impacted. I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021     13 2.  Basis of preparation and measurement  The financial statements of t he General Department are  prepared in accordance with International Financial  Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International  Accounting Standards B oard (IASB). The financial  statements have been prepared under the historical cost  convention, except for the revalu ation of financial instruments  at fair value through profit or  loss. The financial statements  have also been prepared on t he basis that the General  Department will continue to op erate as a going concern.  2.1  Unit of account  The financial statements are presented in SDRs, which is the  IMF’s unit of account. The value of the SDR is determined  daily by the IMF by summing specific amounts of the basket  currencies in US dollar equivalents on the basis of market exchange rates. The IMF generally reviews the composition  of the SDR valuation basket at  five-year intervals. These  reviews cover the currencies to be included in the SDR valuation basket (along with the criteria for the selection of  currencies), determine the relative weights of those  currencies, and assess the fi nancial instruments that are  used to calculate the SDR interest rate. The current basket consists of five currencies. The weights and amounts of the  currencies in the basket, at April 30, 2022, and April 30,  2021, relative to 1 SDR, were as follows:  SDR basket curren cy Weight (in percent) Amount  Chinese renminbi 10.92 1.0174  Euro 30.93 0.38671  Japanese yen 8.33 11.900  Pound sterling 8.09 0.085946  US dollar  41.73 0.58252    At April 30, 2022, SDR 1 was equal to US$1.34430  (US$1.43599 at April 30, 2021).  The current SDR valuation basket was originally scheduled  to expire on September 30, 2021. However, the Executive  Board decided to extend it to July 31, 2022.  On May 11, 2022, the Exec utive Board concluded the  quinquennial review of the me thod of valuation of the SDR  and agreed to maintain the curr ent composition of the SDR  currency and interest rate baskets and approved their  updated weights. The updated basket implies slightly higher weights for the US dollar and the Chinese renminbi and,  accordingly, somewhat lower we ights for the British pound,  the euro, and the Japanese yen.   Effective August 1, 2022, t he SDR basket valuation basket  will be assigned the following weights:  SDR basket currency Weight (in percent)  Chinese renminbi 12.28  Euro 29.31  Japanese yen 7.59  Pound sterling 7.44  US dollar  43.38    The amounts of each of the five  currencies will be calculated  on July 29, 2022 (the transition date) in accordance with the  new weights. The next review of the method of valuation of  the SDR will take place in 2027, unless developments in the  interim justify an earlier review.   2.2  SDR interest rate  The SDR interest rate provides the basis for basic charges  levied on credit outstanding (see Note 17), interest on SDR  holdings (see Note 6), remuneration paid on members’  reserve tranche positions (see Note 18), and interest on  borrowings (see Note 14).   The SDR interest rate is determined weekly by reference to a  weighted average of yields or rates on short-term instruments  in the money markets of the members whose currencies are  included in the SDR valuation basket:   SDR basket currency Yield or rate  Chinese renminbi Three-month benchmark yield for China  Treasury bonds as published by the China  Central Depository and Clearing Co., Ltd.  Euro Three-month spot rate for euro area central  government bonds with a minimum rating of  AA published by the European Central  Bank  Japanese yen Three-month Treasury discount bills  Pound sterling Three-month Treasury bills  US dollar Three-month Treasury bills    The SDR interest rate is subject to a floor of 0.050 percent  and is rounded to three decimal places.   The average SDR interest rate was 0.107 percent per annum  and 0.077 percent per annum during the financial years  ended April 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively.  2.3  Use of estimates and judgement  The preparation of financ ial statements requires  management to make judgements, estimates, and assumptions that affect the app lication of accounting policies  and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.  Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an  ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021    14 recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised  and in any future periods affected.  The most significant estimates and judgements used in  applying accounting policies include expected credit losses measurement for credit outstanding and undrawn  commitments (see Notes 3.2.1.1 and 5.1), fair value  measurement of financial inst ruments (see Notes 3.10 and  8), and actuarial assumptions used in calculating the net assets/liabilities under retirement benefit plans (see Note 11.3).  3.  Summary of significant accounting policies  3.1  Financial instruments   Financial instruments include financial assets and financial liabilities described in Notes 3.2 and 3.7.  Measurement at initial recognition  Financial instruments are recognized when the General Department becomes a party to the contractual provisions of  the instrument. The General Department uses settlement  date accounting for all financial instruments except for  investments, which are accounted for using trade date  accounting (see Note 3.2.3). At initial recognition, a financial instrument is measured at it s fair value, which is best  evidenced by the transaction amount.   Derecognition Financial assets, or a portion thereof, are derecognized when  the contractual rights to rece ive the cash flows from the  assets have expired, or when they have been transferred and  either: (i) the General Department  transfers substantially all  the risks and rewards of owners hip; or (ii) the General  Department neither transfers nor retains substantially all the  risks and rewards of ownership but the General Department  has not retained control.   Financial liabilities are derecognized when they are  extinguished (i.e., when the obligation is discharged,  canceled, or expires).   Classification and subsequent measurement of  financial assets  A financial asset is classified on initial recognition based on two factors: the business model for managing the financial  asset and its contractual cash flow characteristics.   Financial assets that are held for collection of contractual  cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and intere st are measured at amortized  cost (AC). Interest income fr om these financial assets is  included in the statements of  income using the effective interest method. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is  recognized in the statements of income.   Financial assets that are held for collection of contractual  cash flows and for selling, where the assets’ cash flows  represent solely payments of principal and interest, would be  measured at fair value through other comprehensive income  (FVOCI). The General Departm ent did not have financial  assets at FVOCI during the financial years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021.  All other financial assets that do not meet the criteria to be  measured at AC or FVOCI are measured at fair value, with  changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss (FVPL).  Impairment  At each reporting date, the General Department assesses on  a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses (ECL)  associated with its financial assets at AC and with the  undrawn balances under its lending commitments. The  measurement of ECL reflects: (i) an unbiased and probability-weighted amou nt that is determined by evaluating  a range of possible outcomes; (ii) the time value of money; and (iii) reasonable and suppor table information that is  available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date about past events, current conditions, and forecasts of future economic conditions.   If the General Department neede d to recognize ECL, they  would be recorded as impairment allowances for assets at AC and as a liability provision for undrawn commitments.   Should any financial asset become credit-impaired, interest  income would be calculated for it by applying the effective interest rate to its amortized co st (i.e., net of the impairment  allowance).  Classification and subsequent measurement of  financial liabilities  Derivative financial liabilities are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss.   All other financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost. Interest expense from these financial liabilities is included in the statements of income using t he effective interest method.   3.2  Financial assets  3.2.1  Currencies  Currencies are financial assets that consist of members’  currencies held by the GRA with designated depositories, in  the form of account balances or non-interest-bearing  promissory notes that ar e encashable by the GRA on  demand. All currencies in the GRA are classified at AC. I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021     15  Usable currencies are currencies of members considered  to be in a sufficiently strong external position that they can  be used to finance GRA transactions with other members.    Currencies of members that are not considered to have a  sufficiently strong balance of payments and reserves  position to finance GRA transactions with other members are presented as other currencies.    Holdings of member currencies that represent purchases of usable currencies or SDRs in exchange for their own  currencies are presented as credit outstanding (see Note  3.2.1.1).   The currency balances in the statements of financial position include receivables and payables arising from currency  revaluations (see Note 5).  3.2.1.1  Credit outstanding and charges  Credit outstanding is a financial asset that represents  financing provided to members under the various GRA financing facilities (see Note 1.1). Members receive financing  in the GRA by purchasing SDRs or usable currencies in  exchange for their own currencies. GRA credit is repaid by  members by repurchasing holdings of their currencies in  exchange for SDRs or usable currencies.   Charges and fees  The GRA earns interest, referred to as basic charges, on  members’ use of GRA credit (see Note 17). Basic charges are recognized using the e ffective interest method.    In addition to basic charges, outstanding GRA credit is also subject to level-based and time-based surcharges (see Note 17). Surcharges are recognized when the relevant  level-based and time-based thresholds on credit outstanding  set by the Executive Board are reached.   Charges not received from members within the required  timeframe are recovered by the GRA under the burden- sharing mechanism, through adjustments to increase the rate  of charge for debtor member s and decrease the rate of  remuneration on members’ reserve tranche positions (see  Note 13.1).   A service charge is levied by the GRA on all purchases from  the GRA except reserve tranche purchases. Service charges are paid when the purchases are made and are recognized  as income upon payment.   A commitment fee is levied on the amount available for  financing under an arrangement for each 12-month period of  the arrangement. Except for SLL arrangements, commitment  fees are refunded as the member makes purchases under  the relevant arrangement. A prorated commitment fee is also  refunded for all arrangements in case of an arrangement’s cancellation. At the arrangement’s expiration or cancellation, any unrefunded amount is recognized as income. Pending refund or recognition as income, commitment fees are  recognized as part of other li abilities in the statements of  financial position. For SLL arrangements, the commitment  fee is nonrefundable upon purchases. Accordingly,  commitment fee income is recognized on a straight-line basis  over the duration of the SLL arrangement.  Impairment of credit outstanding The General Department’s assessment for impairment of its credit outstanding is grounded in  the context of the nature of  the IMF’s financing and its un ique institutional status:     The IMF has a unique relationship with its member countries, all of which are shar eholders in the institution.    IMF financing under arrangements is linked to regular reviews of performance under a program of economic  policies that the member commits to in order to overcome  balance of payments problems, return to external viability, and repay the IMF.    The IMF employs a comprehensive set of measures to mitigate credit risk (see Note 4.2.1).   The IMF also has de facto pref erred creditor status, which  has been recognized by the official community and generally accepted by private creditors.  Taken together, these factor s significantly reduce the  likelihood of the General Department incurring credit losses.   The General Department has not recognized any impairment  losses since inception. Also, unlik e large financial institutions  in the private sector, the General Department’s credit portfolio consists of a relatively small number of exposures to  its member countries, with eac h member’s circumstances  varying. Therefore, a stat istical approach to credit risk  assessment, such as probability of default (PD) and loss given default (LGD) modeling, as typically followed in the financial sector is neither feasible nor appropriate for the  General Department.   Similarly, the assessment of t he General Department’s credit  risk cannot rely on external credit risk ratings. Due to its  unique characteristics, the IMF’ s credit risk exposure is not  comparable to sovereign credit risk faced by commercial  financial entities and, as a cooperative member organization,  the IMF does not produce its own internal credit rating  grades. Accordingly, credit risk for the General Department is  assessed holistically based on  qualitative an d quantitative  considerations pertaining to each debtor member, such as  the status of the economic programs underlying IMF  financing, the member’s cooperation on policy  implementation and timely settlement of IMF financial obligations, and forward-looking assessment of the member’s  capacity to repay. I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021    16 The General Department has developed a model for ECL  estimation based on changes in credit quality since initial  recognition, where credit qualit y is referred to as Stage 1,  Stage 2, and Stage 3. Credit out standing for which credit risk  has increased significantly since initial recognition (Stage 2), or that is credit-impaired (S tage 3), has its ECL measured on  a lifetime basis. Credit outstan ding for which there has been  no significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition  (Stage 1) has its ECL measured as a portion of lifetime ECL  that result from default events possible within the next  12 months.  The key judgements and assumptions adopted by the  General Department in t he measurement of ECL are  discussed below :  (i) Definition of defaul t and credit-impaired   The General Department considers a member country to be  in default when it is six months or more overdue in settling its  financial obligations to the General Department. This rebuts the presumption that  default occurs no later than 90 days  past due, reflecting the nature of the IMF’s financing and its unique institutional status as well as consistency with the  threshold for internal risk management purposes. Credit outstanding is considered cred it-impaired when the obligation  has defaulted.   (ii) Significant increase in credit risk  The General Department assesses whether a significant increase in credit risk has occurred on a member-by-member  basis by comparing the risk of default at the reporting date  with the risk of default at t he date of the most recent  disbursement to the debtor member. The assessment is  performed on each reporting date and takes into account a  range of qualitative and quantitative criteria, including  overdue obligations to the IMF, signals of noncooperation by  the member, and forward-looking indicators of capacity to repay the IMF. The criteria used to identify significant  increases in credit risk are monitored and reviewed for  appropriateness at least annually.   The assessment does not rely on any single factor and may,  on the basis of other relevant considerations, rebut the  presumption that credit risk has increased significantly when contractual payments are mo re than 30 days past due.  During the financial years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021, the General Department did not have any member more than 30 days past due, except for one member in protracted  arrears at April 30, 2021, which were subsequently settled  (see Note 5.2).  (iii) Low credit risk   The General Department assumes that the credit risk of a member country has not increased significantly since initial recognition if the member is determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date, as defined below.   Credit risk related to the General Department’s exposure to a member country is considered low if: (i) it has a low risk of default; (ii) the member country  has a strong capacity to meet  its contractual cash flow obligations in the near term; and (iii) adverse changes in economic and business conditions in  the longer term may, but will not necessarily, reduce the  ability of the member country to fulfill its contractual cash flow  obligations.   (iv) Measuring ECL  ECL are determined by comparing expected cash flows with contractual cash flows and discounting the expected cash  shortfalls at the effective interest  rate, which is the basic rate  of charge. ECL are estima ted by assessing a range of  possible outcomes in light of expected future economic  conditions, weighted according to the assessed probability of  each outcome. This entails considerable judgement and uncertainty about the estimates.   For the purpose of ECL measurement, financial safeguards that are integral to the IMF’s financial structure and  operations are also considered, such as the burden-sharing  mechanism to compensa te the IMF for loss of income due to  overdue payments (see Note  13.1) and the Special  Contingent Account (SCA-1) to pr otect the IMF in case of the  ultimate failure of a member to repay its overdue obligations to the GRA (see Note 13.2).  Write-off  In the unlikely event that a member with credit outstanding (i) withdraws from the IMF; ( ii) repudiates its outstanding  obligations to the General Depar tment; and (iii) there are no  prospects of recovering amounts due to the General  Department in the foreseeable future, the IMF would  recognize the ultimate loss and the withdrawn member’s credit outstanding to the G eneral Department would be  written off.   3.2.2  SDR holdings   SDR holdings represent SDRs held by the GRA (see Note 6).  SDR holdings are measured at AC.  Interest on SDR holdings is recognized using the effective  interest method.   3.2.3  Investments   Investments are financial assets that include equity securities, real estate investment trusts (REITs), private  infrastructure debt, fixed-in come securities, short-term  investments, fixed-term deposits, and derivative assets. Derivative liabilities are disclosed as part of other liabilities in  the statements of fi nancial position.  I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021     17 Investments in each of the tw o subaccounts are managed in  accordance with their respective investment strategy (see  Note 7) and their performance is evaluated on a fair value  basis. The business model for the invested portfolios focuses on achieving fair value gains. Accordingly, these securities  are classified at FVPL. Funds pending suitable investment in  accordance with the investment  strategy may be kept in  fixed-term deposits, which are measured at amortized cost.  Purchases and sales of investments are recognized on the  trade date. The corresponding investment trades receivable  or payable are recognized in other assets and other liabilities,  respectively, pending settlement of a transaction.  Investment income compri ses interest income on  investments at AC, interest and dividend income, and  realized and unrealized gains and losses from FVPL investments, including currency valuation differences arising  from exchange rate movements against the SDR, net of all  trading-related fees.  Interest income from investments is recognized using the  effective interest method. Dividend income is recognized  based on the ex-dividend date.  3.3  Cash and cash equivalents   Usable currencies and SDR holdings are considered cash and cash equivalents in the statements of cash flows.  3.4  Gold holdings  Gold holdings (acquired prior to the Second Amendment of  the IMF’s Articles of Agreement in April 1978) are carried at  historical cost using the spec ific identification method. The  carrying value is determined by the restrictions on the use of  the IMF’s gold holdings and the di sposition of profits from the  sale of gold. In accordance with the provisions of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, whenever the IMF sells gold that was  held on the date of the e ffectiveness of the Second  Amendment of the IMF’s Articles  of Agreement, that portion  of the proceeds equal to the hist orical cost must be placed in  the GRA. Any proceeds in excess of the historical cost will be held in the SDA or transferred to the Endowment Subaccount  of the IA (see Note 9). The IMF may also sell such gold  holdings to those members that were members on August 1, 1975, in exchange for their currencies and at a price equal to  the historical cost.  3.5  Property, plant and equipment and intangible  assets  Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are  measured at historical cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization. Property, plant and equipment and intangible  assets are capitalized and depreciated or amortized over the  estimated remaining useful lives using the straight-line method. Buildings are deprecia ted over 30 years and other  property, plant and equipment over 3 to 20 years. Leasehold  improvements are depreciated ov er the term of the lease  agreement. Software is amortized over three to five years.  3.6  Post-employment benefits  The IMF sponsors various post-employment benefit plans for its employees, which include defined benefit and other  post-employment benefits such as medical and life insurance  benefits (see Note 11).  The net asset/liability under each retirement benefits plan  recognized in the statements of financial position is the  present value of the defined ben efit obligation less the fair  value of the plan assets. Changes resulting from remeasurements are reported in other comprehensive  income. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined using the projecte d unit credit method by  discounting the estimated future cash outflows using market  yields on high-quality corporate bonds.   Net periodic pension cost includes service cost and net  interest cost on the net asse ts/liabilities under retirement  benefit plans.  3.7  Financial liabilities  3.7.1  Special Contingent Account The SCA-1 was used by the General Department to  accumulate precautionary balances under the burden- sharing mechanism (see Note 13.2) against possible credit  default. Balances in the SCA-1 are akin to refundable non-interest-bearing deposits.   3.7.2  Borrowings   Borrowings are financial liabilities that represent financing  received under the various borrowing arrangements  (see Note 14).  Interest expense on borrowings is calculated by applying the  effective interest method.   3.7.3  Quota subscriptions   Members’ quota subscriptions are financial liabilities that  represent subscription payments by members, including  payments as a result of quota increases (see Note 15.1). An increase in quota subscription for an existing member  becomes effective when the member both consents to the  quota increase and makes the actual payment (provided that any other requirements for the effectiveness of the specific  quota increase are met), and the increase is recorded in the financial statements on the payment  date. Typically, about a  quarter of a member’s quota subscription (reserve asset portion) is paid either in SDRs or in the currencies of other members specified by the IMF, or in any combination of I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021    18 SDRs and such currencies; and the remainder is paid in the  member’s own currency.   Quota subscriptions are cla ssified as liabilities in the  statements of financial position, as they embody an  unconditional repayment obligation in the case of a member’s  withdrawal from the IMF.  3.7.3.1  Reserve tranche positions and remuneration  A member acquires a reserve tranche position in the GRA in  exchange for the reserve asset portion of its quota subscription payment, and from the use of the member’s  currency in the GRA’s transactions or operations (see  Note 15.2).   The GRA pays interest, referr ed to as remuneration, on a  remunerated portion of t he member’s reserve tranche  position (see Note 18). Remuneration expense is recognized  on an accrual basis.   3.8  Provisions  Provisions are recognized when the IMF has a current legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is  probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made. Provisions are measured at  the present value of the amoun ts that are expected to be  paid to settle the obligations.  3.9  Foreign currency translation  Transactions denominated in currencies and not in SDRs are  recorded at the rate of exchange on the date of the  transaction. Assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies are reported using the SDR exchange rate on the  date of the financial statements. Exchange differences  arising from the settlement of transactions at rates different  from those at the originating date of the transactions are  included in the determination of net income.  3.10  Fair value measurement  Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between  market participants at the m easurement date. A fair value  measurement is based on th e presumption that the  transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either in the principal market for the asset or liability or, in the absence of a principal market, in the most  advantageous market.  A three-level fair value hierarchy is used to determine fair  value under which financial instruments are categorized  based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique. The fair value hierarchy has the following levels:  When the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset  or liability fall within multiple le vels of the hierarchy, the level  within which the fair value me asurement is categorized is  based on the lowest-level input t hat is significant to the fair  value measurement of the instrument in its entirety. Thus, a  Level 3 fair value measurement may include inputs that are  both observable and unobservable. Transfers in and out of  the fair value hierarchy levels  are recognized at the end of  the reporting period.  The valuation techniques used to determine fair value are  described in Note 8.  3.11  Amendments to existing standards that became  effective in the financial year ended April 30, 2022  Amendments to IFRS 9, “Financial Instruments”, and IFRS 7,  “Financial Instruments: Disclosures” were issued in August 2020 to address financial reporting issues related to the  reform of an interest rate benchmark, including its  replacement with alternative benchmark rates. The  amendments are effective for annual periods starting on or  after January 1, 2021, and were adopted by the General  Department on May 1, 2021. The amendments had no  material effect on the General Department’s financial  statements.  3.12  Amendments to existing standards effective in  future years  The following amendments to existing standards issued by  the IASB will become effective in  future financial years.   Amendments to IFRS 9, “Financial Instruments” were issued in May 2020 to clarify certain aspects of derecognition of financial liabilities. The amendm ents are effective for annual  periods starting on or after January 1, 2022. The amendments will be adopted by t he General Department for  the financial year ending Ap ril 30, 2023, and are not  expected to have a material effect on the General Department’s financial statements.  Amendments to IAS 1, “Pre sentation of Financial  Statements” and IFRS Prac tice Statement 2, “Making  Materiality Judgements” were issued in February 2021 to  help entities apply materiality judgements to accounting  policy disclosures. The amendments are effective for annual Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical  assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the  measurement date;   Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly  (i.e., derived from prices);  Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021     19 periods starting on or after January 1, 2023. The  amendments will be adopted by t he General Department for  the financial year ending Ap ril 30, 2024, and are not  expected to have a material effect on the General Department’s financial statements.  Amendments to IAS 8, “Accounting Policies, Changes in  Accounting Estimates and Errors” were issued in February  2021 to clarify the definition of accounting estimate. The  amendments are effective for annual periods starting on or  after January 1, 2023. The amendments will be adopted by  the General Department for the financial year ending  April 30, 2024, and are not expected to have a material effect on the General Department’ s financial statements.  4.  Financial risk management   The General Department is exposed to various types of  operational and financial risks, including credit, market, and  liquidity risks.  4.1  Risk management framework  By virtue of its role establishe d through the IMF’s Articles of  Agreement, the IMF faces a range of financial and nonfinancial risks. The Executive Board has approved a risk  acceptance statement guiding risk acceptance and  assessment across the IMF’s activities. The IMF has adopted the three lines of defense model for risk management.   Risks inherent in day-to-day o perations are mitigated by  establishing and main taining a system of internal controls.   A risk management function is responsible for developing  and maintaining the risk management framework, fostering the development of  risk management tools, and  reporting on the General Depart ment’s overall risk profile,  highlighting areas where additional mitigation efforts are needed.    An internal audit function is responsible for providing an independent assessment of  the effectiveness of  governance and internal control processes.    Oversight is provided by committees established to monitor  and make decisions in specific risk areas, which supports the  cycle of risk assessment, ownership, and mitigation vis-à-vis risk acceptance.   4.2  Financial assets and liabilities other than  investments  Financial assets and liabilities other than investments are  exposed to credit, market, and liquidity risks. 4.2.1  Credit risk on financial assets and liabilities other than  investments  Credit risk is the risk of suffering financial losses, should any  of the IMF’s members fail to fulfill their financial obligations to the GRA. Credit risk arises on credit outstanding and  undrawn committed amounts under approved financing  commitments.  Credit risk is inherent in the IMF’s unique role in the  international monetary system  because the IMF has limited  ability to diversify its credit portfolio and generally provides  financing when other sources of credit are not available to a  member. In addition, the IMF’s credit concentration is generally high due to the nature of the financial assistance  provided to its member countries.  Measures to help mitigate the IMF’s credit risk in financing  arrangements include program design and conditionality,  which serve to help member countries solve their balance of  payments problems within the period of an IMF-supported program and to provide the ne eded assurances that the  member will be able to repay the IMF. Other risk mitigating policies include access limits, post financing assessments,  surcharge policies, preventive and remedial measures for  dealing with overdue financial obligations, and the burden- sharing mechanism (see Note 13).   The IMF has established limits on overall access to  resources in the GRA, except for the FCL arrangements that are not subject to any access limits (for limits applicable to  SLL arrangements, see below). The annual limit is normally  set at 145 percent of a member ’s quota, with a cumulative  limit of 435 percent of a mem ber’s quota (net of scheduled  repurchases). In response to the COVID-19 crisis, the annual  limit was temporarily increased to 245 percent of quota  annually for the period from July 13, 2020, through  December 31, 2021.   Access in excess of these limits can be granted in  exceptional circumstances. Except for PLL arrangements,  there is no prespecified maximum on exceptional access to IMF resources, which is assessed on a case-by-case basis in  accordance with the policy framework on exceptional access.  The IMF assesses factors such as the size of balance of  payments needs, the member’s debt sustainability and its  ability to regain access to financing from other sources, the  member’s capacity to repay the Fund, and the strength of  policies to be adopted.   PLL arrangements have a cumulative access limit of  500 percent of quota (net of scheduled repurchases). Access  under a six-month PLL arrangement is subject to a limit of  125 percent of quota. In exceptional circumstances where a member is experiencing or has the potential to experience  larger short-term balance of payments needs due to the I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021    20 impact of exogenous shocks, including heightened regional  or global stress conditions, access under a six-month PLL  arrangement is subject to a higher limit of 250 percent of  quota.  SLL arrangements have revolving access, and multiple  purchases and repurchases may take place during the  course of the arrangement, subj ect to a limit of 145 percent  of quota on the total credit outstanding at any given date under current or any prior SLL arrangements.   Further, in September 2020, the IMF established policy  safeguards when a member requests financing with  combined access to GRA and Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRG Trust) resources in excess of specified  thresholds. These thresholds are set at the same levels that  trigger application of the GRA exceptional access framework.  The safeguards are also broadly aligned with the criteria and  procedures applied in the GRA exceptional access  framework described above. There were no limits on combined access to GRA and PRG Trust resources prior to  September 2020.  The annual limit for RFI purchases is normally set at 50  percent of a member’s quota, with a cumulative limit of 100  percent of a member’s quota ( net of scheduled repurchases).  These limits were temporarily increased to 100 percent of  quota annually and 150 percent of  quota cumulatively (net of  scheduled repurchases) for the period from April 6, 2020,  through June 30, 2023.  Purchases under SBA and EFF arrangements are made in  tranches and are subject to conditionality in the form of performance criteria, indicative targets, structural  benchmarks, and prior actions, as well as regular reviews by  the Executive Board.   In addition, the IMF has adopted a safeguards policy to  mitigate the risk of misuse of resources and a misreporting policy to deal with incorrect reporting of data or performance  against any conditions under an IMF-supported program.  Safeguards assessments of member central banks are undertaken to provide the IMF with reasonable assurance  that the central bank’s legal structure, governance, control,  reporting, and auditing systems are adequate to maintain the integrity of its operations and to manage resources, including  IMF disbursements. When IMF resources are provided as  direct budget financing to the government, the safeguards policy also requires that IMF disbursements be deposited at  the central bank, and that an appropriate framework  agreement between the central bank and the government be  in place to ensure timely servicing of the member’s financial  obligations to the IMF. Further, a fiscal safeguards review of the state treasury is requir ed for cases where a member requests exceptional access, and at least 25 percent of IMF funds are expected to be used fo r direct budget financing.   The maximum credit risk exposure is the carrying value of the IMF’s credit outstanding a nd undrawn commitments.   4.2.1.1  Credit outstanding  Credit outstanding comprised SDR 93,031 million and  SDR 89,788 million at April 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively  (see Note 5). The concentration of GRA outstanding credit by  region was as follows:     The use of credit in the GRA by the largest users was as  follows:    The five largest users of GRA credit at April 30, 2022, and 2021, in descending order, were Argentina, Egypt, Ukraine,  Pakistan, and Ecuador. Credit outstanding by member is  presented in Schedule 1.  In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant number  of countries have benefited from emergency financial  assistance under the RFI (see Note 5.1), including 21  countries with a total disbursed amount of SDR 9,480 million  that did not have credit outst anding from the IMF at March  31, 2020. There is no ex-post program-based conditionality or reviews under the RFI, with overall conditionality limited.  4.2.1.2  Undrawn commitments  Undrawn commitments under GRA arrangements amounted  to SDR 102,614 million and SDR 93,457 million at April 30,  2022, and 2021, respectively. Commitments and undrawn balances under current arrangements are presented in  Schedule 3.   April 30, 2022  April 30, 2021  (in millions of SDRs and as a percentage  of total GRA credit outstanding)   Africa 12,305 13.2% 10,438 11.6%  Asia and Pacific 1,833 2.0% 1,886 2.1%  Europe  8,675 9.3% 9,914 11.0%  Middle East and Central  Asia 24,864 26.7% 24,490 27.3%  Western Hemisphere  45,354 48.8% 43,060 48.0%  Total 93,031 100.0% 89,788 100.0%   April 30, 2022  April 30, 2021   (in millions of SDRs and as a percentage of  total GRA credit outstanding)   Largest user of credit  33,221 35.7% 31,914 35.5%  Three largest users of  credit  54,708 58.8% 52,294 58.2%  Five largest users   of credit  65,001 69.9% 62,067 69.1%  I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021     21 No purchases under RFIs had been approved by the  Executive Board, but not yet disbursed at April 30, 2022  (SDR 630 million at April 30, 2021).   The undrawn commitments under GRA arrangements have  also increased as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic (see  Note 1.5) as the IMF has approved new financial assistance under its lending arrangements (including to four countries  that had not had a lending arrangement with, or credit  outstanding to the IMF at Ma rch 31, 2020) and augmented  existing lending arrangements to accommodate urgent new  needs arising from the impact of the pandemic.  4.2.2  Market risk on financial assets and liabilities other than  investments Market risk is the risk that the fa ir value or future cash flows  of financial instruments will fl uctuate because of changes in  market prices. Market risk for financial assets and liabilities other than investments includes interest rate risk and  exchange rate risk.  4.2.2.1  Interest rate risk  Interest rate risk is the risk t hat future net cash flows will  fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. All interest-bearing financial instru ments other than investments  of the General Department accr ue interest either at the SDR  interest rate or at a rate that is linked to the SDR interest rate  (see Note 2.2). Interest rate risk is primarily managed by  linking the rate of charge directly, by means of a fixed margin, to the cost of financing (which is equal to the SDR  interest rate).   4.2.2.2  Exchange rate risk  Exchange rate risk is the risk that the General Department’s  financial position and cash flows will be affected by  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.    The General Department has no exchange rate risk  exposure on its holdings of members’ currencies in the GRA because members maintain the value of such  holdings in SDR terms (see Note 5).    The General Department has other assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than SDRs and makes  administrative payments largely in US dollars, but the exchange rate risk exposure associated with these  activities is limited.    The General Department has no exchange rate exposure  from its current borrowing arrangements because all  drawings are denominated in SDRs.  4.2.3  Liquidity risk on financial assets and liabilities other than investments  Liquidity risk is the risk to the General Department of  nonavailability of resources to meet the financing needs of  members and its own obligations. The IMF must have usable resources available to meet members’ demand for IMF  financing. While the IMF’s resources are largely of a  revolving nature, uncertainties in the timing and amount of  credit extended to members during financial crises expose the IMF to liquidity risk. Moreover, the IMF must also stand  ready to provide resources for unexpected needs, for  example, to: (i) meet, upon a member’s representation of  need, potential demands for a drawing on the member’s  reserve tranche; and (ii) authorize drawings to meet demands for encashment of creditor claims under the New  Arrangements to Borrow (NAB) or the bilateral borrowing  agreements (see Note 14).  The IMF manages its liquidity risk by closely scrutinizing  developments in its liquidity position. The IMF’s main liquidity  measure—Forward Commitment Capacity -represents the  IMF’s capacity to make new GRA resources available to its  members over the following 12 months (see Schedule 2).   Long-term liquidity needs are addressed by reviewing the  adequacy of quota-based resources. General reviews of  members’ quotas are conducted at regular intervals to  evaluate the adequacy of quot a-based resources to meet  members’ demand for IMF financing. The IMF may also borrow to supplement its quota resources (see Note 14).  Short-term liquidity needs for financing activities are reviewed  and approved by the Executive Board on a periodic basis  through a financial transactions plan for quota resources and  the resource mobilization plan for borrowed resources.   4.2.3.1  Maturity profile of fi nancial assets and liabilities other  than investments  Depending on the type of financing instrument, repurchase  periods for GRA credit vary from 3¼ to 10 years. Scheduled  and overdue repurchases of outstanding GRA credit are  summarized below:      Repayments of outstanding borrowings are determined  according to the schedule of repurchases of credit that was  financed by borrowed resources. They also take into account  the maximum maturity of outstanding borrowings, which was  April 30, 2022  April 30, 2021   Financial year (in millions of SDRs )  2022 —  8,961  2023 19,198  19,777  2024 23,252  24,006  2025  18,497  18,183  2026 9,494  7,842  2027 6,446  3,692  2028 and beyond 16,144  7,185  Overdue —  142  Total 93,031  89,788  I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021    22 equal to 10 years for all outstanding borrowings. Scheduled  repayments of outstanding borrowings are summarized  below:    Repurchases during the financial years ended April 30, 2022,  and 2021, included advance repurchases of SDR 3,797 million and SDR 3,677 million, respectively.  These advance repurchases resulted in earlier than  scheduled repayments of outstanding borrowings of SDR 1,134 million and SDR 2,094 million, respectively.  Future interest payments on borrowings calculated at the  SDR interest rate at April 30, 2022, represent SDR 10 million for the financial year ending April 30, 2023. Thereafter, a total  of SDR 3 million will be paid th rough the last repayment date.  Usable and other currencies, SDR holdings, and quota subscriptions do not have maturity dates.  4.3  Investments  Investments are exposed to credit, market, and liquidity risks.  4.3.1  Credit risk on investments  Credit risk on investments repr esents the potential loss if  issuers and counterparties were to default on their  contractual obligations.   Credit risk in the IA is minimized by limiting fixed-income  investments to financial instrum ents with a credit rating at the  time of acquisition:   For the Fixed-Income Subaccount, effective January 12,  2022 the minimum credit rating is set at the equivalent of  BBB– (based on Standard & Poor’s long-term rating scale)  for corporate bonds and BBB+ for all other assets (at least A for all assets before January 12, 2022).    For the Endowment Subaccount, the minimum credit rating is set at BBB+ for so vereign bonds and BBB– for  corporate bonds and private infrastructure debt. Limited holdings in the Endowment Subaccount of corporate  bonds and private infrastructure debt rated below BBB–  are permitted under the Rules and Regulations of the  Investment Account.   Exempt from the credit rating requirement are instruments  issued by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS),  which does not have a credit ra ting, central bank deposits,  and short-term instruments.  The carrying amount of the fixed-income instruments represents the maximum exposure to credit risk. The credit  risk exposure for fixed-income instruments in the IA, at the  end of the respective reporting periods, was as follows:   Fixed-Income Subaccount    April 30, 2022 April 30, 2021  (as a percentage of total investments in  fixed-income instruments)   Not rated (BIS) — 0.0% 2,557 15.6%  AAA  5,422 29.3% 5,918 36.2%  AA+ to AA–  7,075 38.3% 3,435 21.0%  A+ to A  5,741 31.1% 4,305 26.4%  BBB+ 240 1.3% 125 0.8%  Total  18,478 100.0% 16,340 100.0%      Counterparty risk for derivative instruments is mitigated by strict exposure limits, cr edit rating requirements, and  collateral requirements. The ma ximum exposure to credit risk  for derivative instruments is the amount of any unrealized  gains on such contracts.   The credit risk exposure for derivative instruments in the  Fixed-Income Subaccount amounted to SDR 106 million and  SDR 38 million at April 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The  credit risk exposure for derivative instruments in the Endowment Subaccount amounted to SDR 58 million and  SDR 5 million at April 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively.  4.3.2  Market risk on investments  Market risk is the risk that the fa ir value or future cash flows  of financial instruments will fl uctuate because of changes in  market prices. Market risk for investments incl udes interest  rate risk, exchange rate risk, and other price risks.  The investment objectives of the Fixed-Income and  Endowment Subaccounts differ, and the investment  strategies, including asset allocation and risk tolerance, are  tailored for each of the subacc ounts, thereby exposing them  to different types of market risk.

General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021     23 4.3.2.1  Fixed-Income Subaccount  The Fixed-Income Subaccount holds debt obligations of a  broad range of issuers within limits defined by the Rules and  Regulations of the IA (see Note 7.1 for the eligible investments). Market risk is mitigated through asset class  diversification and within asset classes through broad security selection.   The Fixed-Income Subaccount authorizes the use of  derivative instruments for managing interest rate risk, currency hedging, or reducing co sts in the context of portfolio  balancing, benchmark replication, and market access. Safeguards are in place against short selling and financial leverage.  Exchange rate risk is mitigated by hedging investments  denominated in non-SDR currencies into SDR basket currencies with the objective of preserving the Fixed-Income  Subaccount’s SDR basket composition.  4.3.2.2  Endowment Subaccount   Investments are divided into eight categories, which are  subject to varying market risks and benefits from  diversification properties (see  Note 7.2 for the eligible  investments). Market risk is mitigated through asset class  diversification and within asset classes through broad security selection.   Effective January 12, 2022, except for the allocation to  emerging market equities, which may be managed actively, all Endowment Subaccount assets shall be managed  passively (prior to January 12, 2022, the Endowment  Subaccount was split into the passively-managed portfolio managed in accordance with the strategic asset allocation  and the actively-managed portfolio, which could comprise up  to 10 percent of the Endowment assets, invested in the same  asset categories with target  shares for fixed-income  instruments and equities with out specific allocation  requirements within those shares).   The Endowment Subaccount authorizes the use of derivative  instruments for managing interest rate risk, currency hedging, or reducing costs in the cont ext of portfolio balancing,  benchmark replication, and market access.   Because the IMF’s administrative expenditures are largely in  US dollars and the Endowment Subaccount’s general  objective is to contribute to  covering such expenditures (see  Note 1.2), the performance of the Endowment Subaccount is  measured in US dollars as the base currency but translated into SDRs for financial reporting. The Rules and Regulations  of the IA provide for hedging against the exchange rate risk  for fixed-income instruments denominated in developed  market currencies vis-à-vis the US dollar. The valuation changes from exchange rate fluctuations are included in the determination of investment income.   4.3.2.3  Value at risk  Exposures to market risk, including interest rate, exchange rate, and other price risks, are measured using VaR, which  considers known market risks in each of the asset categories  and the effect of asset class diversification. VaR estimates  reported below represent the maximum potential loss in  value of the assets over the ne xt year due to adverse market  movements with a 95 percent c onfidence level. There is a  1 in 20 chance that annual losses on investment assets are equal to or exceed the reported VaR. Losses in a single year could exceed the reported VaR by a significant amount.  The VaR model is based on historical simulations with a  three-year look back period and monthly overlapping risk factor returns for each individual instrument in the portfolios  to produce plausible future scenarios based on these  simulations. In each simulation scenario, risk factor data on the valuation date is shocked according to past observations  and each instrument is repriced, resulting in a hypothetical  empirical distribution of re turns. There is no standard  methodology for estimating VaR, and the modeling of the market risk characteristics of the investments involves many  assumptions and some limited pr oxy or substitutes. Different  assumptions or methodologies would produce significantly different VaR estimates.   The VaR for the Fixed-Income Subaccount portfolio was as  follows:   April 30, 2022 April 30, 2021   (in millions of SDRs )  Tranche 1 (see Note 7) 169 65  Tranche 2 (see Note 7) 107 58  Diversification effects (26) (47)  Total Fixed-Income Subaccount 250 76   I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021    24 The VaR for the Endowment Subaccount portfolio was as  follows:   April 30, 2022 April 30, 2021   (in millions of SDRs )  Passively managed portfolio:   Developed market equities 397 493  Emerging market equities 182 203  Global Sovereign bonds 66 —  Developed market sovereign bonds n/a1 65  Developed market corporate bonds 60 51  Emerging market bonds n/a1 17  US Treasury Inflation-Protected        Securities 68 52  Real estate investment trusts 175 97  Private infrastructure debt 17 5  Infrastructure equities 55 —  Diversification effects (296) (236)  Total for passively managed  portfolio 724 747  Actively managed portfolio:    Fixed-income securities — 10  Equity securities — 39  Diversification effects — (11)  Total for actively managed portfolio — 38  1 Following the changes to the investment  strategy approved by the Executive  Board on January 12, 2022, the investment categories of developed market  sovereign bonds and emerging market bonds were restructured into the global sovereign bonds category.     4.3.3  Liquidity risk on investments  Liquidity risk on investments refers to the risk that an investment will not have an active buyer or seller when  traded, which could negatively affect the price of the  investment.  The IA’s liquidity needs are low and the liquidity risk is  minimal because both subaccounts hold the majority of their resources in readily marketable short-term investments. 4.3.3.1  Maturity profile of investments The maturities of the fixed-income securities and derivatives  in the Fixed-Income Subaccount were as follows:     April 30, 2022 April 30, 2021  Financial year  (in millions of SDRs)   2022  — 6,909  2023 5,659 3,131  2024 5,294 2,179  2025  3,346 1,554  2026 2,110 1,254  2027 1,535 425  2028 and beyond 891 1,154  Total 18,835 16,606   The maturities of the fixed-income securities and derivatives  in the Endowment Subaccount were as follows:   April 30, 2022 April 30, 2021  Financial year  (in millions of SDRs)   2022  — 392  2023 496 376  2024 344 396  2025  388 455  2026 390 461  2027 361 303  2028 and beyond 1,331 1,346  Total 3,310 3,729    Investments in both subaccounts largely represent liquid  investments, which could be sold earlier than their maturity,  whenever necessary.  4.4  Post-employment benefit plans  The General Department is exposed to investment, liquidity, and longevity risks associated wit h post-employment benefit  plans (the Plans). These risks are balanced a gainst the need  to meet the financial obligations of each plan. The Plans have adopted general guidelines on permissible investments and plan assets are invested a ccording to a strategic asset  allocation, which is expected to generate a rate of return at or in excess of the rate of growth in the Plans’ liabilities. The strategic asset allocation is reviewed periodically by the  Investment Committee. The strategic asset allocation is  designed to minimize the level of portfolio market risk  (volatility) for the targeted rate of return, while better aligning  portfolio volatility with the potential volatility of the Plans’  liabilities. Through a global, multiple-asset-class investment  approach, the portfolio risk is r educed for any targeted rate of  return, because asset class returns are not perfectly  correlated as regional and global economic, financial, and political events unfold. The Pl ans do not utilize specific,  targeted asset-liability matching  instruments or strategies I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021     25 such as annuities, longevity swaps, cash flow matching, or  duration matching.  The primary objective with respect to liquidity is to have  sufficient liquid resources available to pay benefits when due. This risk is monitored to ensure that payments due to the  participants and beneficiaries can be met from the holdings  of cash and highly liquid investments of the Plans.  4.5  Precautionary balances  Precautionary balances consist of the GRA reserves (excluding that portion repres enting the profits from the  2009–10 gold sales that have been earmarked for the  Endowment Subaccount), and t he balance in the SCA-1.  They are a key element of the Fund’s multilayered risk  management framework as they provide a buffer to protect  the Fund against unexpected losses resulting from credit,  income, and other financial risks. The Executive Board conducted an interim review of the adequacy of  precautionary balances in December 2021, ahead of the  standard two-year cycle given the need for close monitoring  due to the heightened uncertainty in the global economy  linked to the pandemic and the path and timing of the recovery. In concluding the interim review, the Executive  Board kept the medium-term indicative target and minimum  floor for precautionary balances at SDR 25 billion and SDR 15 billion, respectively (the medium-term indicative  target had been raised from SDR 20 billion to SDR 25 billion  during the previous review of the precautionary balances in November 2020).  During the December 2021 interim review, the Executive  Board approved a new approach for the treatment of retirement benefit plans in th e computation of precautionary  balances. This approach better reflects the role of precautionary balances as a long-term buffer for economic  and financial risks. Under the new approach, referred to as  the ‘economic basis’, the defined benefit liability of the plans  is measured using a discount rate that reflects the  expected  long-term return on plan assets. Any net liability measured under the economic basis is used in calculating precautionary balances in place of the net asset/liability  calculated under IAS 19 (see Note 11). However, any net  asset measured under the economic basis would not be used in calculating precautionary bala nces. The change took effect  from May 1, 2021. A one-time increase of SDR 205 million was made to precautionary ba lances as at that date,  reflecting the accumulated net loss to date, to align with the new measurement methodology.   At April 30, 2022, and 2021, precautionary balances  amounted to SDR 20.9 billion and SDR 20.0 billion,  respectively, and were calculated as follows:   April 30, 2022  April 30, 2021   (in millions of SDRs)  Special Reserve (Note 16)  13,692 11,347  General Reserve (Note 16) 12,832 12,003  Excluding profits from gold sales (4,403) (4,403)  Adjustment for net assets/liabilities under  retirement benefit plans under  IAS 19 (Note 11.2) (1,248) n/a  Adjustment for net liabilities  under retirement benefit plans  under the economic basis —1 n/a   SCA-1 (Note 13.2)   — 1,066  Total precautionary balances 20,873 20,013  1 The measurement of the retirement benefit plans under the economic basis  resulted in a net pension asset at April 30, 2022. As such, further adjustments to  precautionary balances were not required after excluding the net assets/liabilities determined under IAS 19.  5.  Currencies, including credit outstanding  Under the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, members are  required to maintain the value of the GRA’s holdings of their  currencies in terms of the SDR. Any depreciation or  appreciation in a member’s currency vis-à-vis the SDR gives  rise to a currency valuation adjustment receivable or payable that must be settled by the mem ber promptly after the end of  the financial year or at other times as requested by the IMF  or the member. Currency holdi ngs of SDR 454,718 million at  April 30, 2022, included receivables and payables arising  from those valuation adjustm ents of SDR 19,796 million and  SDR 13,073 million, respectively (currency holdings of  SDR 458,656 million at April 30, 2021, included receivables  and payables of SDR 25,618 million and SDR 10,182 million,  respectively).  All holdings of members’ currencies are typically revalued at  the IMF’s financial year-end.   5.1  Credit outstanding  At April 30, 2022, and 2021, members’ use of GRA credit  was represented by currency holdings of SDR 93,031 million  and SDR 89,788 million, respectively. I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021    26 Changes in credit outstanding under the various facilities of  the GRA were as follows:  1 Other facilities include legacy credit under Enlarged Access and Supplementary  Financing Facility.    1 Other facilities include legacy credit under Enlarged Access and Supplementary  Financing Facility.    5.1.1  Emergency financial assistance  The tables above reflect emergency financing under the RFI  that was provided by the General Department to members  facing urgent balance of payment s needs as a result of the  economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Credit  outstanding by member is presented in Schedule 1.  Following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the access  limits for RFI purchases were temporarily increased (see  Note 4.2.1).  5.1.2  Impairment analysis  The General Department has performed an impairment  analysis of credit outstanding  in accordance with its ECL  model (see Note 3.2.1.1). Based on this analysis, no loss  allowance was deemed to be necessary at April 30, 2022,  and 2021. As described in Note 3.2.1.1, the impairment analysis of the General Depa rtment’s credit outstanding  takes into account the unique  nature of the IMF’s financing  and its institutional status, and is performed holistically for  each debtor member based on  qualitative an d quantitative  considerations and taking into account relevant current developments, including the geopolitical and global economic developments as described in Note 1.5. In this context, the  results of the impairment ana lysis at April 30, 2022, and  2021, are not materially sensitive to reasonable changes in  input parameters of the ECL calculation.  5.2  Overdue obligations  At April 30, 2022, no member was six months or more overdue in settling its financial obligations to the General  Department (one member—Sudan—was six months or more  overdue in settling its financial obligations to the General Department at April 30, 2021).   On June 29, 2021, Sudan settled all of its overdue  obligations to the General Department, including GRA credit outstanding and overdue char ges of SDR 142 million and  SDR 738 million, respectively . Settlement of the overdue  charges generated burden-sharing refunds to members totaling SDR 611 million that had been previously collected  through burden-sharing adjustments to charges and  remuneration (see Notes 13.1, 13.2, 17, and 18).   6.  SDR holdings  The General Department can receive SDRs from members in  the settlement of their financia l obligations to the GRA and  quota subscription payments. In  addition, the GRA may use  or receive SDRs in transactions and operations with members, including the provision of financial assistance to  members, the receipt of charges and fees, and the payment of remuneration on reserve tranche positions or interest on  borrowings to member countries and lenders.  At April 30, 2022, and 2021, the SDR holdings of the General  Department amounted to SDR 22,270 million and  SDR 22,203 million, respectively.  The GRA earns interest on its SDR holdings at the same rate  as other holders of SDRs. Interest on SDR holdings during  the financial years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021, amounted to SDR 25 million and SDR 17 million,  respectively.  7.

Financial Statements of the General Department    PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, 655 New York Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20001   T: (202) 414 1000, www.pwc.com/us       Report of Independent Auditors     To the  Board of Governors of the International Monetary Fund     Opinion     We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the General Department of the International  Monetary Fund (the “Department”), which comprise the  statements of financial position as of April 30,  2022 and 2021, and the related statements of income, of comprehensive income, of changes in reserves,  retained earnings, and resources, and of cash flows for the years then ended , including the related notes  (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”).     In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial  position of the Department as of April 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash  flows for the years then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued  by the International Accounting Standards Board.     Basis for Opinion     We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of  America (US GAAS) and in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our  responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibil ities for the Audit  of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of the International  Monetary Fund, and have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant  ethical requirements relatin g to our audit,  which include relevant ethical requirements in the United  States of America and the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for  Professional Accountants . We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and  appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.     Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial  Statements     Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the fina ncial statements in  accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting  Standards Board, and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the  preparation and fair presenta tion of financial statements that are free from material misstatement,  whether due to fraud or error.     In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Department’s ability to  continue as a going concern for at least, but not limited to, twelve months from the end of the reporting  period , disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of  accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Department or to cease operati ons, or has  no realistic alternative but to do so.           Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Department’s financial reporting  process.     Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements       Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are  free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that  includes our opinion . Reasonable assurance is a high l evel of assurance but is not absolute assurance and  therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with US GAAS and ISAs  will always  detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement result ing  from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional  omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material  if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment  made by a reasonable user based on the financial statements.     In performing an audit in accordance with US GAAS and ISAs we:    ● Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.   ● Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to  fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such  procedures include exam ining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in  the financial statements.   ● Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit  procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for  the purpose of expressing an  opinion on the effectiveness of the Department’s internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is  expressed.    ● Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant  accounting estimate s made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the  financial statements.   ● Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate,  that raise substantial doubt about the Department’s ability to c ontinue as a going concern for a  reasonable period of time.     We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the  planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal contr ol-related  matters that we identified during the audit.    Supplemental Information     Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the financial statements taken as a  whole. The accompanying supplemental schedules appearing on pages 40 to 48 as of April 30, 2022 and  for the years ended April 30, 2022 and 2021 (collectively referred to as the “supplemental schedules”) are  presented for purposes of additional analysis and are not a required part of the financial statements. The  supplemental s chedules are the responsibility of management and were derived from and relate directly to  the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the financial statements. The information  has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the au dit of the financial statements and certain  additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying  accounting and other records used to prepare the financial statements or to the financial statements     themselv es and other additional procedures, in accordance with US GAAS. We also subjected the  information to the applicable procedures required by ISAs. In our opinion, the supplemental schedules are  fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the fina ncial statements taken as a whole.         June 24, 2022       I.

Nature of operations  The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is an international  organization with 190 member countries. The IMF’s  fundamental mission is to en sure the stability of the  international monetary system. It does so in three ways:  surveillance of the global economy and the economies of  member countries; lending to  countries with balance of  payments difficulties; and giving practical help by providing technical assistance to members. It is headquartered in Washington, DC, USA.   The IMF conducts its operations and transactions through the  General Department. The General Department comprises three accounts: (i) the General  Resources Account (GRA);  (ii) the Investment Account (IA); and (iii) the Special Disbursement Account (SDA).  1.1  General Resources Account  The financial operations of the IMF with its members are  primarily conducted through the GRA. The assets and liabilities in the GRA reflect the payment of member quota  subscriptions, use and repayment of GRA credit, borrowings  and repayments to lenders, collection of charges from borrowers, payment of remuneration on creditor positions  and interest to lenders, and other operations.  A core responsibility of the IMF is to provide financial  assistance to member countries experiencing actual or  potential balance of payments pr oblems. Upon the request of  a member country, GRA resources are made available either  under a financing arrangement or in the form of outright  purchases (disbursements). An arrangement is a decision by  the IMF’s Executive Board (Executive Board) that gives a  member the assurance that the IMF stands ready to provide  resources to the member during a specified period and up to a specified amount, in accordance with the terms of the  relevant financing instrument.   The Stand-By Arrangement (SBA)  is designed for members  with balance of payments problems expected to be resolved  in the short to medium term. The Extended Fund Facility  (EFF) is a special facility in the GRA for members with longer-term balance of payments problems, the resolution of  which would require structural and more comprehensive  economic reforms. Resources under the SBA and the EFF are made available in phased installments as the member  implements economic policies and measures specified under the arrangement, subject to periodic reviews by the  Executive Board.  The Flexible Credit Line (FCL) is available for members with  very strong fundamentals, policies, and track records of  policy implementation and is intended for both crisis prevention and resolution. The Short-term Liquidity Line  (SLL) is designed to provide liquidity support and has several  innovative features, including revolving access. It has the  same qualification criteria as the FCL but is available only for  members facing potential moderate short-term balance of  payments needs arising due to capital account pressures.  The Precautionary and Liquidity Line (PLL) is available for  members with sound economic fundamentals but with some remaining vulnerabilities that pr eclude them from meeting the  qualification criteria for the FCL and the SLL.   The financing instrument for outright purchases is the Rapid  Financing Instrument (RFI), which is used by members facing  an urgent balance of payments need without the necessity or  capacity for a full-fledged program.  1.2  Investment Account  The IA holds resources transferred from the GRA, which are  invested to broaden the IMF’s income base. The Rules and Regulations of the IA adopted  by the Executive Board  provide the framework for the implementation of the expanded investment authorit y authorized under the Fifth  Amendment of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, which  became effective in February 2011. The IA comprises two  subaccounts: the Fixed-Income Subaccount and the Endowment Subaccount.   The Fixed-Income Subaccount holds resources transferred  from the GRA that are not relat ed to profits from gold sales.  With a view to generating income while protecting the IMF’s  balance sheet, the investment objective of the Fixed-Income  Subaccount is to produce returns in Special Drawing Rights  (SDRs) terms in excess of the th ree-month SDR interest rate  (see Notes 2.1 and 2.2) over time while minimizing the  frequency and extent of negative returns and  underperformance over an investment horizon of three to  four years. During financial year ended April 30, 2022, the  Executive Board concluded its 5- yearly review of the Fixed- Income Subaccount’s investment strategy and effective January 12, 2022, set the investment objective to achieve, over time, returns that exceed  the SDR interest rate by a  margin of 50 basis points. I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021    12 The Endowment Subaccount was credited with  SDR 4.4 billion in profits fr om gold sales during financial  years 2010 and 2011. The Endowment Subaccount’s investment objective is to achieve a real return of 3 percent in US dollar terms over the long term to contribute to covering  the IMF’s administrative expenditures, while preserving the  long-term real value of these assets.   1.3  Special Disbursement Account  The SDA is the vehicle used to receive profits from the sale of gold held by the IMF at  the time of the Second  Amendment of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement (April 1978).  SDA resources can be used for various purposes, as  specified in the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, including transfers to the GRA for immediate use in operations and  transactions, transfers to the IA, or operations and  transactions that are not authorize d by other provisions of the  IMF’s Articles of Agreement but are consis tent with the  mandate of the IMF, in particular to provide balance of payments assistance on special terms to low-income  member countries.  1.4  Other entities administered by the IMF  The IMF also administers the Special Drawing Rights  Department (SDR Department ), trusts (Concessional  Lending and Debt Relief Trusts), and special purpose accounts (Administered Accounts) established to fund financial and technical services consistent with the IMF’s  purposes. As the General Department does not have control  over these entities, their finan cial statements are presented  separately.  The resources of the SDR Department are held separately  from the assets of all t he other accounts owned or  administered by the IMF. As specified in the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, these resources may not be used to meet the liabilities, obligations, or losses incurred in the operations of  the General Department (or vice versa), except that  expenses of conducting the business of the SDR Department are paid by the General De partment and are then reimbursed  by the SDR Department.   The resources of the trusts and special purpose accounts are  contributed by members, by other  financial institutions, or by  the IMF through the SDA. The a ssets and liabilities of the  trusts and special purpose accounts are separate from the assets and liabilities of the General Department. The assets  of the trusts and special purpose accounts cannot be used to  meet the liabilities, obligations, or losses incurred in the  operations of the General  Department. The General  Department can be reimbursed for the expenses incurred in  conducting the business of certain trusts and accounts in  accordance with the IMF’s Articles of Agreement and  relevant decisions of the Executive Board. 1.5  Impact of geopolitical and global economic  developments  The COVID-19 pandemic has cr eated severe disruptions in  global economic activity. The IMF responded to the crisis  with unprecedented speed and  magnitude of financial  assistance, to help countries, notably to protect the most vulnerable and set the stage for economic recovery. A significant number of countri es benefited from emergency  financing through RFI purchases during the financial year ended April 30, 2021 (see Note 5.1). The IMF has also approved financial assistance under its lending arrangements  and augmented existing lending arrangements to  accommodate new needs arising from the impact of the pandemic during the financial years ended April 30, 2022,  and 2021 (see Schedule 3). As a result of this increased  financing activity, the General Department’s credit exposure has increased compared with the pre-pandemic level.  The evolution of the pandemic is  still subject to significant  uncertainty. Beyond April 30, 2022, slowing global growth  and elevated debt vulnerabilities could lead to further  demand for lending arrangements in the coming months. The war in Ukraine that started in February 2022 is expected to  have a significant negative effect on global growth through  commodity markets, trade, and, to a lesser extent, financial interlinkages. Economic and financial spillovers from the war  could also trigger additional demand for Fund financing.   The General Department continues to manage its risks in  accordance with its existing risk management framework  (see Note 4). As of the date of  these financial statements,  there had been no negative impact on the operational results of the General Department, in cluding from the impairment  analysis of its credit portfolio (see Note 5.1). See also Note  2.3 for the most significant estimates and judgements used in  the preparation of thes e financial statements.  The risk management practices described in Note 4.3 have  effectively mitigated the risk exposure of the effects of the  global developments on the investment portfolios. The  valuations of mark-to-market  financial instruments had fully  and rapidly recovered after a brief decline in value at the  onset of the pandemic. However,  in light of the war in  Ukraine, tightening monetary c onditions coupled with a sharp  increase in inflation and inflat ion expectations, the investment  portfolios remain subject to challenging market conditions  and high volatility. The effects of the global developments on  investments are also reflected in the value at risk (VaR) (see  Note 4.3.2.3). The valuation of  investments held at amortized  cost was not impacted. I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021     13 2.  Basis of preparation and measurement  The financial statements of t he General Department are  prepared in accordance with International Financial  Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International  Accounting Standards B oard (IASB). The financial  statements have been prepared under the historical cost  convention, except for the revalu ation of financial instruments  at fair value through profit or  loss. The financial statements  have also been prepared on t he basis that the General  Department will continue to op erate as a going concern.  2.1  Unit of account  The financial statements are presented in SDRs, which is the  IMF’s unit of account. The value of the SDR is determined  daily by the IMF by summing specific amounts of the basket  currencies in US dollar equivalents on the basis of market exchange rates. The IMF generally reviews the composition  of the SDR valuation basket at  five-year intervals. These  reviews cover the currencies to be included in the SDR valuation basket (along with the criteria for the selection of  currencies), determine the relative weights of those  currencies, and assess the fi nancial instruments that are  used to calculate the SDR interest rate. The current basket consists of five currencies. The weights and amounts of the  currencies in the basket, at April 30, 2022, and April 30,  2021, relative to 1 SDR, were as follows:  SDR basket curren cy Weight (in percent) Amount  Chinese renminbi 10.92 1.0174  Euro 30.93 0.38671  Japanese yen 8.33 11.900  Pound sterling 8.09 0.085946  US dollar  41.73 0.58252    At April 30, 2022, SDR 1 was equal to US$1.34430  (US$1.43599 at April 30, 2021).  The current SDR valuation basket was originally scheduled  to expire on September 30, 2021. However, the Executive  Board decided to extend it to July 31, 2022.  On May 11, 2022, the Exec utive Board concluded the  quinquennial review of the me thod of valuation of the SDR  and agreed to maintain the curr ent composition of the SDR  currency and interest rate baskets and approved their  updated weights. The updated basket implies slightly higher weights for the US dollar and the Chinese renminbi and,  accordingly, somewhat lower we ights for the British pound,  the euro, and the Japanese yen.   Effective August 1, 2022, t he SDR basket valuation basket  will be assigned the following weights:  SDR basket currency Weight (in percent)  Chinese renminbi 12.28  Euro 29.31  Japanese yen 7.59  Pound sterling 7.44  US dollar  43.38    The amounts of each of the five  currencies will be calculated  on July 29, 2022 (the transition date) in accordance with the  new weights. The next review of the method of valuation of  the SDR will take place in 2027, unless developments in the  interim justify an earlier review.   2.2  SDR interest rate  The SDR interest rate provides the basis for basic charges  levied on credit outstanding (see Note 17), interest on SDR  holdings (see Note 6), remuneration paid on members’  reserve tranche positions (see Note 18), and interest on  borrowings (see Note 14).   The SDR interest rate is determined weekly by reference to a  weighted average of yields or rates on short-term instruments  in the money markets of the members whose currencies are  included in the SDR valuation basket:   SDR basket currency Yield or rate  Chinese renminbi Three-month benchmark yield for China  Treasury bonds as published by the China  Central Depository and Clearing Co., Ltd.  Euro Three-month spot rate for euro area central  government bonds with a minimum rating of  AA published by the European Central  Bank  Japanese yen Three-month Treasury discount bills  Pound sterling Three-month Treasury bills  US dollar Three-month Treasury bills    The SDR interest rate is subject to a floor of 0.050 percent  and is rounded to three decimal places.   The average SDR interest rate was 0.107 percent per annum  and 0.077 percent per annum during the financial years  ended April 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively.  2.3  Use of estimates and judgement  The preparation of financ ial statements requires  management to make judgements, estimates, and assumptions that affect the app lication of accounting policies  and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.  Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an  ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021    14 recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised  and in any future periods affected.  The most significant estimates and judgements used in  applying accounting policies include expected credit losses measurement for credit outstanding and undrawn  commitments (see Notes 3.2.1.1 and 5.1), fair value  measurement of financial inst ruments (see Notes 3.10 and  8), and actuarial assumptions used in calculating the net assets/liabilities under retirement benefit plans (see Note 11.3).  3.  Summary of significant accounting policies  3.1  Financial instruments   Financial instruments include financial assets and financial liabilities described in Notes 3.2 and 3.7.  Measurement at initial recognition  Financial instruments are recognized when the General Department becomes a party to the contractual provisions of  the instrument. The General Department uses settlement  date accounting for all financial instruments except for  investments, which are accounted for using trade date  accounting (see Note 3.2.3). At initial recognition, a financial instrument is measured at it s fair value, which is best  evidenced by the transaction amount.   Derecognition Financial assets, or a portion thereof, are derecognized when  the contractual rights to rece ive the cash flows from the  assets have expired, or when they have been transferred and  either: (i) the General Department  transfers substantially all  the risks and rewards of owners hip; or (ii) the General  Department neither transfers nor retains substantially all the  risks and rewards of ownership but the General Department  has not retained control.   Financial liabilities are derecognized when they are  extinguished (i.e., when the obligation is discharged,  canceled, or expires).   Classification and subsequent measurement of  financial assets  A financial asset is classified on initial recognition based on two factors: the business model for managing the financial  asset and its contractual cash flow characteristics.   Financial assets that are held for collection of contractual  cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and intere st are measured at amortized  cost (AC). Interest income fr om these financial assets is  included in the statements of  income using the effective interest method. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is  recognized in the statements of income.   Financial assets that are held for collection of contractual  cash flows and for selling, where the assets’ cash flows  represent solely payments of principal and interest, would be  measured at fair value through other comprehensive income  (FVOCI). The General Departm ent did not have financial  assets at FVOCI during the financial years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021.  All other financial assets that do not meet the criteria to be  measured at AC or FVOCI are measured at fair value, with  changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss (FVPL).  Impairment  At each reporting date, the General Department assesses on  a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses (ECL)  associated with its financial assets at AC and with the  undrawn balances under its lending commitments. The  measurement of ECL reflects: (i) an unbiased and probability-weighted amou nt that is determined by evaluating  a range of possible outcomes; (ii) the time value of money; and (iii) reasonable and suppor table information that is  available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date about past events, current conditions, and forecasts of future economic conditions.   If the General Department neede d to recognize ECL, they  would be recorded as impairment allowances for assets at AC and as a liability provision for undrawn commitments.   Should any financial asset become credit-impaired, interest  income would be calculated for it by applying the effective interest rate to its amortized co st (i.e., net of the impairment  allowance).  Classification and subsequent measurement of  financial liabilities  Derivative financial liabilities are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss.   All other financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost. Interest expense from these financial liabilities is included in the statements of income using t he effective interest method.   3.2  Financial assets  3.2.1  Currencies  Currencies are financial assets that consist of members’  currencies held by the GRA with designated depositories, in  the form of account balances or non-interest-bearing  promissory notes that ar e encashable by the GRA on  demand. All currencies in the GRA are classified at AC. I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021     15  Usable currencies are currencies of members considered  to be in a sufficiently strong external position that they can  be used to finance GRA transactions with other members.    Currencies of members that are not considered to have a  sufficiently strong balance of payments and reserves  position to finance GRA transactions with other members are presented as other currencies.    Holdings of member currencies that represent purchases of usable currencies or SDRs in exchange for their own  currencies are presented as credit outstanding (see Note  3.2.1.1).   The currency balances in the statements of financial position include receivables and payables arising from currency  revaluations (see Note 5).  3.2.1.1  Credit outstanding and charges  Credit outstanding is a financial asset that represents  financing provided to members under the various GRA financing facilities (see Note 1.1). Members receive financing  in the GRA by purchasing SDRs or usable currencies in  exchange for their own currencies. GRA credit is repaid by  members by repurchasing holdings of their currencies in  exchange for SDRs or usable currencies.   Charges and fees  The GRA earns interest, referred to as basic charges, on  members’ use of GRA credit (see Note 17). Basic charges are recognized using the e ffective interest method.    In addition to basic charges, outstanding GRA credit is also subject to level-based and time-based surcharges (see Note 17). Surcharges are recognized when the relevant  level-based and time-based thresholds on credit outstanding  set by the Executive Board are reached.   Charges not received from members within the required  timeframe are recovered by the GRA under the burden- sharing mechanism, through adjustments to increase the rate  of charge for debtor member s and decrease the rate of  remuneration on members’ reserve tranche positions (see  Note 13.1).   A service charge is levied by the GRA on all purchases from  the GRA except reserve tranche purchases. Service charges are paid when the purchases are made and are recognized  as income upon payment.   A commitment fee is levied on the amount available for  financing under an arrangement for each 12-month period of  the arrangement. Except for SLL arrangements, commitment  fees are refunded as the member makes purchases under  the relevant arrangement. A prorated commitment fee is also  refunded for all arrangements in case of an arrangement’s cancellation. At the arrangement’s expiration or cancellation, any unrefunded amount is recognized as income. Pending refund or recognition as income, commitment fees are  recognized as part of other li abilities in the statements of  financial position. For SLL arrangements, the commitment  fee is nonrefundable upon purchases. Accordingly,  commitment fee income is recognized on a straight-line basis  over the duration of the SLL arrangement.  Impairment of credit outstanding The General Department’s assessment for impairment of its credit outstanding is grounded in  the context of the nature of  the IMF’s financing and its un ique institutional status:     The IMF has a unique relationship with its member countries, all of which are shar eholders in the institution.    IMF financing under arrangements is linked to regular reviews of performance under a program of economic  policies that the member commits to in order to overcome  balance of payments problems, return to external viability, and repay the IMF.    The IMF employs a comprehensive set of measures to mitigate credit risk (see Note 4.2.1).   The IMF also has de facto pref erred creditor status, which  has been recognized by the official community and generally accepted by private creditors.  Taken together, these factor s significantly reduce the  likelihood of the General Department incurring credit losses.   The General Department has not recognized any impairment  losses since inception. Also, unlik e large financial institutions  in the private sector, the General Department’s credit portfolio consists of a relatively small number of exposures to  its member countries, with eac h member’s circumstances  varying. Therefore, a stat istical approach to credit risk  assessment, such as probability of default (PD) and loss given default (LGD) modeling, as typically followed in the financial sector is neither feasible nor appropriate for the  General Department.   Similarly, the assessment of t he General Department’s credit  risk cannot rely on external credit risk ratings. Due to its  unique characteristics, the IMF’ s credit risk exposure is not  comparable to sovereign credit risk faced by commercial  financial entities and, as a cooperative member organization,  the IMF does not produce its own internal credit rating  grades. Accordingly, credit risk for the General Department is  assessed holistically based on  qualitative an d quantitative  considerations pertaining to each debtor member, such as  the status of the economic programs underlying IMF  financing, the member’s cooperation on policy  implementation and timely settlement of IMF financial obligations, and forward-looking assessment of the member’s  capacity to repay. I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021    16 The General Department has developed a model for ECL  estimation based on changes in credit quality since initial  recognition, where credit qualit y is referred to as Stage 1,  Stage 2, and Stage 3. Credit out standing for which credit risk  has increased significantly since initial recognition (Stage 2), or that is credit-impaired (S tage 3), has its ECL measured on  a lifetime basis. Credit outstan ding for which there has been  no significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition  (Stage 1) has its ECL measured as a portion of lifetime ECL  that result from default events possible within the next  12 months.  The key judgements and assumptions adopted by the  General Department in t he measurement of ECL are  discussed below :  (i) Definition of defaul t and credit-impaired   The General Department considers a member country to be  in default when it is six months or more overdue in settling its  financial obligations to the General Department. This rebuts the presumption that  default occurs no later than 90 days  past due, reflecting the nature of the IMF’s financing and its unique institutional status as well as consistency with the  threshold for internal risk management purposes. Credit outstanding is considered cred it-impaired when the obligation  has defaulted.   (ii) Significant increase in credit risk  The General Department assesses whether a significant increase in credit risk has occurred on a member-by-member  basis by comparing the risk of default at the reporting date  with the risk of default at t he date of the most recent  disbursement to the debtor member. The assessment is  performed on each reporting date and takes into account a  range of qualitative and quantitative criteria, including  overdue obligations to the IMF, signals of noncooperation by  the member, and forward-looking indicators of capacity to repay the IMF. The criteria used to identify significant  increases in credit risk are monitored and reviewed for  appropriateness at least annually.   The assessment does not rely on any single factor and may,  on the basis of other relevant considerations, rebut the  presumption that credit risk has increased significantly when contractual payments are mo re than 30 days past due.  During the financial years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021, the General Department did not have any member more than 30 days past due, except for one member in protracted  arrears at April 30, 2021, which were subsequently settled  (see Note 5.2).  (iii) Low credit risk   The General Department assumes that the credit risk of a member country has not increased significantly since initial recognition if the member is determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date, as defined below.   Credit risk related to the General Department’s exposure to a member country is considered low if: (i) it has a low risk of default; (ii) the member country  has a strong capacity to meet  its contractual cash flow obligations in the near term; and (iii) adverse changes in economic and business conditions in  the longer term may, but will not necessarily, reduce the  ability of the member country to fulfill its contractual cash flow  obligations.   (iv) Measuring ECL  ECL are determined by comparing expected cash flows with contractual cash flows and discounting the expected cash  shortfalls at the effective interest  rate, which is the basic rate  of charge. ECL are estima ted by assessing a range of  possible outcomes in light of expected future economic  conditions, weighted according to the assessed probability of  each outcome. This entails considerable judgement and uncertainty about the estimates.   For the purpose of ECL measurement, financial safeguards that are integral to the IMF’s financial structure and  operations are also considered, such as the burden-sharing  mechanism to compensa te the IMF for loss of income due to  overdue payments (see Note  13.1) and the Special  Contingent Account (SCA-1) to pr otect the IMF in case of the  ultimate failure of a member to repay its overdue obligations to the GRA (see Note 13.2).  Write-off  In the unlikely event that a member with credit outstanding (i) withdraws from the IMF; ( ii) repudiates its outstanding  obligations to the General Depar tment; and (iii) there are no  prospects of recovering amounts due to the General  Department in the foreseeable future, the IMF would  recognize the ultimate loss and the withdrawn member’s credit outstanding to the G eneral Department would be  written off.   3.2.2  SDR holdings   SDR holdings represent SDRs held by the GRA (see Note 6).  SDR holdings are measured at AC.  Interest on SDR holdings is recognized using the effective  interest method.   3.2.3  Investments   Investments are financial assets that include equity securities, real estate investment trusts (REITs), private  infrastructure debt, fixed-in come securities, short-term  investments, fixed-term deposits, and derivative assets. Derivative liabilities are disclosed as part of other liabilities in  the statements of fi nancial position.  I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021     17 Investments in each of the tw o subaccounts are managed in  accordance with their respective investment strategy (see  Note 7) and their performance is evaluated on a fair value  basis. The business model for the invested portfolios focuses on achieving fair value gains. Accordingly, these securities  are classified at FVPL. Funds pending suitable investment in  accordance with the investment  strategy may be kept in  fixed-term deposits, which are measured at amortized cost.  Purchases and sales of investments are recognized on the  trade date. The corresponding investment trades receivable  or payable are recognized in other assets and other liabilities,  respectively, pending settlement of a transaction.  Investment income compri ses interest income on  investments at AC, interest and dividend income, and  realized and unrealized gains and losses from FVPL investments, including currency valuation differences arising  from exchange rate movements against the SDR, net of all  trading-related fees.  Interest income from investments is recognized using the  effective interest method. Dividend income is recognized  based on the ex-dividend date.  3.3  Cash and cash equivalents   Usable currencies and SDR holdings are considered cash and cash equivalents in the statements of cash flows.  3.4  Gold holdings  Gold holdings (acquired prior to the Second Amendment of  the IMF’s Articles of Agreement in April 1978) are carried at  historical cost using the spec ific identification method. The  carrying value is determined by the restrictions on the use of  the IMF’s gold holdings and the di sposition of profits from the  sale of gold. In accordance with the provisions of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, whenever the IMF sells gold that was  held on the date of the e ffectiveness of the Second  Amendment of the IMF’s Articles  of Agreement, that portion  of the proceeds equal to the hist orical cost must be placed in  the GRA. Any proceeds in excess of the historical cost will be held in the SDA or transferred to the Endowment Subaccount  of the IA (see Note 9). The IMF may also sell such gold  holdings to those members that were members on August 1, 1975, in exchange for their currencies and at a price equal to  the historical cost.  3.5  Property, plant and equipment and intangible  assets  Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are  measured at historical cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization. Property, plant and equipment and intangible  assets are capitalized and depreciated or amortized over the  estimated remaining useful lives using the straight-line method. Buildings are deprecia ted over 30 years and other  property, plant and equipment over 3 to 20 years. Leasehold  improvements are depreciated ov er the term of the lease  agreement. Software is amortized over three to five years.  3.6  Post-employment benefits  The IMF sponsors various post-employment benefit plans for its employees, which include defined benefit and other  post-employment benefits such as medical and life insurance  benefits (see Note 11).  The net asset/liability under each retirement benefits plan  recognized in the statements of financial position is the  present value of the defined ben efit obligation less the fair  value of the plan assets. Changes resulting from remeasurements are reported in other comprehensive  income. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined using the projecte d unit credit method by  discounting the estimated future cash outflows using market  yields on high-quality corporate bonds.   Net periodic pension cost includes service cost and net  interest cost on the net asse ts/liabilities under retirement  benefit plans.  3.7  Financial liabilities  3.7.1  Special Contingent Account The SCA-1 was used by the General Department to  accumulate precautionary balances under the burden- sharing mechanism (see Note 13.2) against possible credit  default. Balances in the SCA-1 are akin to refundable non-interest-bearing deposits.   3.7.2  Borrowings   Borrowings are financial liabilities that represent financing  received under the various borrowing arrangements  (see Note 14).  Interest expense on borrowings is calculated by applying the  effective interest method.   3.7.3  Quota subscriptions   Members’ quota subscriptions are financial liabilities that  represent subscription payments by members, including  payments as a result of quota increases (see Note 15.1). An increase in quota subscription for an existing member  becomes effective when the member both consents to the  quota increase and makes the actual payment (provided that any other requirements for the effectiveness of the specific  quota increase are met), and the increase is recorded in the financial statements on the payment  date. Typically, about a  quarter of a member’s quota subscription (reserve asset portion) is paid either in SDRs or in the currencies of other members specified by the IMF, or in any combination of I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021    18 SDRs and such currencies; and the remainder is paid in the  member’s own currency.   Quota subscriptions are cla ssified as liabilities in the  statements of financial position, as they embody an  unconditional repayment obligation in the case of a member’s  withdrawal from the IMF.  3.7.3.1  Reserve tranche positions and remuneration  A member acquires a reserve tranche position in the GRA in  exchange for the reserve asset portion of its quota subscription payment, and from the use of the member’s  currency in the GRA’s transactions or operations (see  Note 15.2).   The GRA pays interest, referr ed to as remuneration, on a  remunerated portion of t he member’s reserve tranche  position (see Note 18). Remuneration expense is recognized  on an accrual basis.   3.8  Provisions  Provisions are recognized when the IMF has a current legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is  probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made. Provisions are measured at  the present value of the amoun ts that are expected to be  paid to settle the obligations.  3.9  Foreign currency translation  Transactions denominated in currencies and not in SDRs are  recorded at the rate of exchange on the date of the  transaction. Assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies are reported using the SDR exchange rate on the  date of the financial statements. Exchange differences  arising from the settlement of transactions at rates different  from those at the originating date of the transactions are  included in the determination of net income.  3.10  Fair value measurement  Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between  market participants at the m easurement date. A fair value  measurement is based on th e presumption that the  transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either in the principal market for the asset or liability or, in the absence of a principal market, in the most  advantageous market.  A three-level fair value hierarchy is used to determine fair  value under which financial instruments are categorized  based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique. The fair value hierarchy has the following levels:  When the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset  or liability fall within multiple le vels of the hierarchy, the level  within which the fair value me asurement is categorized is  based on the lowest-level input t hat is significant to the fair  value measurement of the instrument in its entirety. Thus, a  Level 3 fair value measurement may include inputs that are  both observable and unobservable. Transfers in and out of  the fair value hierarchy levels  are recognized at the end of  the reporting period.  The valuation techniques used to determine fair value are  described in Note 8.  3.11  Amendments to existing standards that became  effective in the financial year ended April 30, 2022  Amendments to IFRS 9, “Financial Instruments”, and IFRS 7,  “Financial Instruments: Disclosures” were issued in August 2020 to address financial reporting issues related to the  reform of an interest rate benchmark, including its  replacement with alternative benchmark rates. The  amendments are effective for annual periods starting on or  after January 1, 2021, and were adopted by the General  Department on May 1, 2021. The amendments had no  material effect on the General Department’s financial  statements.  3.12  Amendments to existing standards effective in  future years  The following amendments to existing standards issued by  the IASB will become effective in  future financial years.   Amendments to IFRS 9, “Financial Instruments” were issued in May 2020 to clarify certain aspects of derecognition of financial liabilities. The amendm ents are effective for annual  periods starting on or after January 1, 2022. The amendments will be adopted by t he General Department for  the financial year ending Ap ril 30, 2023, and are not  expected to have a material effect on the General Department’s financial statements.  Amendments to IAS 1, “Pre sentation of Financial  Statements” and IFRS Prac tice Statement 2, “Making  Materiality Judgements” were issued in February 2021 to  help entities apply materiality judgements to accounting  policy disclosures. The amendments are effective for annual Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical  assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the  measurement date;   Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly  (i.e., derived from prices);  Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021     19 periods starting on or after January 1, 2023. The  amendments will be adopted by t he General Department for  the financial year ending Ap ril 30, 2024, and are not  expected to have a material effect on the General Department’s financial statements.  Amendments to IAS 8, “Accounting Policies, Changes in  Accounting Estimates and Errors” were issued in February  2021 to clarify the definition of accounting estimate. The  amendments are effective for annual periods starting on or  after January 1, 2023. The amendments will be adopted by  the General Department for the financial year ending  April 30, 2024, and are not expected to have a material effect on the General Department’ s financial statements.  4.  Financial risk management   The General Department is exposed to various types of  operational and financial risks, including credit, market, and  liquidity risks.  4.1  Risk management framework  By virtue of its role establishe d through the IMF’s Articles of  Agreement, the IMF faces a range of financial and nonfinancial risks. The Executive Board has approved a risk  acceptance statement guiding risk acceptance and  assessment across the IMF’s activities. The IMF has adopted the three lines of defense model for risk management.   Risks inherent in day-to-day o perations are mitigated by  establishing and main taining a system of internal controls.   A risk management function is responsible for developing  and maintaining the risk management framework, fostering the development of  risk management tools, and  reporting on the General Depart ment’s overall risk profile,  highlighting areas where additional mitigation efforts are needed.    An internal audit function is responsible for providing an independent assessment of  the effectiveness of  governance and internal control processes.    Oversight is provided by committees established to monitor  and make decisions in specific risk areas, which supports the  cycle of risk assessment, ownership, and mitigation vis-à-vis risk acceptance.   4.2  Financial assets and liabilities other than  investments  Financial assets and liabilities other than investments are  exposed to credit, market, and liquidity risks. 4.2.1  Credit risk on financial assets and liabilities other than  investments  Credit risk is the risk of suffering financial losses, should any  of the IMF’s members fail to fulfill their financial obligations to the GRA. Credit risk arises on credit outstanding and  undrawn committed amounts under approved financing  commitments.  Credit risk is inherent in the IMF’s unique role in the  international monetary system  because the IMF has limited  ability to diversify its credit portfolio and generally provides  financing when other sources of credit are not available to a  member. In addition, the IMF’s credit concentration is generally high due to the nature of the financial assistance  provided to its member countries.  Measures to help mitigate the IMF’s credit risk in financing  arrangements include program design and conditionality,  which serve to help member countries solve their balance of  payments problems within the period of an IMF-supported program and to provide the ne eded assurances that the  member will be able to repay the IMF. Other risk mitigating policies include access limits, post financing assessments,  surcharge policies, preventive and remedial measures for  dealing with overdue financial obligations, and the burden- sharing mechanism (see Note 13).   The IMF has established limits on overall access to  resources in the GRA, except for the FCL arrangements that are not subject to any access limits (for limits applicable to  SLL arrangements, see below). The annual limit is normally  set at 145 percent of a member ’s quota, with a cumulative  limit of 435 percent of a mem ber’s quota (net of scheduled  repurchases). In response to the COVID-19 crisis, the annual  limit was temporarily increased to 245 percent of quota  annually for the period from July 13, 2020, through  December 31, 2021.   Access in excess of these limits can be granted in  exceptional circumstances. Except for PLL arrangements,  there is no prespecified maximum on exceptional access to IMF resources, which is assessed on a case-by-case basis in  accordance with the policy framework on exceptional access.  The IMF assesses factors such as the size of balance of  payments needs, the member’s debt sustainability and its  ability to regain access to financing from other sources, the  member’s capacity to repay the Fund, and the strength of  policies to be adopted.   PLL arrangements have a cumulative access limit of  500 percent of quota (net of scheduled repurchases). Access  under a six-month PLL arrangement is subject to a limit of  125 percent of quota. In exceptional circumstances where a member is experiencing or has the potential to experience  larger short-term balance of payments needs due to the I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021    20 impact of exogenous shocks, including heightened regional  or global stress conditions, access under a six-month PLL  arrangement is subject to a higher limit of 250 percent of  quota.  SLL arrangements have revolving access, and multiple  purchases and repurchases may take place during the  course of the arrangement, subj ect to a limit of 145 percent  of quota on the total credit outstanding at any given date under current or any prior SLL arrangements.   Further, in September 2020, the IMF established policy  safeguards when a member requests financing with  combined access to GRA and Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRG Trust) resources in excess of specified  thresholds. These thresholds are set at the same levels that  trigger application of the GRA exceptional access framework.  The safeguards are also broadly aligned with the criteria and  procedures applied in the GRA exceptional access  framework described above. There were no limits on combined access to GRA and PRG Trust resources prior to  September 2020.  The annual limit for RFI purchases is normally set at 50  percent of a member’s quota, with a cumulative limit of 100  percent of a member’s quota ( net of scheduled repurchases).  These limits were temporarily increased to 100 percent of  quota annually and 150 percent of  quota cumulatively (net of  scheduled repurchases) for the period from April 6, 2020,  through June 30, 2023.  Purchases under SBA and EFF arrangements are made in  tranches and are subject to conditionality in the form of performance criteria, indicative targets, structural  benchmarks, and prior actions, as well as regular reviews by  the Executive Board.   In addition, the IMF has adopted a safeguards policy to  mitigate the risk of misuse of resources and a misreporting policy to deal with incorrect reporting of data or performance  against any conditions under an IMF-supported program.  Safeguards assessments of member central banks are undertaken to provide the IMF with reasonable assurance  that the central bank’s legal structure, governance, control,  reporting, and auditing systems are adequate to maintain the integrity of its operations and to manage resources, including  IMF disbursements. When IMF resources are provided as  direct budget financing to the government, the safeguards policy also requires that IMF disbursements be deposited at  the central bank, and that an appropriate framework  agreement between the central bank and the government be  in place to ensure timely servicing of the member’s financial  obligations to the IMF. Further, a fiscal safeguards review of the state treasury is requir ed for cases where a member requests exceptional access, and at least 25 percent of IMF funds are expected to be used fo r direct budget financing.   The maximum credit risk exposure is the carrying value of the IMF’s credit outstanding a nd undrawn commitments.   4.2.1.1  Credit outstanding  Credit outstanding comprised SDR 93,031 million and  SDR 89,788 million at April 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively  (see Note 5). The concentration of GRA outstanding credit by  region was as follows:     The use of credit in the GRA by the largest users was as  follows:    The five largest users of GRA credit at April 30, 2022, and 2021, in descending order, were Argentina, Egypt, Ukraine,  Pakistan, and Ecuador. Credit outstanding by member is  presented in Schedule 1.  In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant number  of countries have benefited from emergency financial  assistance under the RFI (see Note 5.1), including 21  countries with a total disbursed amount of SDR 9,480 million  that did not have credit outst anding from the IMF at March  31, 2020. There is no ex-post program-based conditionality or reviews under the RFI, with overall conditionality limited.  4.2.1.2  Undrawn commitments  Undrawn commitments under GRA arrangements amounted  to SDR 102,614 million and SDR 93,457 million at April 30,  2022, and 2021, respectively. Commitments and undrawn balances under current arrangements are presented in  Schedule 3.   April 30, 2022  April 30, 2021  (in millions of SDRs and as a percentage  of total GRA credit outstanding)   Africa 12,305 13.2% 10,438 11.6%  Asia and Pacific 1,833 2.0% 1,886 2.1%  Europe  8,675 9.3% 9,914 11.0%  Middle East and Central  Asia 24,864 26.7% 24,490 27.3%  Western Hemisphere  45,354 48.8% 43,060 48.0%  Total 93,031 100.0% 89,788 100.0%   April 30, 2022  April 30, 2021   (in millions of SDRs and as a percentage of  total GRA credit outstanding)   Largest user of credit  33,221 35.7% 31,914 35.5%  Three largest users of  credit  54,708 58.8% 52,294 58.2%  Five largest users   of credit  65,001 69.9% 62,067 69.1%  I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021     21 No purchases under RFIs had been approved by the  Executive Board, but not yet disbursed at April 30, 2022  (SDR 630 million at April 30, 2021).   The undrawn commitments under GRA arrangements have  also increased as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic (see  Note 1.5) as the IMF has approved new financial assistance under its lending arrangements (including to four countries  that had not had a lending arrangement with, or credit  outstanding to the IMF at Ma rch 31, 2020) and augmented  existing lending arrangements to accommodate urgent new  needs arising from the impact of the pandemic.  4.2.2  Market risk on financial assets and liabilities other than  investments Market risk is the risk that the fa ir value or future cash flows  of financial instruments will fl uctuate because of changes in  market prices. Market risk for financial assets and liabilities other than investments includes interest rate risk and  exchange rate risk.  4.2.2.1  Interest rate risk  Interest rate risk is the risk t hat future net cash flows will  fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. All interest-bearing financial instru ments other than investments  of the General Department accr ue interest either at the SDR  interest rate or at a rate that is linked to the SDR interest rate  (see Note 2.2). Interest rate risk is primarily managed by  linking the rate of charge directly, by means of a fixed margin, to the cost of financing (which is equal to the SDR  interest rate).   4.2.2.2  Exchange rate risk  Exchange rate risk is the risk that the General Department’s  financial position and cash flows will be affected by  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.    The General Department has no exchange rate risk  exposure on its holdings of members’ currencies in the GRA because members maintain the value of such  holdings in SDR terms (see Note 5).    The General Department has other assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than SDRs and makes  administrative payments largely in US dollars, but the exchange rate risk exposure associated with these  activities is limited.    The General Department has no exchange rate exposure  from its current borrowing arrangements because all  drawings are denominated in SDRs.  4.2.3  Liquidity risk on financial assets and liabilities other than investments  Liquidity risk is the risk to the General Department of  nonavailability of resources to meet the financing needs of  members and its own obligations. The IMF must have usable resources available to meet members’ demand for IMF  financing. While the IMF’s resources are largely of a  revolving nature, uncertainties in the timing and amount of  credit extended to members during financial crises expose the IMF to liquidity risk. Moreover, the IMF must also stand  ready to provide resources for unexpected needs, for  example, to: (i) meet, upon a member’s representation of  need, potential demands for a drawing on the member’s  reserve tranche; and (ii) authorize drawings to meet demands for encashment of creditor claims under the New  Arrangements to Borrow (NAB) or the bilateral borrowing  agreements (see Note 14).  The IMF manages its liquidity risk by closely scrutinizing  developments in its liquidity position. The IMF’s main liquidity  measure—Forward Commitment Capacity -represents the  IMF’s capacity to make new GRA resources available to its  members over the following 12 months (see Schedule 2).   Long-term liquidity needs are addressed by reviewing the  adequacy of quota-based resources. General reviews of  members’ quotas are conducted at regular intervals to  evaluate the adequacy of quot a-based resources to meet  members’ demand for IMF financing. The IMF may also borrow to supplement its quota resources (see Note 14).  Short-term liquidity needs for financing activities are reviewed  and approved by the Executive Board on a periodic basis  through a financial transactions plan for quota resources and  the resource mobilization plan for borrowed resources.   4.2.3.1  Maturity profile of fi nancial assets and liabilities other  than investments  Depending on the type of financing instrument, repurchase  periods for GRA credit vary from 3¼ to 10 years. Scheduled  and overdue repurchases of outstanding GRA credit are  summarized below:      Repayments of outstanding borrowings are determined  according to the schedule of repurchases of credit that was  financed by borrowed resources.

General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021    22 equal to 10 years for all outstanding borrowings. Scheduled  repayments of outstanding borrowings are summarized  below:    Repurchases during the financial years ended April 30, 2022,  and 2021, included advance repurchases of SDR 3,797 million and SDR 3,677 million, respectively.  These advance repurchases resulted in earlier than  scheduled repayments of outstanding borrowings of SDR 1,134 million and SDR 2,094 million, respectively.  Future interest payments on borrowings calculated at the  SDR interest rate at April 30, 2022, represent SDR 10 million for the financial year ending April 30, 2023. Thereafter, a total  of SDR 3 million will be paid th rough the last repayment date.  Usable and other currencies, SDR holdings, and quota subscriptions do not have maturity dates.  4.3  Investments  Investments are exposed to credit, market, and liquidity risks.  4.3.1  Credit risk on investments  Credit risk on investments repr esents the potential loss if  issuers and counterparties were to default on their  contractual obligations.   Credit risk in the IA is minimized by limiting fixed-income  investments to financial instrum ents with a credit rating at the  time of acquisition:   For the Fixed-Income Subaccount, effective January 12,  2022 the minimum credit rating is set at the equivalent of  BBB– (based on Standard & Poor’s long-term rating scale)  for corporate bonds and BBB+ for all other assets (at least A for all assets before January 12, 2022).    For the Endowment Subaccount, the minimum credit rating is set at BBB+ for so vereign bonds and BBB– for  corporate bonds and private infrastructure debt. Limited holdings in the Endowment Subaccount of corporate  bonds and private infrastructure debt rated below BBB–  are permitted under the Rules and Regulations of the  Investment Account.   Exempt from the credit rating requirement are instruments  issued by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS),  which does not have a credit ra ting, central bank deposits,  and short-term instruments.  The carrying amount of the fixed-income instruments represents the maximum exposure to credit risk. The credit  risk exposure for fixed-income instruments in the IA, at the  end of the respective reporting periods, was as follows:   Fixed-Income Subaccount    April 30, 2022 April 30, 2021  (as a percentage of total investments in  fixed-income instruments)   Not rated (BIS) — 0.0% 2,557 15.6%  AAA  5,422 29.3% 5,918 36.2%  AA+ to AA–  7,075 38.3% 3,435 21.0%  A+ to A  5,741 31.1% 4,305 26.4%  BBB+ 240 1.3% 125 0.8%  Total  18,478 100.0% 16,340 100.0%      Counterparty risk for derivative instruments is mitigated by strict exposure limits, cr edit rating requirements, and  collateral requirements. The ma ximum exposure to credit risk  for derivative instruments is the amount of any unrealized  gains on such contracts.   The credit risk exposure for derivative instruments in the  Fixed-Income Subaccount amounted to SDR 106 million and  SDR 38 million at April 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The  credit risk exposure for derivative instruments in the Endowment Subaccount amounted to SDR 58 million and  SDR 5 million at April 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively.  4.3.2  Market risk on investments  Market risk is the risk that the fa ir value or future cash flows  of financial instruments will fl uctuate because of changes in  market prices. Market risk for investments incl udes interest  rate risk, exchange rate risk, and other price risks.  The investment objectives of the Fixed-Income and  Endowment Subaccounts differ, and the investment  strategies, including asset allocation and risk tolerance, are  tailored for each of the subacc ounts, thereby exposing them  to different types of market risk.

General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021     23 4.3.2.1  Fixed-Income Subaccount  The Fixed-Income Subaccount holds debt obligations of a  broad range of issuers within limits defined by the Rules and  Regulations of the IA (see Note 7.1 for the eligible investments). Market risk is mitigated through asset class  diversification and within asset classes through broad security selection.   The Fixed-Income Subaccount authorizes the use of  derivative instruments for managing interest rate risk, currency hedging, or reducing co sts in the context of portfolio  balancing, benchmark replication, and market access. Safeguards are in place against short selling and financial leverage.  Exchange rate risk is mitigated by hedging investments  denominated in non-SDR currencies into SDR basket currencies with the objective of preserving the Fixed-Income  Subaccount’s SDR basket composition.  4.3.2.2  Endowment Subaccount   Investments are divided into eight categories, which are  subject to varying market risks and benefits from  diversification properties (see  Note 7.2 for the eligible  investments). Market risk is mitigated through asset class  diversification and within asset classes through broad security selection.   Effective January 12, 2022, except for the allocation to  emerging market equities, which may be managed actively, all Endowment Subaccount assets shall be managed  passively (prior to January 12, 2022, the Endowment  Subaccount was split into the passively-managed portfolio managed in accordance with the strategic asset allocation  and the actively-managed portfolio, which could comprise up  to 10 percent of the Endowment assets, invested in the same  asset categories with target  shares for fixed-income  instruments and equities with out specific allocation  requirements within those shares).   The Endowment Subaccount authorizes the use of derivative  instruments for managing interest rate risk, currency hedging, or reducing costs in the cont ext of portfolio balancing,  benchmark replication, and market access.   Because the IMF’s administrative expenditures are largely in  US dollars and the Endowment Subaccount’s general  objective is to contribute to  covering such expenditures (see  Note 1.2), the performance of the Endowment Subaccount is  measured in US dollars as the base currency but translated into SDRs for financial reporting. The Rules and Regulations  of the IA provide for hedging against the exchange rate risk  for fixed-income instruments denominated in developed  market currencies vis-à-vis the US dollar. The valuation changes from exchange rate fluctuations are included in the determination of investment income.   4.3.2.3  Value at risk  Exposures to market risk, including interest rate, exchange rate, and other price risks, are measured using VaR, which  considers known market risks in each of the asset categories  and the effect of asset class diversification. VaR estimates  reported below represent the maximum potential loss in  value of the assets over the ne xt year due to adverse market  movements with a 95 percent c onfidence level. There is a  1 in 20 chance that annual losses on investment assets are equal to or exceed the reported VaR. Losses in a single year could exceed the reported VaR by a significant amount.  The VaR model is based on historical simulations with a  three-year look back period and monthly overlapping risk factor returns for each individual instrument in the portfolios  to produce plausible future scenarios based on these  simulations. In each simulation scenario, risk factor data on the valuation date is shocked according to past observations  and each instrument is repriced, resulting in a hypothetical  empirical distribution of re turns. There is no standard  methodology for estimating VaR, and the modeling of the market risk characteristics of the investments involves many  assumptions and some limited pr oxy or substitutes. Different  assumptions or methodologies would produce significantly different VaR estimates.   The VaR for the Fixed-Income Subaccount portfolio was as  follows:   April 30, 2022 April 30, 2021   (in millions of SDRs )  Tranche 1 (see Note 7) 169 65  Tranche 2 (see Note 7) 107 58  Diversification effects (26) (47)  Total Fixed-Income Subaccount 250 76   I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021    24 The VaR for the Endowment Subaccount portfolio was as  follows:   April 30, 2022 April 30, 2021   (in millions of SDRs )  Passively managed portfolio:   Developed market equities 397 493  Emerging market equities 182 203  Global Sovereign bonds 66 —  Developed market sovereign bonds n/a1 65  Developed market corporate bonds 60 51  Emerging market bonds n/a1 17  US Treasury Inflation-Protected        Securities 68 52  Real estate investment trusts 175 97  Private infrastructure debt 17 5  Infrastructure equities 55 —  Diversification effects (296) (236)  Total for passively managed  portfolio 724 747  Actively managed portfolio:    Fixed-income securities — 10  Equity securities — 39  Diversification effects — (11)  Total for actively managed portfolio — 38  1 Following the changes to the investment  strategy approved by the Executive  Board on January 12, 2022, the investment categories of developed market  sovereign bonds and emerging market bonds were restructured into the global sovereign bonds category.     4.3.3  Liquidity risk on investments  Liquidity risk on investments refers to the risk that an investment will not have an active buyer or seller when  traded, which could negatively affect the price of the  investment.  The IA’s liquidity needs are low and the liquidity risk is  minimal because both subaccounts hold the majority of their resources in readily marketable short-term investments. 4.3.3.1  Maturity profile of investments The maturities of the fixed-income securities and derivatives  in the Fixed-Income Subaccount were as follows:     April 30, 2022 April 30, 2021  Financial year  (in millions of SDRs)   2022  — 6,909  2023 5,659 3,131  2024 5,294 2,179  2025  3,346 1,554  2026 2,110 1,254  2027 1,535 425  2028 and beyond 891 1,154  Total 18,835 16,606   The maturities of the fixed-income securities and derivatives  in the Endowment Subaccount were as follows:   April 30, 2022 April 30, 2021  Financial year  (in millions of SDRs)   2022  — 392  2023 496 376  2024 344 396  2025  388 455  2026 390 461  2027 361 303  2028 and beyond 1,331 1,346  Total 3,310 3,729    Investments in both subaccounts largely represent liquid  investments, which could be sold earlier than their maturity,  whenever necessary.  4.4  Post-employment benefit plans  The General Department is exposed to investment, liquidity, and longevity risks associated wit h post-employment benefit  plans (the Plans). These risks are balanced a gainst the need  to meet the financial obligations of each plan. The Plans have adopted general guidelines on permissible investments and plan assets are invested a ccording to a strategic asset  allocation, which is expected to generate a rate of return at or in excess of the rate of growth in the Plans’ liabilities. The strategic asset allocation is reviewed periodically by the  Investment Committee. The strategic asset allocation is  designed to minimize the level of portfolio market risk  (volatility) for the targeted rate of return, while better aligning  portfolio volatility with the potential volatility of the Plans’  liabilities. Through a global, multiple-asset-class investment  approach, the portfolio risk is r educed for any targeted rate of  return, because asset class returns are not perfectly  correlated as regional and global economic, financial, and political events unfold. The Pl ans do not utilize specific,  targeted asset-liability matching  instruments or strategies I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021     25 such as annuities, longevity swaps, cash flow matching, or  duration matching.  The primary objective with respect to liquidity is to have  sufficient liquid resources available to pay benefits when due. This risk is monitored to ensure that payments due to the  participants and beneficiaries can be met from the holdings  of cash and highly liquid investments of the Plans.  4.5  Precautionary balances  Precautionary balances consist of the GRA reserves (excluding that portion repres enting the profits from the  2009–10 gold sales that have been earmarked for the  Endowment Subaccount), and t he balance in the SCA-1.  They are a key element of the Fund’s multilayered risk  management framework as they provide a buffer to protect  the Fund against unexpected losses resulting from credit,  income, and other financial risks. The Executive Board conducted an interim review of the adequacy of  precautionary balances in December 2021, ahead of the  standard two-year cycle given the need for close monitoring  due to the heightened uncertainty in the global economy  linked to the pandemic and the path and timing of the recovery. In concluding the interim review, the Executive  Board kept the medium-term indicative target and minimum  floor for precautionary balances at SDR 25 billion and SDR 15 billion, respectively (the medium-term indicative  target had been raised from SDR 20 billion to SDR 25 billion  during the previous review of the precautionary balances in November 2020).  During the December 2021 interim review, the Executive  Board approved a new approach for the treatment of retirement benefit plans in th e computation of precautionary  balances. This approach better reflects the role of precautionary balances as a long-term buffer for economic  and financial risks. Under the new approach, referred to as  the ‘economic basis’, the defined benefit liability of the plans  is measured using a discount rate that reflects the  expected  long-term return on plan assets. Any net liability measured under the economic basis is used in calculating precautionary balances in place of the net asset/liability  calculated under IAS 19 (see Note 11). However, any net  asset measured under the economic basis would not be used in calculating precautionary bala nces. The change took effect  from May 1, 2021. A one-time increase of SDR 205 million was made to precautionary ba lances as at that date,  reflecting the accumulated net loss to date, to align with the new measurement methodology.   At April 30, 2022, and 2021, precautionary balances  amounted to SDR 20.9 billion and SDR 20.0 billion,  respectively, and were calculated as follows:   April 30, 2022  April 30, 2021   (in millions of SDRs)  Special Reserve (Note 16)  13,692 11,347  General Reserve (Note 16) 12,832 12,003  Excluding profits from gold sales (4,403) (4,403)  Adjustment for net assets/liabilities under  retirement benefit plans under  IAS 19 (Note 11.2) (1,248) n/a  Adjustment for net liabilities  under retirement benefit plans  under the economic basis —1 n/a   SCA-1 (Note 13.2)   — 1,066  Total precautionary balances 20,873 20,013  1 The measurement of the retirement benefit plans under the economic basis  resulted in a net pension asset at April 30, 2022. As such, further adjustments to  precautionary balances were not required after excluding the net assets/liabilities determined under IAS 19.  5.  Currencies, including credit outstanding  Under the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, members are  required to maintain the value of the GRA’s holdings of their  currencies in terms of the SDR. Any depreciation or  appreciation in a member’s currency vis-à-vis the SDR gives  rise to a currency valuation adjustment receivable or payable that must be settled by the mem ber promptly after the end of  the financial year or at other times as requested by the IMF  or the member. Currency holdi ngs of SDR 454,718 million at  April 30, 2022, included receivables and payables arising  from those valuation adjustm ents of SDR 19,796 million and  SDR 13,073 million, respectively (currency holdings of  SDR 458,656 million at April 30, 2021, included receivables  and payables of SDR 25,618 million and SDR 10,182 million,  respectively).  All holdings of members’ currencies are typically revalued at  the IMF’s financial year-end.   5.1  Credit outstanding  At April 30, 2022, and 2021, members’ use of GRA credit  was represented by currency holdings of SDR 93,031 million  and SDR 89,788 million, respectively. I. General Department Notes to the Financial Statements for the Financial Years Ended April 30, 2022, and 2021    26 Changes in credit outstanding under the various facilities of  the GRA were as follows:  1 Other facilities include legacy credit under Enlarged Access and Supplementary  Financing Facility.    1 Other facilities include legacy credit under Enlarged Access and Supplementary  Financing Facility.    5.1.1  Emergency financial assistance  The tables above reflect emergency financing under the RFI  that was provided by the General Department to members  facing urgent balance of payment s needs as a result of the  economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Credit  outstanding by member is presented in Schedule 1.  Following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the access  limits for RFI purchases were temporarily increased (see  Note 4.2.1).  5.1.2  Impairment analysis  The General Department has performed an impairment  analysis of credit outstanding  in accordance with its ECL  model (see Note 3.2.1.1). Based on this analysis, no loss  allowance was deemed to be necessary at April 30, 2022,  and 2021. As described in Note 3.2.1.1, the impairment analysis of the General Depa rtment’s credit outstanding  takes into account the unique  nature of the IMF’s financing  and its institutional status, and is performed holistically for  each debtor member based on  qualitative an d quantitative  considerations and taking into account relevant current developments, including the geopolitical and global economic developments as described in Note 1.5. In this context, the  results of the impairment ana lysis at April 30, 2022, and  2021, are not materially sensitive to reasonable changes in  input parameters of the ECL calculation.  5.2  Overdue obligations  At April 30, 2022, no member was six months or more overdue in settling its financial obligations to the General  Department (one member—Sudan—was six months or more  overdue in settling its financial obligations to the General Department at April 30, 2021).   On June 29, 2021, Sudan settled all of its overdue  obligations to the General Department, including GRA credit outstanding and overdue char ges of SDR 142 million and  SDR 738 million, respectively . Settlement of the overdue  charges generated burden-sharing refunds to members totaling SDR 611 million that had been previously collected  through burden-sharing adjustments to charges and  remuneration (see Notes 13.1, 13.2, 17, and 18).   6.  SDR holdings  The General Department can receive SDRs from members in  the settlement of their financia l obligations to the GRA and  quota subscription payments. In  addition, the GRA may use  or receive SDRs in transactions and operations with members, including the provision of financial assistance to  members, the receipt of charges and fees, and the payment of remuneration on reserve tranche positions or interest on  borrowings to member countries and lenders.  At April 30, 2022, and 2021, the SDR holdings of the General  Department amounted to SDR 22,270 million and  SDR 22,203 million, respectively.  The GRA earns interest on its SDR holdings at the same rate  as other holders of SDRs. Interest on SDR holdings during  the financial years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021, amounted to SDR 25 million and SDR 17 million,  respectively.  7.

"Provided by   Accounting Financial Statements   The Academic Center for Excellence  1 May 2022   Accounting Financial Statements     In accounting , it is important to be able to compose and interpret financial statements. Being  able to do this will allow investors, accountants, and lenders to determine the financial health of a company. This handout will explain how to prepare each financial statement, including the  income statement, statement of retained earnings, balance sheet, and statement of cash flows.     Important Terms   You can click each term to navigate to specific sections of this handout.   Income statement : This is the first financial statement prepared . The income statement is  prepared to look at a company’s revenues and expenses over a certain period, such as a month,  a quarter, or a year. When expenses are subtracted from revenues, the result is net income .     Statement of retained earnings : This is the second financial statement prepared. This statement  shows how much of a company’s earnings were kept within the company and not paid out via  dividends (the earnings distributed to a company’s shareholders).    Balance sheet : This is the third financial statement prepared. The balance sheet shows a  company’s financial position at any point in time, rather than over a period. To prepare a company’s balance sheet, all that is needed is the company’s assets, liabilities, and equity.    Statement of cash flows : This is the last financial statement prepared. The statement of cash  flows lists the cash inflows and outflows for a company over a period, such as a month, a quarter, or a year.    Income Statement   When doing income statements, it is important to account for all types of revenues and expenses. For example, common types of revenue accounts include sales, com missions, fees  earned, interest revenue, and service revenue. Common types of expense accounts include depreciation expense, salary expense, rent expense, utilities expense, income tax expense, and  interest expense. The reason the income statement is prepared first is because the final  product is net income, which is needed for the statement of retained earnings.        Provided by   Accounting Financial Statements   The Academic Center for Excellence  2 May  2022   Example:   ABC Company  had a total revenue of $55,000 during the fiscal year, ending on December 31st.  Of the company’s total revenue, $50,000 was from service revenue, $4,000 was from sales, and  $1,000 was from fees earned. Also, ABC Company  had $28,000 in total expenses. Of the  expenses, $10,000 came from paying employee salaries, $8,000 came from rent expenses, and  $5,000 came from interest expenses. Furthermore, ABC Company  had $3,000 of income tax  expenses, $1,000 in depreciation expenses, $1,000 of utility expenses. A clas s assignment may  require students to complete an income statement that would look like the following table .    Income Statement  ABC Company    For Fiscal Year Ended  December 31   Revenues       Service revenue  $50,000     Sales      4,000     Fees earned      1,000     Total revenues   $55,000        Expenses       Salary expense  $10,000     Rent expense      8,000     Interest expense      5,000     Income tax expense      3,000     Depreciation expense      1,000     Utilities expense      1,000     Total expenses   $28,000        Net income    $27,000     It should be noted that the net income of $27,000 was calculated by subtracting the total  expenses of $28,000 from the total revenues of $55,000. ABC Company ’s net income will be  used to prepare the next financial statement, which is the statement of retai ned earnings.          Provided by   Accounting Financial Statements   The Academic Center for Excellence  3 May  2022   Statement of Retained Earnings   The reason this is the second statement to prepare is because the retained earnings are needed  to prepare the equity section of the balance sheet. T he first item needed to determine a  company’s  retained earnings for a period is to record the retained earni ngs from the beginning  of the period. Next, add the company’s net income from the income statement to the amount of retained earnings at the beginning of the period. Finally, subtract how much money was paid in dividends to the company’s shareholders.   Example:   The following table shows ABC Company ’s retained earnings as of the end of the fiscal year on  December 31st. It should be noted that ABC Company  started the year with $12,000 in retained  earnings. They also had a net income of $27,000 for year, which  was calculated by preparing  the income statement. Lastly, they paid out $4,000 in dividends to company shareholders  during the fiscal year. A class assignment may require students to complete a statement of retained earnings for ABC Company that would loo k like the following table.     Statement of  Retained Earnings  ABC Company   For Fiscal Year Ended  December 31st    Retained earnings  (January 1st)  $12,000   Add Net income    27,000     $39,000   Subtract  Dividends    4,000    Retained earnings   (December 31st)  $35,000     In this example, ABC Company  started the fiscal year with $12,000. After adding $27,000 to that  amount, the running total is $39,000. Next, $4,000 is subtracted from that to account for  dividend payments. Therefore, ABC Company  ends the year with $35,000 in retained earnings.  The $35,000 in retained earnings will be needed to prepare the equity section of the next  financial statement, the balance sheet.            Provided by   Accounting Financial Statements   The Academic Center for Excellence  4 May  2022   Balance Sheet   The balance sheet is prepared using the accounting equation formula. Therefore, it should be  set up as assets = liabilities + equity. The company’s asset accounts should be recorded on the  left side of the page, while its liabilities and equity accounts should be recorded on the right  side of the page. Assets are any tangible item of value that a company owns. Common examples of assets are cash, accounts receivable, land, equipment, and inventory. Liabilities are debts the company owes to other entities, such as lenders, sellers, and other companies.  Common examples of liabilities are accounts payable, wages payable, notes payable, and taxes  payable. The difference between a company’s assets and liabilities is the company’s equity. Within the equity section of the balance sheet, the company’s retained earnings and common stock are listed. The reason the balance sheet is the third statement prepared is because the  cash account balance in assets is needed for the statement of cash flows. The following table  shows ABC Company’s balance sheet on December 31st.   Example:   On December 31 st, ABC Company  had $75,000 in total assets. Of their assets, they had $50,000  in cash, $20,000 in inventory, and $5,000 in accounts receivable. ABC Company  also had  $27,000 in total l iabilities. Of their liabilities, they had $15,000 in wages payable, $6,000 in  accounts payable, $3,000 in taxes payable, and $3,000 in notes payable. In addition, ABC  Company  had $48,000 in equity. Of their equity, they had $13,000 in common stock and  $35,000 in retained earnings. A class assignment may require students to complete a balance sheet for ABC Company that would look like the following table.     Balance Sheet  ABC Company    December 31st   Assets   Liabilities    Cash  $50,000  Wages payable  $15,000   Inventory    20,000  Accounts payable      6,000   Accounts receivable      5,000  Taxes payable      3,000     Notes payable      3,000     Total liabilities   $27,000          Equity      Common stock  $13,000     Retained earnings    35,000     Total equity  $48,000        Total assets  $75,000  Total liabilities and equity  $75,000    Provided by   Accounting Financial Statements   The Academic Center for Excellence  5 May  2022   In the example above, it should be noted that the value of the total assets equals the value of  the total liabilities and equity combined, which is $75,000 for each. Also, remember that the  retained earnings from the previous statement were used to prepare the equity section of the  balance sheet. To prepare the next statement, which is the statement of cash flows, the cash  account balance in the assets section will be needed. Therefore, the $50,000 in cash will be used to prepare the statement of cash flows.    Statement of Cash Flows   The statement of cash flows is divided into three sections. The first section is the cash flows  from operating activities. Examples of operating activity accounts include wages, salaries,  interest payments, interest income, cash receipts from customers, and c ash paid to vendors.  The second section is the cash flows from investing activities. For example, investing cash flows could be the buying and selling of an asset, such as equipment. The third section is the cash flows from financing activities. Examples o f financing cash flows would be dividends paid to  shareholders, cash investments by investors, bond issuances, and repayment of loans. The sum  of net cash flows from all three activities should equal the cash balance in the cash account  from the balance sheet. Additionally, there are two different methods to prepare the statement of cash flows: the direct method and the indirect method.     The following example shows ABC Company ’s statement of cash flows for the fiscal year that  ended on December 31st. ABC Company  uses the direct method in the following example. It  should be noted that account balances in parentheses indicate a negative balance for that  account.     Example:   At the  beginning of the fiscal year, ABC Company  had $0 in cash. During the year, they  increased that amount by $50,000, to end with $50,000. ABC Company  accumulated a net total  of $52,000 from operating activities.  Even though they received $70,000 cash from c ustomer  receipts, they paid $10,000 to vendors and $8,000 for rent. ABC Company  had a negative  balance of $18,000 for investing activities during the year. Of that $18,000, $12,000 went  toward purchasing vehicles, $4,000 went toward purchasing computer equipment, and $2,000 went toward purchasing furniture. For financing activities, ABC Company  accumulated a net  total of $16,000. Even though they received $26,000 in investments from investors, they still paid $6,000 towards their bank loan, and $4,000 via d ividends toward their shareholders.

"Provided by   Accounting Financial Statements   The Academic Center for Excellence  1 May 2022   Accounting Financial Statements     In accounting , it is important to be able to compose and interpret financial statements. Being  able to do this will allow investors, accountants, and lenders to determine the financial health of a company. This handout will explain how to prepare each financial statement, including the  income statement, statement of retained earnings, balance sheet, and statement of cash flows.     Important Terms   You can click each term to navigate to specific sections of this handout.   Income statement : This is the first financial statement prepared . The income statement is  prepared to look at a company’s revenues and expenses over a certain period, such as a month,  a quarter, or a year. When expenses are subtracted from revenues, the result is net income .     Statement of retained earnings : This is the second financial statement prepared. This statement  shows how much of a company’s earnings were kept within the company and not paid out via  dividends (the earnings distributed to a company’s shareholders).    Balance sheet : This is the third financial statement prepared. The balance sheet shows a  company’s financial position at any point in time, rather than over a period. To prepare a company’s balance sheet, all that is needed is the company’s assets, liabilities, and equity.    Statement of cash flows : This is the last financial statement prepared. The statement of cash  flows lists the cash inflows and outflows for a company over a period, such as a month, a quarter, or a year.    Income Statement   When doing income statements, it is important to account for all types of revenues and expenses. For example, common types of revenue accounts include sales, com missions, fees  earned, interest revenue, and service revenue. Common types of expense accounts include depreciation expense, salary expense, rent expense, utilities expense, income tax expense, and  interest expense. The reason the income statement is prepared first is because the final  product is net income, which is needed for the statement of retained earnings.        Provided by   Accounting Financial Statements   The Academic Center for Excellence  2 May  2022   Example:   ABC Company  had a total revenue of $55,000 during the fiscal year, ending on December 31st.  Of the company’s total revenue, $50,000 was from service revenue, $4,000 was from sales, and  $1,000 was from fees earned. Also, ABC Company  had $28,000 in total expenses. Of the  expenses, $10,000 came from paying employee salaries, $8,000 came from rent expenses, and  $5,000 came from interest expenses. Furthermore, ABC Company  had $3,000 of income tax  expenses, $1,000 in depreciation expenses, $1,000 of utility expenses. A clas s assignment may  require students to complete an income statement that would look like the following table .    Income Statement  ABC Company    For Fiscal Year Ended  December 31   Revenues       Service revenue  $50,000     Sales      4,000     Fees earned      1,000     Total revenues   $55,000        Expenses       Salary expense  $10,000     Rent expense      8,000     Interest expense      5,000     Income tax expense      3,000     Depreciation expense      1,000     Utilities expense      1,000     Total expenses   $28,000        Net income    $27,000     It should be noted that the net income of $27,000 was calculated by subtracting the total  expenses of $28,000 from the total revenues of $55,000. ABC Company ’s net income will be  used to prepare the next financial statement, which is the statement of retai ned earnings.          Provided by   Accounting Financial Statements   The Academic Center for Excellence  3 May  2022   Statement of Retained Earnings   The reason this is the second statement to prepare is because the retained earnings are needed  to prepare the equity section of the balance sheet. T he first item needed to determine a  company’s  retained earnings for a period is to record the retained earni ngs from the beginning  of the period. Next, add the company’s net income from the income statement to the amount of retained earnings at the beginning of the period. Finally, subtract how much money was paid in dividends to the company’s shareholders.   Example:   The following table shows ABC Company ’s retained earnings as of the end of the fiscal year on  December 31st. It should be noted that ABC Company  started the year with $12,000 in retained  earnings. They also had a net income of $27,000 for year, which  was calculated by preparing  the income statement. Lastly, they paid out $4,000 in dividends to company shareholders  during the fiscal year. A class assignment may require students to complete a statement of retained earnings for ABC Company that would loo k like the following table.     Statement of  Retained Earnings  ABC Company   For Fiscal Year Ended  December 31st    Retained earnings  (January 1st)  $12,000   Add Net income    27,000     $39,000   Subtract  Dividends    4,000    Retained earnings   (December 31st)  $35,000     In this example, ABC Company  started the fiscal year with $12,000. After adding $27,000 to that  amount, the running total is $39,000. Next, $4,000 is subtracted from that to account for  dividend payments. Therefore, ABC Company  ends the year with $35,000 in retained earnings.  The $35,000 in retained earnings will be needed to prepare the equity section of the next  financial statement, the balance sheet.            Provided by   Accounting Financial Statements   The Academic Center for Excellence  4 May  2022   Balance Sheet   The balance sheet is prepared using the accounting equation formula. Therefore, it should be  set up as assets = liabilities + equity. The company’s asset accounts should be recorded on the  left side of the page, while its liabilities and equity accounts should be recorded on the right  side of the page. Assets are any tangible item of value that a company owns. Common examples of assets are cash, accounts receivable, land, equipment, and inventory. Liabilities are debts the company owes to other entities, such as lenders, sellers, and other companies.  Common examples of liabilities are accounts payable, wages payable, notes payable, and taxes  payable. The difference between a company’s assets and liabilities is the company’s equity. Within the equity section of the balance sheet, the company’s retained earnings and common stock are listed. The reason the balance sheet is the third statement prepared is because the  cash account balance in assets is needed for the statement of cash flows. The following table  shows ABC Company’s balance sheet on December 31st.   Example:   On December 31 st, ABC Company  had $75,000 in total assets. Of their assets, they had $50,000  in cash, $20,000 in inventory, and $5,000 in accounts receivable. ABC Company  also had  $27,000 in total l iabilities. Of their liabilities, they had $15,000 in wages payable, $6,000 in  accounts payable, $3,000 in taxes payable, and $3,000 in notes payable. In addition, ABC  Company  had $48,000 in equity. Of their equity, they had $13,000 in common stock and  $35,000 in retained earnings. A class assignment may require students to complete a balance sheet for ABC Company that would look like the following table.     Balance Sheet  ABC Company    December 31st   Assets   Liabilities    Cash  $50,000  Wages payable  $15,000   Inventory    20,000  Accounts payable      6,000   Accounts receivable      5,000  Taxes payable      3,000     Notes payable      3,000     Total liabilities   $27,000          Equity      Common stock  $13,000     Retained earnings    35,000     Total equity  $48,000        Total assets  $75,000  Total liabilities and equity  $75,000    Provided by   Accounting Financial Statements   The Academic Center for Excellence  5 May  2022   In the example above, it should be noted that the value of the total assets equals the value of  the total liabilities and equity combined, which is $75,000 for each.

"Financial Statement Review:    Financial Statements Tutorial    There are four major financial statements used to communicate information to external users (creditors,  investors, suppliers, etc.)  -  1. Balance Sheet  (assets, liabilities, and Shareholder’s equity)  2. Income Statement (r evenues and expenses)  3. Statement of Changes in Shareholder’s E quity (contributed capital and retained earnings)   Statement of Retained Earnings  4. Statement of Cash Flows    Balance Sheet   Financial statement that presents the financ ial position of the company on a particular date.   Summarized by the accounting equation which must always be in balance  (Assets=Liabilities + Shareholder’s Equity)   Three categories of accounts:  1.

Statement of Cash Flows    Balance Sheet   Financial statement that presents the financ ial position of the company on a particular date.   Summarized by the accounting equation which must always be in balance  (Assets=Liabilities + Shareholder’s Equity)   Three categories of accounts:  1. Assets    Three Characteristics of Assets  a) It has probable future benefit that involves a ca pacity to contribute directly or indirectly to  future net cash flows  b) A particular entity can obtain the benefit  and control other’s access to the asset  c) The transaction that result ed in the entity’s right to the benefit of the asset has already  occurred   Examples: Cash, Accounts Receivable, Land, E quipment, Construction in Progress, Patents,  Copyrights, G oodwill, etc.    2. Liabilities   Amounts that company owes to its creditors   Examples: Notes Payable, Accounts  Payable, Unearned Revenue, etc.    3.

It cost Tom $15.  Tom’s revenue is $20, his cost of goods sold  (expense) is $15, and his net income is $5.    Multiple Step Income Statement  (only used for merchandising companies)  Sales  -Cost of Goods Sold  Gross Profit  -Operating Expenses   Operating Income  +/- Miscellaneous   Net Income before taxes -Income Tax Expense  Net Income  Statement of Changes in Shareholder’s Equity    Contributed Capital and retained earnings     Retained Earnings :  Beginning Retained Earnings  Less Dividends  Plus Net Income or Minus Net Loss  Ending Retained Earnings    Statement of Cash Flows   Financial statement that measures activities involving cash  receipts and cash  payments over an interval of time  (usually one accounting period).    Cash flows can be classified into one of three categories:  1.
