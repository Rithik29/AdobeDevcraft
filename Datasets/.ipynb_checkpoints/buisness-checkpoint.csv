Duration of Service : The works for which tenders are invited are far more time consuming that those for which quotations are invited. For example, construction of buildings, roads, bridges, dam, delivery of stationery to a college/university for one or two or more years etc.  4.  Earnest Money:  When tenders are invited, they are submitted along with a certain amount prescribed in the notiﬁcation. That amount is known as ‘Earnest Money’. It is a kind of caution money.

Hence, it never unde restimates the value of their grievances. For, addressing t hem dul y not only helps them retaining a  healthy relationship with their customers but also it contributes to impr oving t heir services and consequently their credibility and mo netary beneﬁts. A letter of adjustment is therefore drafted in response to the complaint/claim letter sent by a customer/ complainant. It aims at providing satisfactory explanation to the customer so as to retain his/her trust to continue a healthy business relationship. In addition, at times, particularly in the cases of claim letters, the service provider may also oﬀer reasonable compensation to the customer if he found the claim justiﬁable when compared with the loss.Adjus tmen t Letters M/s Sharma & Sons Enterprises  Opposite Nehru Garden  Indore- 685849  P.No: 7692847453  shrmaenterp@gmail.com 12 April 2019 Reference No: XYZ123 The Sales Man  M/s Chouksey Electronics  Near Railway Station  Bhopal Subject: Letter of AdjustmentLetter of Adjus tmen t Dear Sir,  We genuinely apologize and regret the loss caused to you on account of delay in the delivery of products ordered by you via your letter number xyz123 dated 23 March 2019.

"To whom it may concern: Elon Musk’s takeover of Twitter will further toxify our information ecosystem  and be a direct threat to public safety, especially among those already most  vulnerable and marginalized.   Twitter has outsized influence in shaping both public discourse and industry- wide platform governance standards. While the company is hardly a poster- child for healthy social media, it  has taken welcome steps in recent years to  mitigate systemic risks, ratcheting up pressure on the likes of Facebook and  YouTube to follow suit. Musk intends to steamroll those safeguards and provide  a megaphone to extremists who traffic in disinformation, hate, and harassment.  Under the guise of ‘free speech,’ his vision will silence and endanger marginalized  communities, and tear at the fraying fabric of democracy. The undersigned organizations believe that Twitter should continue to uphold the  practices that serve as guideposts for other Big Tech platforms. We call on you –  Twitter’s top advertisers – to commit to these standards as non-negotiable  requirements for advertising on the platform: 1. Keep accounts including those of public figures and politicians that were  removed for egregious violations of Twitter Rules – such as harassment,  violence, and hateful conduct – off the platform and continue to enforce  the civic integrity policy  along with the hateful conduct policy . Since 2020,  Twitter has applied its civic integrity policy to all users, including elected  officials. Musk’s statements at Ted2022 last week indicate that he will  roll-back permanent bans and err on the side of allowing harmful content  to remain on the platform under the guise of ‘free speech.’ A reversal of  Twitter’s content moderation policies including its recently released climate  commitments, its protections for transgender people, and its restrictions on  other forms of hate, harassment, and violence would be toxic not just for those  targeted, but also for businesses advertising on the platform. 2. Beyond algorithmic transparency, ensure algorithmic accountability,  preserve people’s privacy, and commit to depolarizing the algorithm.

Introduction : The quantum leap intechnology has made presentations a favourite tool of the present day communicator. Presentations are used for various objectives –from delivering lectures to making sales pitches, from disse minating information topersuading people, from selling products and projects tousing them assubstitutes for live demonstrations. Infact, even theover -head projector that was once sopopular asamode ofpresentation has paved way forthe power packed ,power -point presentation. So popular and universal is its use that it is considered an indispensable facility available for use onthecomputer. The useofcolour, images and dramatic effects available with the program notonly lend anaesthetic appeal toyour campaign but also make itlively and interesting. One of the chief advantages ofthis mode isthat itisvery economical; the matter ofthepresentation packed into toomany slides can now beeasily carried onthe CD, floppy orpen-drive. With a computer, aprojector and ascreen, itcan bedelivered with justtheclick ofa MOUSE. Nowonder theability tomake effective presentations isconsidered to be akin toafine art. Various inputs are required tomake amemorable presentation, but like any other skill this too can be perfected with practice. Institutions ofhigher education and business schools have made itanintegral part ofcourse content. Itistherefore necessary to examine the components that gointo the skill ofmaking wonderful presentations.2 To begin with there are three important steps : A.Determining thepurpose. B.Preparation. C.Delivery. A.THE PURPOSE. Atthevery outset one should define thespecific objective of thepresentation. Generally, itcould one ofthefollowing: to inform, topersuade or to entertain. Toinform :This isthe chief objective when one has to teach, toinstruct, todemonstrate orinduct employees ina company. Aprogress report orsales report of an organization would also beprimarily imparting information. When theinformation to be imparted isvast itmakes good sense tocategorise itinto smaller units under common factors. This allows the presenter and the audience to marshal alotofinformation into manageable bits, easy to understand, retainorreproduce. To persuade :Whatever the immediate objective ofa presentation, inthe long run, every presenter has to persuade the audience that the presentation isworth listening to,that itwould benefit them. Itisonly when one is sopersuaded that one would bewilling toattend toit,more sowhen itisanunsolicited presentation that one has not asked for. Butthere aresome presentations that aremeant purely forpersuasion, particularly those that areaimed at sales ofproducts, projects orservices, orthose aimed at getting contracts. Such presentations should incorporate the principles for sales inaddition tothose ofagood presentation ifthe desired objective ofwinning thecontract isto be achieved. To entertain :Some presentations would seek tomerely entertain the audience. For example, presentations delivered atgatherings and meetings that arenotpurely for business oreducational purpose. These may bedelivered at informal orsocial meetings, forexample, eminen t persons from various fields, invited todeliver atalk, aspeech ora presentation. Any presentation should have some entertainment value. Aliberal dose oflight hearted humour acts asastress reliever and provides awelcome change to enable listeners toconcentrate better onthe important matters that follow.3 B.PREPARATION : Athorough planning isthemain ingredient ofaneffective presentation. There is no substitute for adequate preparation. One should plan thepreparation sothat itcan begiven atrial aswell. Itisnecessary toremember that spending too much time onpreparation may result in relatively little time for atrial run. Often preparation may involve alotofprimary research such ascollecting facts and figures, orsecondary resear ch, which iscollecting and gleaning data from research work already done articles, journals and magazines. The data and information gathered isattimes sovoluminous that organizing itand compressing ittofit into thelimit of given time could be a daunting task. Itis therefore advisable to organize allrelevant material into aworkable outline. Ideally the outline tooshould be around five tonine points. This helps in organizing data systematically and discarding unwanted and irrelevant details. Needless tosay the outline and thepresentation should be designed around anintroduction, abody and aconclusion. One should first plan anappropriate title. Astriking, catchy and anapt title often creates agood first impression and gives anidea about the rest ofthe presentation. For example, The Best ofTimes, The Worst ofTimes The Globalized World !Adramatic introduction using striking visuals, newspaper headlines oraquotation help toarrest the attention of the audience. The body, indealing with the actual content ofthetopic, should beorganized logically and systematically tomake the main point. Finally, the conclusion also should aim atcreating animpact on the audience .Tomake iteffective, one could use aquotation or arhetori cal question oreven arehearsed interactive episode with the audience. Aspart ofpreparation, particularly ifthepresentation has the important agenda ofclinching asales deal, it is advisable forbeginners totake atrial run. This means also ensurin gthetime limit. Exceeding thetime limit, orfalling short ofit,both could be disastrous. Itisalso advisable, toselect oreven choose atopic oneself. This allows the student to be more enthusiastic, more convincing and more confident. Preparation also implies obtaining audience profile –such asage group, interests,4 occupations etc. Testing the place for sound, light, ventilation and seating arrangement isabig help inensuring the equipment does not fail atthe crucial moment. If possible, one should fixthetiming ofthepresentation tosuit itspurpose. For example apost -lunch session isavery difficult and challenging slotaspeople tend to be sluggish. C.DELIVERY. The delivery of the presentation covers two aspects – i) the visual and ii) t he oral. The visual aspect refers tothetext and theimages used. One must ensure that theslides are attractive in terms of color, effects, images and text, for which power point packages offer agreat variety. And yet, they should notbe soattractive as to cause adistraction! Facts, figures and spellings should beaccurate aserrors when displayed on thescreen areglaringly conspicuous. The oral delivery ofthepresentation isequally oroften more important than thevisuals and itshould both compl ement and reinforce thevisuals. Careful attention should bepaid to voice modulation, correct Pronunciation, use oftones appropriate choice ofwords with pauses attheright place to emphasize apoint. Apart from thevoice body language is yet another i mportant factor ofapresentation. Research and experience have proved that the speaker‘s posture, gestures, facial expression and dressing, impact anaudience asmuch or more than thecontent and delivery ofspeech. For formal presentations, isitforbusiness or at aformal gathering, formal dressing isbest suited? The clothes should beabove allcomfortable and complement the speaker, notdistract the audience. Practice would instill confidence and poise whereas nervousness would bevisible intheabsen ceofa natural ease and asmile. Eye contact isavery important feature ofany interface. It makes each person inthe audience feel asense of inclusiveness and helps the speaker judge the instant feedback from thefacial expressions ofthelisteners. Italso acts asapowerful deterrent tothose who are fidgety and likely tocause disturbance. Agood speaker has tomake a conscious effort inthebeginning tomake eyecontact with all sections and with experience this may happen naturally. Often, beginn erstend tobenervous and edgy. Butpractice and rehearsal before friends, oreven bef ore amirror in5 privacy, goes along way indeveloping confidence. Italso helps inmaking aconscious effort tobreathe deep just before delivery, inorder todispel nervousness. Last, and certainly nottheleast, one must remember that a generous dose ofHUMOUR isasignificant and essential part ofanygood presentation. When thetopics areheavy or with alotofcomplex matter, humour not only provides a necessary relief butthevariation enables theaudience togo back tothe topic easily. Apresentation peppered with humorous anecdotes orquotations often leaves an indelible mark inthememory ofthelisteners! A.) Evaluating your presentation: A checklist.

Introduction. Shahrukh Khan goes for 6pack abs. Amir Khan upto8pack abs.6 Leena Mogre opens her hi -style gym. Fitness First opens in Oshivara. Cloud 9 opens its 9 thoutlet in Bandra. Respected judges, profess orsand friends, Are allthese a symbol ofarising and shining India? Yes, but much more, they asign ofthechanging times, anincreasingly body and health conscious people ofafast developing country India. 1.Friends you must beaware that with ahappy rising GDP and asatisfying soaring sensex there isalso adistressing increase insuicides, hyper tension, diabetes, depression and heart ailments. Infact ithas been predicted that India willbethediabetes capital oftheworld. And who orwhat is to beblamed for this state ofaffairs? Notjust the nature of thefast-paced modern life but also thewrong health habits ofthepeople. 2.Life onthefast track has itsown advantages and pitfalls. Today‘s youth isfocused and inahurry toachieve success. One may get agood job, income, lifestyle and all the trappings ofsuccess, butatwhat cost? They have little time tosavour the little pleasures oflife, The result islong working hours, lack ofsleep, stress and hyper tension. Surely lifeisnotallabout financial security and professional success alone? One needs good health toenjoy thefruits of success. 3.Itisnotuncommon orstrange that practically everyday newspapers and other media areadvocating theimportance ofexercise and right diet. Exe rcise istothebody what active usage istoany machine. Take theexample ofany car ora sewing machine that isnot put touseforacouple ofmonths. Itisbutnatural that after acouple ofmonths ofdisuse the car‘s battery would have discharged, themachinery rusted orclogged. Butarunning machine would beinexcellent form giving peak performance with anoccasional servicing. 4Similarly the mind too gets sharper and more effective with mental exercise and training aswell asright thinking. Sotoo the spirit and soul ofman would bemore receptive toawareness and acceptance ofdivine grace when kept ingood shape with the spiritual exercise of prayer, meditation and fasting. 5.The benefits ofexercise aremanifold. Anexercised body isready forpeak performance because it is energetic. A person has greater stamina. Itincreases heart rate and blood supply toall the parts ofthebody. Exercise releases7 endorphins which impart tothe body aheightened awareness and asense ofwellbeing as well as alertness. Itengenders thevalue ofself-discipline and hard work. Itmakes one focused and sure and determined. The sense ofwell being makes aperson cheerful and enthusiastic. These qualities are key drivers inaperson‘s attitude to work and relationships. Such anindividual would also bepositive, easy toget along with and anactive contributor tosociety. 6.Having said that weneed toconsider thedifferent ways of bodily exercise. The modern world offers arich variety of ways. There are ofcourse the modern gyms which have become sopopular. There are the older variations ofthe humble home grown gyms, thevyayamshalasandthe akharas.Thepoleclimbing and wrestling and boxing as much asthekarate and thejudo are other forms ofboth exercise, sport and body fitness combined. There isour very own Yoga, now aninternationally renowned form ofboth mental and physical fitness. But what about thecheapest and commonest form offitness and exercise that any one canuse? Why it is the the simplest walking and jogging or running. No need ofspending hefty amounts infashionable gyms ortraining schools. Any one can walk orgradually progress torunasmall stretch oftheroad. This explains the popularity ofthepubl icparks with running tracks and tracks forwalking. They are the popu larNana Naniparks and friends ifyou notice there arepeople ofallages and sizes and shapes, notjustgrandparentsandoldies.Evenifthe parks arenamed forthem! This also expla insthepopularity ofthe oldadage:Aftersuppe rrestawhile,afterdinner walk amile. Ofcourse one doesn‘t advocate running after dinner. Also observe how the doctors are all always advising people towalk everyday for at least half anhour daily. A brisk walk oraslow run are what can dowonders, and allat nocost! 7.The Marathons are yet another feature that explain the popularity ofrunning. Watch how young and old have all enthusiastically taken toitand not just inIndia butallover theworld. They have also helped focus attention onacause and helped multinational and national companies contribute their bit by demonstrating corporate responsibility. And so inconclusion friends Ican only stress the importance of running tomake your lifelonger, healthier and happ ierby saying:Keepawaystrife,TakeyourwifeandRunforyour Life.8 B)The ( OHP ) ---the Over -Head Projector The OHP or the Over -Head Projector is another popular tool used for making presentations where the computer facility for a power - point presentation (PPT) is not possible. It is a low cost alternative affording an interactive environment, especially to educators. The OHP consists of a large box containing a very bright lamp and a fan to cool it, on top of whi ch is a large lens. Above the box extends an arm with a mirror at its end. The lens focuses and redirects the light forward instead of up above. Transparencies (sheets of thick transparent plastic, with the matter to be projected either printed or written on it) are placed on top of the lens for display. The light from the lamp travels through the transparency and on the mirror, where it is shone for display. The mirror allows both the presenter and the audience to see the image at the same time, the pres enter looking down at the OHP top and the audience at the screen. The height of the mirror is adjustable to help focus the image on the screen. The advantage of the OHP is that it is portable (though it is heavy!) and the transparencies, once prepared, ca n be put to repeated use and can be easily carried and preserved. They can be used to photo -copy text and illustrations, in colour or in black, and when it9 is not possible to photo -copy one can write and illustrate oneself, using the special markers or pen s. As in a ppt, care should be taken that the text is not in small font or detailed. Only bold font size should be used in outline or point - form. The same attention, as for a ppt, should be paid namely , correctness, the correct order, (preferably numbered ), attractiveness, (notdistraction) , and clear visibility. C)The Use ofVisual Aids and Graphics. The success ofanycommunication depends not only onhow one accesses information and organized it,butalso onhow well one presents it.Inorder to make amessage , or a presentation orareport more comprehensible ,graphics or visual aids areused. In this section, students will learn the importance and effective use of visual aids that will help them in making effective presentations oral and written. Comm only used visual aids are tables, bar charts, line-charts, pie charts, maps, flowcharts, diagrams and photographs. Why are the visual aids used? 1.Visual aids are used tosimplify thematter. Complicated data canbesimplified with the help ofconceptual mo dels, diagrams, and charts. 2.Visual aids clarify numerical information, procedures, trends. 3.They areused toemphasize, toimpress and toattract the attention ofthereceiver. 4.They areused tosummarise thedata. 5.They are used toestablish linkage orunity indiverse points. 6.Their impact islong lasting. Types ofVisual Aids. 1.Tables: Tables include vertical columns and horizontal rows. Facts and figures could bepresented with thehelp of tables. Tables are good for precise numerical data. However, they a re tedious to prepare. For e.g:10 Combined First –Year Cost For Four Sites Locations Cost (in Rs.) Kandivali Borivali Dahisar Miraroad Lease 90,000 95,000 80,000 75,000 Property Tax 20,000 20,000 18,000 13,000 Maintenance 20,000 20,000 15,000 13,000 Transportation 50,000 50,000 60,000 60,000 Total 1,80,000 1,85,000 1,73,000 1,61,000 2.Simple Bar Chart : These are used for quantities or growth over a period of time. For e.g.: 3.Multiple Range Bar Chart/ Diagram. : These make use of vertical and horizo ntal axis. They can besegmented aswell as clustered. These are generally used to depict proportional relationships and comparisons. They are often incorrectly drawn and lead to lack of clarity. For e.g.: Line Chart :These make use ofvertical and horizontal axis. One hastousetheright scale topresent thedata. These are generally used fordepicting trends. However, too many lines canbecome very confusing. Fore.g.:11 5.PieChart :Asthe name indicates, itlooks like apie and itsdivisions look like the slices ofthe pie. Itis effectively used formaking quantitative analysis orforthe presentation oftechnical data. Use ofcolours makes the presentation attractive. Itisbest used foremphasizing a comparative data. For e.g.: 6.Flow Charts: Flow charts are easy tounderstand diagrams that convey information step bystep. 1st Qtr 2nd Qtr 3rdQtr 4thQtr 12 7.Organizational Charts: These areused todisplay physical orconceptual relationships rather than numerica lones. For e.g.: These apart, transparencies, sketches, maps, pictograms, posters, films are the commonly used forms of visual aids.

Itallows agroup toexchange thoughts and ideas among themselves. GD helps theorganization getan idea about candidates ina short time and assess those skills, which normally cannot be evaluated inaninterview. Agroup discussion generally follows awritten test. Inthis method, agroup ofcandidates isgiven atopic orasituation and asked to discuss itamong themselves for not mo rethan half anhour. Anideal group for GDconsists of8-10candidates, though figures may vary depending onthesituation. Companies conduct group discussions after thewritten test (which checks the candidate‘s technical and conceptual skills) tochec kthecandidate‘s interactive and interpersonal skills. The GD attempts toassess candidate‘s behaviour, teamwork, leadership skills, initiative, confidence, listening skills, and open -mindedness inaccepting contrary opinions, and participation and contri bution inagroup. The focus ofa GDisthus on verbal communicative ability non-verbal cues leadership skills persuasive skills Verbal Communicative Ability : This includes good knowledge ofthesubject athand and the power tocommunicate it inaneffective manner. Nothing can compensate forin-depth knowledge ofthesubject, though it isaherculean task tokeep oneself up-to-date onall14 possible topics. Agood reading habit with focus onvarious areas like finance, management, politics, society, sci ence, technology, sports, entertainment, etc. can help inbuilding confidence toexpress one‘s views onaparticular topic. While apositive impact can becreated bytalking forcefully and convincingly onasubject, this ispossible only when the candidat ehas enough knowledge ofthe subject under discussion. Clarity ofthought and precision ofexpression arepreferred toverbosity and irrelevant talk. One should speak asmuch asisnecessary, neither more nor less. The language must beformal, plain and simple; pedantry and jargon must be avoided. Slang, informal expressions, etc. should also be avoided. Appraisers also look for the ability to listen: the candidate‘s ability to react to the opinions of other participants. Hence, it is necessary to listen carefully to others and then react or proceed to add some more points. Non-Verbal Cues: Non-verbal cues are equally important. The importance of non-verbal cues has already been discussed intheprevious chapter onnon-verbal communication. The evaluato rwill scrutinize body language, eye contact, etc. ofthe candidates. Itistherefore essential tomaintain agood rapport with fellow participants. Non-verbal gestures, such as listening intently or nodding while appreciating someone‘s viewpoint, send across apositive message. Listening carefully can beaway ofencouraging other speaker and exhibiting leadership skills aswell. Participants must communicate with each and every candidate present. While speaking one must not look atonly asingle member, andespecially notattheevaluator. Body language says alot about theindividual -one‘s gestures and mannerisms are more likely toreflect one‘s attitude than what one says. Leadership Skills: The aim ofagroup discussion isalso tojudge acandidate‘ s leadership qualities. The evaluator recedes into the background once the discussion starts. The evaluator‘s attention isonthecandidates and the manner inwhich they display tact, skill, and understanding and leadership qualities tomotivate and influe nce other candidates.15 Persuasive Skills: The evaluator also looks atthemanner inwhich acandidate convinces theother members ofthegroup, and theclarity with which thecandidate expresses his/her point ofview. The candidate should therefore bearticulate, generate ideas, notsound boring, allow others tospeak, and have the ability toadopt astand onagiven subject. Even when disagreeing with another candidate, thedisagreement must beexpressed politely. The GD Process: AGD generally consis tsofthree parts: the initiation, the body ofthe GD, and summarization/conclusion. Initiation : The candidate initiating aGDnotonly gets theopportunity to speak first but also grabs theattention oftheevaluator and his/ herfellow candidates. Ithelps if the candidate canmake afavourable first impression with his/her content and communication skills ininitiating aGD. However, ifa candidate initiates aGD and falters, itmight dent his/her chances ofmaking afavourable impression ontheevalu ator. Ifthecandidate initiates theGD clearly butremains quiet after that, s/he will end upgiving theimpression that s/he started theGDonly forthesake of starting itorgetting those initial brownie points awarded toaninitiator. Itistheinitiator‘s responsibility toputthetopic into the right perspective orframework. Soitis better to initiate aGDonly ifone has in-depth knowledge about the topic being discussed. Ifone isnot sure ofthetopic athand, it is better tolisten carefully totheviews being expressed byothers and then speak. One should notbeinahurry toexpress one‘s opinion. The Body ofDiscussion: This isthemain part oftheGDwhere all the members ofthe group express their opinions onthetopic. Candidates must restrict themselves toconveying their viewpoints and not use the GD as acontest torun down other arguments. Candidates can politely agree, disagree orchoose toremain neutral. Aspeaker should never beinterrupted while speaking. Speaking out ofturn andcutting others short create anegative impression. Too much aggression can put offprospective employers.16 While speaking, theentire group must beaddressed sothat everyone isattentive towards what isbeing said. The focus should never be on theevaluator. Toemphasize thecontent, relevant proverbs, quotes, definitions, facts and figures, statistics, etc. may beused. While using figures or statistics, itmust beremembered that macro figures may be generalized, while micro figures must bespecific. Summarization / Conclusion: Aconclusion iswhere thewhole group decides infavor of against the topic. Generally, aGD does not have a conclusion. But the discussion isalways summarized. One of thecandidates isinvited tosummarize thediscussion. This signals theend ofthe GD. The candidate must summarize all that thegroup has discussed. The following can bekept in mind while summarizing aGD: The summary must bebrief and succinct. Allimportant points discussed must beincluded. The focus must not be on the points made bythe presenter, alone. Nonew points must bestated here. II.INTERVIEWS Introduction: An interview isaformal conversation inwhich both concerned parties attempt tofind outiftheother party offers something valuable tothem. Allorganisations, irrespective ofsize orindustry, need and use interviews toselect the right candidate fortheright job. Joe McDermott definesan interviewas:―acomp lexinteractionbetweentwoparties both ofwhom areoffering something while simultaneou sly seekingtohaveaneedmet.Aninterviewisatwo-way process ofcommunication where both the concerned partieshaveaneed ;theinterviewersseekinformation from the candidate to determine whether s/he is the right candidate forthejob, while the candidate tries todecide whether thejoband theorganisation areright forhim/her. The purpose ofaninterview may vary depending ontheneed and the situation. Interviews areheld not only forselection of candidates but also for promotion, redressal ofgrievances, assessment ofperformance, etc. I.Types ofInterviews: A)Selection Interview: This type ofinterview isalso known as Job Interview,Employmen tInterview,Service17 Interview etc.Themain objective istoselect theright candidate for the right position. Apart from the application letter, curriculum vitae and other documents that aprospective candidate sends theemployers, it is essential that aface -to- face meeting take place between the employers and the candidate tocheck the suitability ofthe candidate forthe position for which s/he isbeing recruited. This also gives the employer anopportunity toassess theentire personality ofthe candidate and choose one from among themany applican tsfor thejob. Most recruiters look for three important requirements in a candidate: Aptitude and Ability Commitment Adaptability Aptitude and Ability indicate the capacity to do the job. Through theinterview, theinterviewer tries tofind outifthe qualities and qualifications mentioned intheCV/Resume are borne outthrough thereplies ofthecandidate. Commitment isloyalty and dedication towards thecompany. The interviewer isinterested inknowing ifthecandidate has along -term interest inthecompany i.e. will thecandidate stick on to the job orquit inafewmonths. The interviewer is obviously notinterested inrepeating therecruitment process inthenear future. Adaptability istheease with which thecandidate will fit into thecompany: interpersonal relationships, theworking style, values, etc. II.Interview Styles: 1.Directional: This interview style isextremely structured. The interviewer asks specific, direct questions inapre-set order. One reason forusing this format may betheneed to maintain consistency across candidates throughout the interview and tomake the selection process easier and fairer. This style may also beused forrecruitment atlower levels bylarge organisations that receive too many applications inresponse totheir recruitment drive. 2.Non -Directional: This style isused mainly forhigher level recruitment and ismore like aconversation than a question -answer session. The interviewer uses open -ended questions todraw outresponses from thecandidate.18 3.Behavi oral: This style isused bytheinterviewer tojudge theperformance ofthecandidate inthesame/similar role in theprevious company. Inthisstyle, candidates areexpected to answer questions with specific examples ofhow they have tackled problems, han dled various situations, etc. 4.Presentation :This isagain used athigher levels where candidates are expected tomake apresentation before apanel. One must remember, however, that none ofthese styles will be used inisolation. An interview will consist ofa combination ofthese styles. III.Format ofInterviews: 1.Pre-Interview Tests :This format isused when an unusually large number ofcandidates has applied forafew posts. Itisgenerally intheform ofawritten test which tests both general and specific technical skills. This iscommon in ITjobs, government jobs, etc. Incase ofjobs requiring strenuous physical activity and alertness ofmind e.g. armed forces, security personnel, bodyguards, etc. there may be physical and mental tests aswell. Gro upDiscussions may also betreated as part ofthe pre-interview test. Other methods could include case study, role-play, etc. 2.Individual :This is aninterview where asingle interviewer meets the candidate. Generally, the HR department isinvolved inthis task where, from thestack of applications, potential candidates arescreened for the main interview. Inthis stage, the focus isnot onthe technical know -how ofthe candidate but more oncommitment and adaptability. The questions willbe based onthecandidate‘s previous jobs, reasons forleaving, salary, CTC, perks and allowances, salary expectations, etc. Later, thecandidate may meet theprospective boss, head ofthedepartment, etc forsimilar one-on-one interviews where subject knowledge, techni cal skills willbetested. 3.Panel Interviews :Here, two ormore people form a panel tointerview the candidate atthe same time. Generally, thepanel consists ofthehead of thedepartment, one member oftheHRdepartment, and athird person. There may be an internal/external expert onthepanel, ifrequired. The structure ofthe interview will bethe same, the only difference being that thequestions willbeasked byallthe panelists, with each ofthem performing adifferent role on the panel.19 IV.Structu reoftheInterview : The structure ofmost interviews follows asimilar pattern. Different experts may label it in different ways, but it essentially consists of an introduction, themain body ofthe interview –the Q&A session –and closing. Itissomet imes referred to as the WASP technique :Welcoming the candidate, Asking questions, Supplying information and Parting. IIntroduction: This involves welcoming thecandidate and making him/her comfortable. Itallows thecandidate time to arrange his/her bag,files, etc. and settle down. Atthesame time, the interviewers get anopportunity toassess the dress, body language and other non-verbal cues ofthe candidate and form afirst impression. Agood posture, pleasant smile, afirm handshake may contribut etoan excellent first impression. IIThe Q&A session :After theintroduction, theinterview moves into thesecond round –the Q&A session. The scene for this round issetgradually bytheintervie wers by providing information about the organisation, job requirements, purpose and goal oftheinterview, etc. The Q&A session isatwo-way process designed totest the aptitude, ability, commitment and adaptability ofthe candidate. Questioning Styles : Depending on the goal of the interview, different quest ioning styles may be used. The most familiar ones are as follows : 1)Closedquestions :Theymaytypicallybe ―yes-no‖ questions and mainly used for confirmation. They are specific and require short answers only. 2)Open -ended questions :These questions cannot be answeredwithayesorno.Theygenerally begin with How, What, Why, When, Tell me, etc., drawing outthecandidate‘s response. 3)Probing questions :These questions areused tofollow up on what thecandidate may have just replied. Itattempts toprobe indifferent ways toget detailed answers to questions and find outifthecandidate ends upcontradicting what hementioned inthefirstplace .Suchquestionscould include ―Tellmemoreabou t… ―Whatdoyoumea nwhen yousaythat…?―Canyouspelloutinmoredetail…etc.20 4)Leading questions :They aredesigned tofigure outthe candidates views, opinions, etc. onavariety ofissues. Typicalquestions world include : So what doyouthink of…… I seefrom your resume that……etc. Six Types of Interview Questions: 1.Behavioural Interview Questions :These questions attempt toassess the candidate‘s performance inthe same/similar role intheprevious company. Ahypothetic al situation isgiven tothecandidate and his/her response to that situation istallied with the requirements ofthe role. Some questions could be as follows: How didyourespond toaparticular stressful situation? Describe aproblem and how you solved it What would you doif................................ ....? 2.Competency based Questions: These are questions that aim atfinding out the aptitude and ability ofthe candidate togetthejobdone. Ittests theskill sets available with thecandidate and tallies itwith therequire ments ofthe job. How does one read aBalance Sheet? What are the important Accounting entries tobepassed ? How will youplan and organise ................................ ....? What method willyouuse to…………………………… ? 3.Personality based Interview Questions :These questions aredesigned tolettheinterviewer understand the candidate‘s adaptability totheculture oftheorganisation. Tell ussomething about yourself. What doyoudoinyour free time? 4.Technical Interview Questions :This type of question seeks tofind outthecand idate‘s level ofknowledge with a particular software, system, equipment, etc. It could also deal with knowledge of rules, regulations, principles, formulae, auditing / accounting standards, etc. 5.Stress based Interview Questions :This mode of questioning puts the candidate inan awkward and uncomfortable position totest his response. The focus may beonthe negative points inthe candidate‘s professional career. Questions could deal with gaps incareer, stagnation, lack ofcareer development, etc.21 6.Resume based Questions :These questions deal specifically with details mentioned inthe resume. They could bequestions based onpersonal details, educational qualifications, achievements, work experience, earlier organisations that thecandidate worked wit h,career shifts, etc. Towards theend ofthis round, the candidate also gets a chance toask questions which willhelp determine ifthe job isright forhim/her. IIIClosure :This isthelast stage intheinterview structure and it is important toleave behind agood impression. This will help theemployers keep theinterviewee‘s profile in mind asthey decide onthe prospective candidate. The ending should begradual and not abrupt .It should end onapositive and cordial note, irrespective oftheresult oftheinterview. Even ifthecandidate isnotselected, heshould leave the interview with afeeling ofsatisfaction about thecompany. This will have abeneficial effect for the company ,forthe candidate will speak ingood terms about thecompany to outs iders. V.Preparing foraSelection Interview: Alotofpreparation isrequired ifaninterview isto accomplish itsobjectives. Both the interviewer and the candidate have toprepare themselves thoroughly to achieve thepurpose oftheinterview. i)Preparati ononpart of the interviewer: Inmost organisations, it is the HR department that is involved intheinterview process. The interviewer must be extremely clear about the purpose ofthe interview. The interview should achieve itsobjective and not become a waste oftime, money and resources fortheorganisation. The organisation should keep thefollowing inmind : Applications received must be scrutinised and prospective candidates shortlisted for the interview. Call letters toprospective candidat esshould besent well inadvance ofthedate oftheinterview with details ofday, date, time and place oftheinterview. Ifalotofcandidates areto be interviewed, astaggered time may beallotted tothe candidates. The letter should also indicate documents that the candidate should carry along with him/her tothe interview.22 Aninterviewer/ panel must beformed inadvance and the interviewer/s must beinformed inadvance about their appointment on the panel. A file with the candidates‘resumes must beprovided to them ,sothat they have some information about the candidates even before the interview begins. The interviewer/s must know details about the job profile, organisation, rules regarding appointment, salary, perks, other benefits, etc. Adata sheetforrecording grades and noting comments should bemade available totheinterviewers onthedayof theinterview. Onthe day oftheinterview, seating arrangements should bemade forthecandidates asthey wait for their turn. Some companies also provi derefreshments tothewaiting candidates. Documents /forms tobefilled bythe candidates appearing fortheinterview should be kept ready tobe given tothecandidates asthey come in. Separate staff should beinstructed totake care ofthe needs ofthecandidates. ii)Preparation onthepart oftheCandidate: Itisnotjust thesubject knowledge buttheentire personality ofthecandidate that isassessed attheinterview. Hence, the interviewee has topay adequate attention tophysical, mental and psycho logical preparation fortheinterview. Physical Preparation: Physical preparation is an extremely important part ofthe candidate‘s groundwork before aninterview. Itconsists notonly ofgrooming but also ofadocument check ontheday before theintervi ew. The required documents, certificates, testimonials, extra copies ofresume, copies ofpublications, etc. should beplaced in separate folders inafile sothat they can beproduced without anydifficulty when required. Personal appearance and cleanlin ess areequally important factors, asthecandidate must present awell-groomed look attheinterview. One must pay attention tobody odour, bad breath, hair, nails, hands and other aspects ofpersonal hygiene. Make -up,accessories, wardrobe play asignif icant role indetermining the personality ofthe candidate. Itis essential toensure that these factors are suitable tothe occasion. Make -upshould not begarish and accessories should beminimal. Clothes should beneatly pressed and as formal astheoccasion demands. Itwould beagood idea to avoid bright colours and flashy outfits. Shoes should be",Buisness

Introduction : The quantum leap intechnology has made presentations a favourite tool of the present day communicator. Presentations are used for various objectives –from delivering lectures to making sales pitches, from disse minating information topersuading people, from selling products and projects tousing them assubstitutes for live demonstrations. Infact, even theover -head projector that was once sopopular asamode ofpresentation has paved way forthe power packed ,power -point presentation. So popular and universal is its use that it is considered an indispensable facility available for use onthecomputer. The useofcolour, images and dramatic effects available with the program notonly lend anaesthetic appeal toyour campaign but also make itlively and interesting. One of the chief advantages ofthis mode isthat itisvery economical; the matter ofthepresentation packed into toomany slides can now beeasily carried onthe CD, floppy orpen-drive. With a computer, aprojector and ascreen, itcan bedelivered with justtheclick ofa MOUSE. Nowonder theability tomake effective presentations isconsidered to be akin toafine art. Various inputs are required tomake amemorable presentation, but like any other skill this too can be perfected with practice. Institutions ofhigher education and business schools have made itanintegral part ofcourse content. Itistherefore necessary to examine the components that gointo the skill ofmaking wonderful presentations.2 To begin with there are three important steps : A.Determining thepurpose. B.Preparation. C.Delivery. A.THE PURPOSE. Atthevery outset one should define thespecific objective of thepresentation. Generally, itcould one ofthefollowing: to inform, topersuade or to entertain. Toinform :This isthe chief objective when one has to teach, toinstruct, todemonstrate orinduct employees ina company. Aprogress report orsales report of an organization would also beprimarily imparting information. When theinformation to be imparted isvast itmakes good sense tocategorise itinto smaller units under common factors. This allows the presenter and the audience to marshal alotofinformation into manageable bits, easy to understand, retainorreproduce. To persuade :Whatever the immediate objective ofa presentation, inthe long run, every presenter has to persuade the audience that the presentation isworth listening to,that itwould benefit them. Itisonly when one is sopersuaded that one would bewilling toattend toit,more sowhen itisanunsolicited presentation that one has not asked for. Butthere aresome presentations that aremeant purely forpersuasion, particularly those that areaimed at sales ofproducts, projects orservices, orthose aimed at getting contracts. Such presentations should incorporate the principles for sales inaddition tothose ofagood presentation ifthe desired objective ofwinning thecontract isto be achieved. To entertain :Some presentations would seek tomerely entertain the audience. For example, presentations delivered atgatherings and meetings that arenotpurely for business oreducational purpose. These may bedelivered at informal orsocial meetings, forexample, eminen t persons from various fields, invited todeliver atalk, aspeech ora presentation. Any presentation should have some entertainment value. Aliberal dose oflight hearted humour acts asastress reliever and provides awelcome change to enable listeners toconcentrate better onthe important matters that follow.3 B.PREPARATION : Athorough planning isthemain ingredient ofaneffective presentation. There is no substitute for adequate preparation. One should plan thepreparation sothat itcan begiven atrial aswell. Itisnecessary toremember that spending too much time onpreparation may result in relatively little time for atrial run. Often preparation may involve alotofprimary research such ascollecting facts and figures, orsecondary resear ch, which iscollecting and gleaning data from research work already done articles, journals and magazines. The data and information gathered isattimes sovoluminous that organizing itand compressing ittofit into thelimit of given time could be a daunting task. Itis therefore advisable to organize allrelevant material into aworkable outline. Ideally the outline tooshould be around five tonine points. This helps in organizing data systematically and discarding unwanted and irrelevant details. Needless tosay the outline and thepresentation should be designed around anintroduction, abody and aconclusion. One should first plan anappropriate title. Astriking, catchy and anapt title often creates agood first impression and gives anidea about the rest ofthe presentation. For example, The Best ofTimes, The Worst ofTimes The Globalized World !Adramatic introduction using striking visuals, newspaper headlines oraquotation help toarrest the attention of the audience. The body, indealing with the actual content ofthetopic, should beorganized logically and systematically tomake the main point. Finally, the conclusion also should aim atcreating animpact on the audience .Tomake iteffective, one could use aquotation or arhetori cal question oreven arehearsed interactive episode with the audience. Aspart ofpreparation, particularly ifthepresentation has the important agenda ofclinching asales deal, it is advisable forbeginners totake atrial run. This means also ensurin gthetime limit. Exceeding thetime limit, orfalling short ofit,both could be disastrous. Itisalso advisable, toselect oreven choose atopic oneself. This allows the student to be more enthusiastic, more convincing and more confident. Preparation also implies obtaining audience profile –such asage group, interests,4 occupations etc. Testing the place for sound, light, ventilation and seating arrangement isabig help inensuring the equipment does not fail atthe crucial moment. If possible, one should fixthetiming ofthepresentation tosuit itspurpose. For example apost -lunch session isavery difficult and challenging slotaspeople tend to be sluggish. C.DELIVERY. The delivery of the presentation covers two aspects – i) the visual and ii) t he oral. The visual aspect refers tothetext and theimages used. One must ensure that theslides are attractive in terms of color, effects, images and text, for which power point packages offer agreat variety. And yet, they should notbe soattractive as to cause adistraction! Facts, figures and spellings should beaccurate aserrors when displayed on thescreen areglaringly conspicuous. The oral delivery ofthepresentation isequally oroften more important than thevisuals and itshould both compl ement and reinforce thevisuals. Careful attention should bepaid to voice modulation, correct Pronunciation, use oftones appropriate choice ofwords with pauses attheright place to emphasize apoint. Apart from thevoice body language is yet another i mportant factor ofapresentation. Research and experience have proved that the speaker‘s posture, gestures, facial expression and dressing, impact anaudience asmuch or more than thecontent and delivery ofspeech. For formal presentations, isitforbusiness or at aformal gathering, formal dressing isbest suited? The clothes should beabove allcomfortable and complement the speaker, notdistract the audience. Practice would instill confidence and poise whereas nervousness would bevisible intheabsen ceofa natural ease and asmile. Eye contact isavery important feature ofany interface. It makes each person inthe audience feel asense of inclusiveness and helps the speaker judge the instant feedback from thefacial expressions ofthelisteners. Italso acts asapowerful deterrent tothose who are fidgety and likely tocause disturbance. Agood speaker has tomake a conscious effort inthebeginning tomake eyecontact with all sections and with experience this may happen naturally. Often, beginn erstend tobenervous and edgy. Butpractice and rehearsal before friends, oreven bef ore amirror in5 privacy, goes along way indeveloping confidence. Italso helps inmaking aconscious effort tobreathe deep just before delivery, inorder todispel nervousness. Last, and certainly nottheleast, one must remember that a generous dose ofHUMOUR isasignificant and essential part ofanygood presentation. When thetopics areheavy or with alotofcomplex matter, humour not only provides a necessary relief butthevariation enables theaudience togo back tothe topic easily. Apresentation peppered with humorous anecdotes orquotations often leaves an indelible mark inthememory ofthelisteners! A.) Evaluating your presentation: A checklist.

Introduction. Shahrukh Khan goes for 6pack abs. Amir Khan upto8pack abs.6 Leena Mogre opens her hi -style gym. Fitness First opens in Oshivara. Cloud 9 opens its 9 thoutlet in Bandra. Respected judges, profess orsand friends, Are allthese a symbol ofarising and shining India? Yes, but much more, they asign ofthechanging times, anincreasingly body and health conscious people ofafast developing country India. 1.Friends you must beaware that with ahappy rising GDP and asatisfying soaring sensex there isalso adistressing increase insuicides, hyper tension, diabetes, depression and heart ailments. Infact ithas been predicted that India willbethediabetes capital oftheworld. And who orwhat is to beblamed for this state ofaffairs? Notjust the nature of thefast-paced modern life but also thewrong health habits ofthepeople. 2.Life onthefast track has itsown advantages and pitfalls. Today‘s youth isfocused and inahurry toachieve success. One may get agood job, income, lifestyle and all the trappings ofsuccess, butatwhat cost? They have little time tosavour the little pleasures oflife, The result islong working hours, lack ofsleep, stress and hyper tension. Surely lifeisnotallabout financial security and professional success alone? One needs good health toenjoy thefruits of success. 3.Itisnotuncommon orstrange that practically everyday newspapers and other media areadvocating theimportance ofexercise and right diet. Exe rcise istothebody what active usage istoany machine. Take theexample ofany car ora sewing machine that isnot put touseforacouple ofmonths. Itisbutnatural that after acouple ofmonths ofdisuse the car‘s battery would have discharged, themachinery rusted orclogged. Butarunning machine would beinexcellent form giving peak performance with anoccasional servicing. 4Similarly the mind too gets sharper and more effective with mental exercise and training aswell asright thinking. Sotoo the spirit and soul ofman would bemore receptive toawareness and acceptance ofdivine grace when kept ingood shape with the spiritual exercise of prayer, meditation and fasting. 5.The benefits ofexercise aremanifold. Anexercised body isready forpeak performance because it is energetic. A person has greater stamina. Itincreases heart rate and blood supply toall the parts ofthebody. Exercise releases7 endorphins which impart tothe body aheightened awareness and asense ofwellbeing as well as alertness. Itengenders thevalue ofself-discipline and hard work. Itmakes one focused and sure and determined. The sense ofwell being makes aperson cheerful and enthusiastic. These qualities are key drivers inaperson‘s attitude to work and relationships. Such anindividual would also bepositive, easy toget along with and anactive contributor tosociety. 6.Having said that weneed toconsider thedifferent ways of bodily exercise. The modern world offers arich variety of ways. There are ofcourse the modern gyms which have become sopopular. There are the older variations ofthe humble home grown gyms, thevyayamshalasandthe akharas.Thepoleclimbing and wrestling and boxing as much asthekarate and thejudo are other forms ofboth exercise, sport and body fitness combined. There isour very own Yoga, now aninternationally renowned form ofboth mental and physical fitness. But what about thecheapest and commonest form offitness and exercise that any one canuse? Why it is the the simplest walking and jogging or running. No need ofspending hefty amounts infashionable gyms ortraining schools. Any one can walk orgradually progress torunasmall stretch oftheroad. This explains the popularity ofthepubl icparks with running tracks and tracks forwalking. They are the popu larNana Naniparks and friends ifyou notice there arepeople ofallages and sizes and shapes, notjustgrandparentsandoldies.Evenifthe parks arenamed forthem! This also expla insthepopularity ofthe oldadage:Aftersuppe rrestawhile,afterdinner walk amile. Ofcourse one doesn‘t advocate running after dinner. Also observe how the doctors are all always advising people towalk everyday for at least half anhour daily. A brisk walk oraslow run are what can dowonders, and allat nocost! 7.The Marathons are yet another feature that explain the popularity ofrunning. Watch how young and old have all enthusiastically taken toitand not just inIndia butallover theworld. They have also helped focus attention onacause and helped multinational and national companies contribute their bit by demonstrating corporate responsibility. And so inconclusion friends Ican only stress the importance of running tomake your lifelonger, healthier and happ ierby saying:Keepawaystrife,TakeyourwifeandRunforyour Life.8 B)The ( OHP ) ---the Over -Head Projector The OHP or the Over -Head Projector is another popular tool used for making presentations where the computer facility for a power - point presentation (PPT) is not possible. It is a low cost alternative affording an interactive environment, especially to educators. The OHP consists of a large box containing a very bright lamp and a fan to cool it, on top of whi ch is a large lens. Above the box extends an arm with a mirror at its end. The lens focuses and redirects the light forward instead of up above. Transparencies (sheets of thick transparent plastic, with the matter to be projected either printed or written on it) are placed on top of the lens for display. The light from the lamp travels through the transparency and on the mirror, where it is shone for display. The mirror allows both the presenter and the audience to see the image at the same time, the pres enter looking down at the OHP top and the audience at the screen. The height of the mirror is adjustable to help focus the image on the screen. The advantage of the OHP is that it is portable (though it is heavy!) and the transparencies, once prepared, ca n be put to repeated use and can be easily carried and preserved. They can be used to photo -copy text and illustrations, in colour or in black, and when it9 is not possible to photo -copy one can write and illustrate oneself, using the special markers or pen s. As in a ppt, care should be taken that the text is not in small font or detailed. Only bold font size should be used in outline or point - form. The same attention, as for a ppt, should be paid namely , correctness, the correct order, (preferably numbered ), attractiveness, (notdistraction) , and clear visibility. C)The Use ofVisual Aids and Graphics. The success ofanycommunication depends not only onhow one accesses information and organized it,butalso onhow well one presents it.Inorder to make amessage , or a presentation orareport more comprehensible ,graphics or visual aids areused. In this section, students will learn the importance and effective use of visual aids that will help them in making effective presentations oral and written. Comm only used visual aids are tables, bar charts, line-charts, pie charts, maps, flowcharts, diagrams and photographs. Why are the visual aids used? 1.Visual aids are used tosimplify thematter. Complicated data canbesimplified with the help ofconceptual mo dels, diagrams, and charts. 2.Visual aids clarify numerical information, procedures, trends. 3.They areused toemphasize, toimpress and toattract the attention ofthereceiver. 4.They areused tosummarise thedata. 5.They are used toestablish linkage orunity indiverse points. 6.Their impact islong lasting. Types ofVisual Aids. 1.Tables: Tables include vertical columns and horizontal rows. Facts and figures could bepresented with thehelp of tables. Tables are good for precise numerical data. However, they a re tedious to prepare. For e.g:10 Combined First –Year Cost For Four Sites Locations Cost (in Rs.) Kandivali Borivali Dahisar Miraroad Lease 90,000 95,000 80,000 75,000 Property Tax 20,000 20,000 18,000 13,000 Maintenance 20,000 20,000 15,000 13,000 Transportation 50,000 50,000 60,000 60,000 Total 1,80,000 1,85,000 1,73,000 1,61,000 2.Simple Bar Chart : These are used for quantities or growth over a period of time. For e.g.: 3.Multiple Range Bar Chart/ Diagram. : These make use of vertical and horizo ntal axis. They can besegmented aswell as clustered. These are generally used to depict proportional relationships and comparisons. They are often incorrectly drawn and lead to lack of clarity. For e.g.: Line Chart :These make use ofvertical and horizontal axis. One hastousetheright scale topresent thedata. These are generally used fordepicting trends. However, too many lines canbecome very confusing. Fore.g.:11 5.PieChart :Asthe name indicates, itlooks like apie and itsdivisions look like the slices ofthe pie. Itis effectively used formaking quantitative analysis orforthe presentation oftechnical data. Use ofcolours makes the presentation attractive. Itisbest used foremphasizing a comparative data. For e.g.: 6.Flow Charts: Flow charts are easy tounderstand diagrams that convey information step bystep. 1st Qtr 2nd Qtr 3rdQtr 4thQtr 12 7.Organizational Charts: These areused todisplay physical orconceptual relationships rather than numerica lones. For e.g.: These apart, transparencies, sketches, maps, pictograms, posters, films are the commonly used forms of visual aids.

Itallows agroup toexchange thoughts and ideas among themselves. GD helps theorganization getan idea about candidates ina short time and assess those skills, which normally cannot be evaluated inaninterview. Agroup discussion generally follows awritten test. Inthis method, agroup ofcandidates isgiven atopic orasituation and asked to discuss itamong themselves for not mo rethan half anhour. Anideal group for GDconsists of8-10candidates, though figures may vary depending onthesituation. Companies conduct group discussions after thewritten test (which checks the candidate‘s technical and conceptual skills) tochec kthecandidate‘s interactive and interpersonal skills. The GD attempts toassess candidate‘s behaviour, teamwork, leadership skills, initiative, confidence, listening skills, and open -mindedness inaccepting contrary opinions, and participation and contri bution inagroup. The focus ofa GDisthus on verbal communicative ability non-verbal cues leadership skills persuasive skills Verbal Communicative Ability : This includes good knowledge ofthesubject athand and the power tocommunicate it inaneffective manner. Nothing can compensate forin-depth knowledge ofthesubject, though it isaherculean task tokeep oneself up-to-date onall14 possible topics. Agood reading habit with focus onvarious areas like finance, management, politics, society, sci ence, technology, sports, entertainment, etc. can help inbuilding confidence toexpress one‘s views onaparticular topic. While apositive impact can becreated bytalking forcefully and convincingly onasubject, this ispossible only when the candidat ehas enough knowledge ofthe subject under discussion. Clarity ofthought and precision ofexpression arepreferred toverbosity and irrelevant talk. One should speak asmuch asisnecessary, neither more nor less. The language must beformal, plain and simple; pedantry and jargon must be avoided. Slang, informal expressions, etc. should also be avoided. Appraisers also look for the ability to listen: the candidate‘s ability to react to the opinions of other participants. Hence, it is necessary to listen carefully to others and then react or proceed to add some more points. Non-Verbal Cues: Non-verbal cues are equally important. The importance of non-verbal cues has already been discussed intheprevious chapter onnon-verbal communication. The evaluato rwill scrutinize body language, eye contact, etc. ofthe candidates. Itistherefore essential tomaintain agood rapport with fellow participants. Non-verbal gestures, such as listening intently or nodding while appreciating someone‘s viewpoint, send across apositive message. Listening carefully can beaway ofencouraging other speaker and exhibiting leadership skills aswell. Participants must communicate with each and every candidate present. While speaking one must not look atonly asingle member, andespecially notattheevaluator. Body language says alot about theindividual -one‘s gestures and mannerisms are more likely toreflect one‘s attitude than what one says. Leadership Skills: The aim ofagroup discussion isalso tojudge acandidate‘ s leadership qualities. The evaluator recedes into the background once the discussion starts. The evaluator‘s attention isonthecandidates and the manner inwhich they display tact, skill, and understanding and leadership qualities tomotivate and influe nce other candidates.15 Persuasive Skills: The evaluator also looks atthemanner inwhich acandidate convinces theother members ofthegroup, and theclarity with which thecandidate expresses his/her point ofview. The candidate should therefore bearticulate, generate ideas, notsound boring, allow others tospeak, and have the ability toadopt astand onagiven subject. Even when disagreeing with another candidate, thedisagreement must beexpressed politely. The GD Process: AGD generally consis tsofthree parts: the initiation, the body ofthe GD, and summarization/conclusion. Initiation : The candidate initiating aGDnotonly gets theopportunity to speak first but also grabs theattention oftheevaluator and his/ herfellow candidates. Ithelps if the candidate canmake afavourable first impression with his/her content and communication skills ininitiating aGD. However, ifa candidate initiates aGD and falters, itmight dent his/her chances ofmaking afavourable impression ontheevalu ator. Ifthecandidate initiates theGD clearly butremains quiet after that, s/he will end upgiving theimpression that s/he started theGDonly forthesake of starting itorgetting those initial brownie points awarded toaninitiator. Itistheinitiator‘s responsibility toputthetopic into the right perspective orframework. Soitis better to initiate aGDonly ifone has in-depth knowledge about the topic being discussed. Ifone isnot sure ofthetopic athand, it is better tolisten carefully totheviews being expressed byothers and then speak. One should notbeinahurry toexpress one‘s opinion. The Body ofDiscussion: This isthemain part oftheGDwhere all the members ofthe group express their opinions onthetopic. Candidates must restrict themselves toconveying their viewpoints and not use the GD as acontest torun down other arguments. Candidates can politely agree, disagree orchoose toremain neutral. Aspeaker should never beinterrupted while speaking. Speaking out ofturn andcutting others short create anegative impression. Too much aggression can put offprospective employers.16 While speaking, theentire group must beaddressed sothat everyone isattentive towards what isbeing said. The focus should never be on theevaluator. Toemphasize thecontent, relevant proverbs, quotes, definitions, facts and figures, statistics, etc. may beused. While using figures or statistics, itmust beremembered that macro figures may be generalized, while micro figures must bespecific. Summarization / Conclusion: Aconclusion iswhere thewhole group decides infavor of against the topic. Generally, aGD does not have a conclusion. But the discussion isalways summarized. One of thecandidates isinvited tosummarize thediscussion. This signals theend ofthe GD. The candidate must summarize all that thegroup has discussed. The following can bekept in mind while summarizing aGD: The summary must bebrief and succinct. Allimportant points discussed must beincluded. The focus must not be on the points made bythe presenter, alone. Nonew points must bestated here.
