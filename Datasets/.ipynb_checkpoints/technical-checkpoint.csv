However, the operating system (Windows) calculates the storage  device capacity assuming that 1KB=1,024 Bytes, and therefore the capacity representation of the HDD in Windows is smaller than the actual capacity due to the difference in capacity calculation. For example, for a 80GB HDD, Windows represents the capacity as 74.5GB, 80x 1,000x 1,000x 1,000 byte/(1,024x 1,024x 1,024)byte =  74.505GB. In addition, the capacity representation in Windows may be even  smaller because some programs such as Recovery may reside in a hidden area of the HDD. Memory capacity representation The memory capacity reported in Windows is less than the actual capacity of memory. This is because BIOS or a video adapter uses a portion of memory or claims it for further use. For example, for 1GB(=1,024MB) memory installed, Windows may report the capacity as 1,022MB or less.Caution for the data Samsung Electronics shall not be liable for any data loss. Please take care to avoid losing any important data and back up your data to prevent any such data loss.

If you set the resolution higher than the recommended value, it  may result in problems with some applications, due to limitations of the operating system.6 Table of contents Getting started 7 Layout 13  C onnecting the AC  adapter 16  T urning the computer on  and off 19  Unlock ing the screen Windows 20 A bout Windows 22  D esktop 23  S tart screen 25   The Charms 28   Applications 34  M icrosoft account 34  S toreBasics 35 T ouch screen (optional) 44  Keyboar d 47  T ouchpad 50  L CD brightness 52   Volume 53  S etup utility (BIOS) Network & Internet 59 W ired LAN62  W ireless LAN 64  M obile broadband   (Wireless WAN, optional)Applications 66 U sing applications67  S ettings 68  S oftware Update 69  Suppor t Center 70  S P layer+ 71  TP M security solution  (optional) External devices 81 Ex ternal CD/DVD drive83  M emory card 86  Ex ternal display 88  Slim secur ity slotTroubleshooting 89 Recover/Backup 96  W indows recovery  function 96   Q&A Appendix 101 P roduct specifications102  Er gonomic tips 106   Battery 108  S afety precautions 121  I mportant safety  information 124  R eplacement parts and  accessories 126  R egulatory compliance  statements 144  WEEE symbol inf ormation 146  S amsung package   Take-Back program 147  T CO certified   (for corresponding  models only)7 Getting started Layout •	Features or options may differ depending on the model. •	The items marked as optional may not be provided or  may be provided in different locations. •	Since some space on the SSD is reserved for system recovery and operations, the displayed capacity of the SSD may be less than the actual capacity.Front viewGetting started 8 Number/Name Description LCD /Touch screen   (optional)•	Displays the user interface. •	Recognizes touches on the screen.

"60When you want to photograph flowers or  small things up close, use the  <4> (Close-up) mode. To make sma ll things appear much larger, use a  macro lens (sold separately).  Use a simple background. A simple background makes the flower, etc., stand out better.  Move to the subject as close as possible. Check the lens for its minimum focusing distance. Some lenses  have indications such as < 40.25m/0.8ft >. The lens minimum  focusing distance is measured from the < V> (focal plane) mark on  the top left of the camera to the subject. If you are too close to the subject, the focus confirmation light < o> will blink. Under low light, the built-in flash will fire. If you are too close to the  subject and the bottom of the picture looks dark, move away from the subject.  With a zoom lens, use the telephoto end. If you have a zoom lens, using t he telephoto end will make the  subject look larger.4 Shooting Close-ups Shooting Tips COPY61To photograph a moving subject, w hether it is a child running or a  moving vehicle, use the < 5> (Sports) mode.  Use a telephoto lens. Using a telephoto lens is recommende d so you can shoot from afar.  Use the center AF point to focus. Aim the center AF point over the subject, then press the shutter  button halfway to autofocus. Duri ng autofocusing, the beeper will  continue beeping softly. If focus cannot be achieved, the focus  confirmation light < o> will blink. When you want to take the picture, press the shutter button completely. If you hold down the shut ter button, continuous shooting  (max. approx. 3 shots per sec. in  JPEG quality) and autofocusing  will take effect.5 Shooting Moving Subjects Shooting Tips Under low light when camera shake is prone to oc cur, the viewfinder’s  shutter speed display on th e bottom left will blink. Hold the camera steady  and shoot. COPY62To shoot someone at night and obtain a natural-looking exposure in the  background, use the < 6> (Night Portrait) mode.  Use a wide-angle lens and a tripod. When using a zoom lens, use the wide-angle end to obtain a wide  night view. Also, use a tri pod to prevent camera shake.  Keep the person within 5 meters/16.4 feet from the camera.Under low light, the built-in flash wi ll fire automatically to obtain a  good exposure of the person. The ma ximum effective distance of the  built-in flash is 5 meters/1 6.4 feet from the camera.  Shoot also with < 1> (Full Auto). Since camera shake is prone to occu r with night shots, shooting also  with <1> (Full Auto) is recommended.6 Shooting Portraits at Night Shooting Tips  Tell the subject to keep st ill even after the flash fires.  If you use the self-timer together with flash, the self-timer lamp will light  briefly after the picture is taken.

If you use a telephoto lens, hold it steady to prevent camera shake.  How to blur a flowing river or water fountain. Use a slow shutter speed of 1/30 sec. or slower. Use a tripod to  prevent hand-held camera shake.  Set the shutter speed so that the aperture display does not  blink in the viewfinder. If you press the shutter button halfway and change the shutter speed while the aperture is displayed,  the aperture display will also change to maintain the  same exposure (amount of light reaching the image sensor). If you exceed the adjustable aperture  range, the aperture display will blink to indicate that  the standard exposure cannot be obtained.If the exposure will be too dark, the maximum aperture (smallest  number) will blink. If this happens, turn the < 6> dial to the left to  set a slower shutter speed or increase the ISO speed. If the exposure will be too bright, the minimum aperture (highest  number) will blink. If this happens, turn the < 6> dial to the right to  set a faster shutter speed or decrease the ISO speed. To obtain a correct flash expos ure, the flash output will be set  automatically (autoflash exposure)  to match the automatically-set  aperture. The flash sync speed can be set from 1/200 sec. to 30 sec.Shooting Tips I Using the Built-in Flash COPY94To blur the background or to make everything near and far look sharp,  set the Mode Dial to < f> (Aperture-priority AE) to adjust the depth of  field (range of acceptable focus). * <f> stands for Aperture value wh ich is the size of  the diaphragm ho le inside the lens . 1Set the Mode Dial to < f>. 2Set the desired aperture.  The higher the f/number, the wider  the depth of field where sharper focus  is obtained in both the foreground  and background.  Turning the <6> dial to the right will  set a higher f/number (smaller aperture opening), and turning it to the left will set a lower f/number  (larger aperture opening). 3Take the picture.  Focus and press the shutter button completely. The picture will be taken  with the selected aperture.f: Changing the Depth of Field Sharp foreground and background (With a high aperture f/number: f/32) Blurred background (With a low aperture f/number: f/5.6) Aperture Display The higher the f/number, the smaller the aperture  opening will be. The  apertures displayed will differ  depending on the lens. If no lens is attached to  the camera, “ 00” will be displayed for the aperture. COPY95f: Changing the Depth of Field  When using an aperture with a high f/number, note that camera  shake can occur in low light scenes. A higher aperture f/number will ma ke the shutter speed slower.  Under low light, the shutter speed ca n be as long as 30 sec. In such  cases, increase the ISO speed and hol d the camera steady or use a  tripod.  The depth of field depends not onl y on the aperture, but also on  the lens and on the subject distance.Since wide-angle lenses have a wide depth of field (range of  acceptable focus in front of and beh ind the point of focus), you need  not set a high aperture f/number to obtain a sharp picture from the  foreground to the background. On the other hand, a telephoto lens has a narrow depth of field. And the closer the subject, the narro wer the depth of field. A farther  subject will have a wider depth of field.  Set the aperture so that the shutter speed display does not  blink.If you press the shutter button halfway and change  the aperture while the shutter speed is displayed, the shutter speed display will also change to maintain the same exposure (amount of light  reaching the image sensor). If you exceed the  adjustable shutter speed range, the shutter speed  display will blink to indicate that the standard exposure cannot be obtained.If the picture will be too dark, the “ 30""” (30 sec.) shutter speed  display will blink. If th is happens, turn the < 6> dial to the left to set  a lower aperture f/number or increase the ISO speed.If the picture will be too bright, the “ 4000 ” (1/4000 sec.) shutter  speed display will blink. If this happens, turn the < 6> dial to the  right to set a higher aperture f/number or decrease the ISO speed.Shooting Tips COPYf: Changing the Depth of Field 96To obtain a correct flash expos ure, the flash output will be set  automatically to match the set a perture (autoflash exposure). The  shutter speed will be set automatically between 1/200 sec. - 30 sec. to  suit the scene’s brightness. In low light, the main subject is ex posed with the automatic flash, and  the background is exposed with a slow  shutter speed set automatically.  Both the subject and background look properly exposed (automatic slow-speed flash sync). If you ar e handholding the camera, keep it  steady to prevent camera shake. Using a tripod is recommended. If you do not want a slow s hutter speed to be used, set [ 2: Flash sync.  speed in Av mode] to [ 1: 1/200-1/60 sec. auto ] or [2: 1/200 sec.  (fixed) ] in [7  Custom Functions (C.Fn) ] (p.218). The aperture opening (diaphragm) changes only at the moment when  the picture is taken. Otherwise, the aperture remains fully open.  Therefore, when you look at the scene through the viewfinder or LCD  monitor, the depth of field will look narrow. With the procedure below, you can check the depth of field before taking the picture. 1 Enable depth-of-field preview to be used.  Under [7  Custom Functions (C.Fn)], set [ 8: Assign SET  button] to [5: Depth-of-field preview ] (p.222).  For details about Custom F unction settings, see page 216. 2 Exit the menu.  Press the <M > button two times to exit the menu. 3 Press <0>. XThe aperture will be stopped down so you can see the depth of field.I Using the Built-in Flash 3  Depth of Field Preview N While looking at the Live View im age (p.122) and holding down the < 0>  button, you can change the aperture  and see how the depth of field  changes. COPY97You can set both the shutter speed and aperture manually as desired.  While referring to the exposure level indicator in the viewfinder, you can  set the exposure as desired. This method is called manual exposure. * <a> stands for Manual. 1Set the Mode Dial to < a>. 2Set the shutter speed and  aperture.  To set the shutter speed, turn the  <6> dial.  To set the aperture, hold down the  <O > button and turn the < 6> dial. 3Focus the subject.  Press the shutter button halfway. XThe exposure setting will be displayed in the viewfinder.   The exposure level mark < h> indicates  how far the current exposure level is from the standard exposure level. 4Set the exposure and take the  picture.  Set the shutter speed and aperture as  desired.  If the exposure set exceeds ±2 stops from the standard exposure, the end of the exposure level indi cator will display < I>  or <J> in the viewfinder.

The flash sync speed can be set fr om 1/200 sec. to 30 sec. and bulb. A bulb exposure keeps the shutter open  for as long as you hold down the shutter  button. It can be used to photograph  fireworks, etc.In step 2 on the preceding page, turn the  <6> dial to the left to set < BULB >.  The elapsed exposure time will be  displayed on the LCD monitor.I Using the Built-in Flash BULB: Bulb Exposures Elapsed exposure time  During bulb exposures, do not point the lens to ward the sun. The sun’s  heat can damage the camera ’s internal components.  Since bulb exposures produce more noise than usual, the image might  look a little grainy.  You can reduce the noise due to  long exposures by setting [ 3: Long exp.  noise reduction ] to [1: Auto ] or [2: On ] in the [7 Custom Functions  (C.Fn) ] (p.219). For bulb exposures, using a tripod and Remote Switch (sold separately,  p.229) is recommended. COPY99Objects in the foreground and backgro und will be in focus automatically.  All the AF points will function to  detect the subject, and the aperture  required to attain the necessary dept h of field will be set automatically. * <8 > stands for Auto-Depth of field. This mode se ts the depth of field  automatically. 1Set the Mode Dial to < 8 >. 2Focus the subject.  Aim the AF points over the subjects  and press the shutter button halfway  (0).  All the subjects covered by the AF  points flashing in red will be in focus.  If focus is not achieved, the picture cannot be taken. 3Take the picture.  The aperture display in the viewfinder blinks.The exposure is correct, but the desired depth of field cannot be  obtained. Either use a wide-angle lens  or move farther away from  the subjects.  The shutter speed display in the viewfinder blinks. If the “ 30""” shutter speed blinks, it means that the subject is too dark.  Increase the ISO speed. If the “ 4000 ” shutter speed blinks, it means  that the subject is too bright. Decrease the ISO speed.  A slow shutter speed has been set. Use a tripod to st eady the camera.  I want to use flash.Flash can be used, however, the result will be the same as using the  <d> mode with flash. The desired depth of field will not be obtained.8 : Automatic Depth-of-Field AE FAQ COPY100Three methods (metering modes) to measure the subject’s brightness  are provided.

If you continue sh ooting while this icon is displayed, the image  quality of still photos may deteriora te. You should stop the Live View  shooting and allow the camera to cool down before shooting again.  If the camera’s internal temperatu re further increases while the white  <s> icon is displayed, a red <E > icon will start blinking. This blinking  icon is a warning that the Live View  shooting will soon be terminated  automatically. If this happens, you will not be able to sh oot again until the  camera’s internal temperature decrea ses. Turn off the power and let the  camera rest for a while.  Shooting with the Live View func tion at a high temperature for a  prolonged period will cause the < s> and <E> icons to appear earlier.  When not shooting, tu rn off the camera. Live View Image Cautions  Under low- or bright-light conditio ns, the Live View image might not  reflect the brightness of the captured image.  If the light source within the image changes, the screen  might flicker. If  this happens, stop the Live View shooting and resume shooting under  the actual light so urce to be used.  If you point the camera in  a different direction, it  might throw off the Live  View image’s correct brightness mo mentarily. Wait until the brightness  level stabilizes be fore shooting.  If there is a very bright light source in the pictur e, such as the sun, the  bright area might appear black on the LCD monitor.  However, the actual  captured image will correc tly show the bright area.  In low light, if you set the [ 6 LCD brightness ] to a bright setting,  chrominance noise may appear in th e Live View image. However, the  chrominance noise will not be recorded in the captured image.  When you magnify the image, the image sharpness may look more  pronounced than it really is. COPY137Live View Shooting Cautions Shooting Result Cautions  When you shoot continuous ly with the Live View  function for a long  period, the camera’s internal temp erature may increase and it can  degrade image quality. Terminate Live  View shooting when not shooting  images.  Before taking a long exposure, stop Live View shooting temporarily and  wait several minutes before shoo ting. This is to prevent image  degradation.  Live View shooting in high temperatures and at high ISO speeds may  cause noise or irregular colors.  When you shoot at high ISO speeds, noise (banding, dots of light, etc.)  may become noticeable.  If you take the picture during magn ified view, the exposure might not  come out as desired. Return to the n ormal view before taking the picture.  During the magnified vi ew, the shutter speed and aperture will be  displayed in orange. Even  if you take the pictur e during magnified view,  the image will be captured in the normal view.  If [2 Auto Lighting Optimizer ] (p.107) is not set to [ Disable ], the  image may look bright ev en if a decreased expo sure compensation or  decreased flash exposure co mpensation has been set.  If you use a TS-E lens to shift the lens vertic ally or use an Extension  Tube, the standard exposure might not be obtained or an irregular exposure may result. Custom Function Cautions  During Live View shooting, certain Cu stom Function settings will not take  effect (p.217). Lens and Flash Cautions  The focus preset featur e on super telephoto le nses cannot be used.  FE lock is not possible when the built -in flash or an external Speedlite is  used.

The horizontal axis  indicates the brightness level (darker on the left and brighter on the right), while the vertical axis indicates  how many pixels exist for each brightness level. The  more pixels there are toward the left, the darker the image. And the more pixels there are toward the right,  the brighter the image. If ther e are too many pixels on  the left, the shadow detail will  be lost. And if there are  too many pixels on the righ t, the highlight detail will be  lost. The gradation in-between  will be reproduced. By  checking the image and its brightness histogram, you can see the exposure level incli nation and the overall gradation. [RGB] Display This histogram is a graph showing the di stribution of each primary color’s  brightness level in the image (RGB or  red, green, and blue). The horizontal  axis indicates the color’s brightness le vel (darker on the left and brighter on  the right), while the vertical axis indicates how many pixels exist for each color brightness level. The more pixels there are toward the left, the darker  and less prominent the colo r. And the more pixels t here are toward the right,  the brighter and denser the co lor. If there are too many pixels on the left, the  respective color information will be lack ing. And if there are too many pixels  on the right, the color will be too saturated with no detail.

C.Fn-2 Flash sync. speed in Av mode When you use flash in the aperture-priority AE mode ( f), you can set the  flash sync speed. 0: Auto The flash sync speed is set automatic ally within a range of 1/200 sec. to  30 sec. to suit the scene’s brightne ss. With an external Speedlite, high- speed sync will also be possible. 1: 1/200-1/60 sec. auto Prevents a slow shutter speed from being set in low-light conditions. It is  effective for preventing subject blur and camera shake.  However, while  the subject will be properly exposed with the flash, the background may  come out dark. 2: 1/200 sec. (fixed) The flash-sync speed is fixed to 1/ 200 sec. This more effectively  prevents subject blur and camera shake than with setting 1. However, the background may come out darker than with setting 1.With setting 1, the exposure  level will be displayed in the viewfinder and on  the LCD monitor as shown below. When 1 or 2 is set, high -speed sync cannot be used with an external  Speedlite. COPY2193  Custom Function Settings N C.Fn II: Image C.Fn-3 Long exposure noise reduction 0: Off 1: Auto For 1 sec. or longer exposure s, noise reduction is performed  automatically if noise typical of lo ng exposures is detected. This [ Auto ]  setting is effective in most cases. 2: On Noise reduction is performed for all ex posures of 1 sec. or longer. The  [On] setting may be effective for no ise that cannot be detected or  reduced with the [Auto ] setting. C.Fn-4 High ISO speed noise reduction Reduces the noise generated in the image. Although noise reduction is  applied at all ISO speeds, it is particul arly effective at high ISO speeds. At  low ISO speeds, the noise in the shad ow areas is further reduced. Change  the setting to suit the noise level. 0: Standard 2: Strong 1: Low 3: Disable With settings 1 and 2, th e continuous shooting spee d will be slower even  with shutter speeds faster than 1 se c. (with the image- recording quality  set to JPEG). The maximum burst duri ng continuous shooting will also  decrease (with the image- recording quality set to JPEG). Settings 1 and  2 are recommended only when  shooting long exposures.  With settings 1 and 2, after the pict ure is taken, the noise reduction  process may take the same amount of  time as the exposure. You cannot  take another picture until the nois e reduction process is completed.  At ISO 1600 and higher, noise might be more pronounc ed with setting 2  than with setting 0 or 1.  With setting 1 or 2, if a long exposure is shot with the Live View image  displayed, “ BUSY ” will be displayed during th e noise reduction process.  The Live View display will not ap pear until the noise reduction is  completed. (You cannot take another picture.) COPY3  Custom Function Settings N 220C.Fn-5 Highlight tone priority 0: Disable 1: Enable Improves the highlight detail. The dynamic range is expanded from the  standard 18% gray to bright highli ghts. The gradation between the grays  and highlights becomes smoother. C.Fn III: Autofocus/Drive C.Fn-6 AF-assist beam firing The AF-assist beam can be emitted by t he camera’s built-in flash or by an  external, EOS-dedicated Speedlite. 0: Enable If necessary, the AF-assist beam will be emitted by the built-in flash or  external Speedlite. 1: Disable The AF-assist beam is not emitted. With setting 2, the continuous shooti ng speed will be slower (with the  image-recording qualit y set to JPEG or 1+73 ). The maximum burst  during continuous shooting will also  decrease (with the image-recording  quality set to JPEG or 1).  If you playback a 1 or 1+73 image with the ca mera or print an  image directly, the effect of the high  ISO speed noise reduction may look  minimal. You can check the noise reduc tion effect or print noise-reduced  images with Digital Photo Professi onal (provided software, p.270).  With setting 1, the Auto Lighting Opti mizer (p.107) is au tomatically set to  [Disable ] and the setting cannot be changed.  With setting 1, noise ma y become slightly more  pronounced than with  setting 0. With setting 1, the settable range will be ISO 200 - 6400. Also, the <A > icon will be displayed on the LCD monitor and in the  viewfinder when highlight to ne priority is enabled. COPY2213  Custom Function Settings N 2: Enable external flash only If an external Speedlite is attached,  it will emit the AF-assist beam when  necessary. The camera’s built-in flash will not fire the AF-assist beam. 3: IR AF assist beam only Among external Speedlites, only thos e which have an infrared AF-assist  beam will be able to emit the beam. This prevents any Speedlite which  uses a series of small flashes (like the built-in flash) from firing the AF- assist beam. With an EX-series Speedl ite equipped with a LED li ght, the LED light will  not automatically turn on for AF-assist. C.Fn IV: Operation/Others C.Fn-7 Shutter/AE lock button 0: AF/AE lock 1: AE lock/AF Convenient when you want to focu s and meter separately. Press the  <A> button to autofocus, and press the shutter button halfway to apply  AE lock. 2: AF/AF lock, no AE lock In the AI Servo AF mode, you can press the < A> button to stop the AF  operation momentarily. This prevents the AF from being thrown off by  any obstacle passing between the came ra and subject. The exposure is  set at the moment the picture is taken. 3: AE/AF, no AE lock This is useful for subjects which keep moving and stopping repeatedly.  In the AI Servo AF mode, you can press the <A > button to start or stop  the AI Servo AF operation. The ex posure is set at the moment the  picture is taken. Thus, the opti mum focusing and exposure will always  be achieved as you wait for the decisive moment.If the external Speedlite’s [ AF-assist beam firing ] Custom Function is set  to [Disabled ], the Speedlite will not emit th e AF-assist beam even if the  camera’s C.Fn-6 is set to 0, 2, or 3.

When an EX-series Speedlite (sold separately) is attached to the camera, almost all the autoflash cont rol is done by the camera. In other  words, it is like a high-output flash attached externally in place of the  built-in flash. For detailed instructions, see the EX-series Speedlite’s instruction  manual. This camera is a Type-A camera that can use all the features of EX-series Speedlites.External Speedlites EOS-dedicated, EX-series Speedlites Shoe-mount Speedlites Macro Lites  With an EX-series Speedlite not compatible with flash function settings  (p.167), only [ Flash exp. comp ] and [ E-TTL II meter. ] can be set for  [External flash func. setting ]. (Certain EX-series Speedlites also  enable [ Shutter sync.] to be set.)  If flash exposure compensation is se t with the external Speedlite, the  flash exposure compensation icon displayed on the camera’s LCD  monitor will change from y  to 0.  If the Speedlite’s Custom Function has the flash meteri ng mode set to  TTL autoflash, the flash will  fire at full output only. COPY227External Speedlites  With an EZ/E/EG/ML/TL-series Speedlite set in TTL or A-TTL  autoflash mode, the flash can be  fired at full output only. Set the camera’s shooting mode to < a> (manual exposure) or  <f> (aperture-priority AE) and adjust the aperture setting before  shooting.  If you are using a Speedlite which has manual flash mode, shoot in  the manual flash mode. Sync Speed The camera can synchronize with compact, non-Canon flash units at  1/200 sec. or slower shutter s peeds. Use a sync speed slower than  1/200 sec. Be sure to test the flash unit befor ehand to make sure it synchronizes  properly with the camera.Canon Speedlites other than the EX-series Using Non-Canon Flash Units  If the camera is used with a flash unit or flash accessory dedicated to  another camera brand,  the camera may not operate properly and  malfunction may result.  Do not attach a high-voltage flash un it on the camera’s hot shoe. It might  not fire. COPY228With the AC Adapter Kit ACK-E10 (sold separately), you can connect  the camera to a household power outlet and not worry about the  remaining battery level. 1Connect the power cord.

COPY242If a problem occurs with the camera, first refer to this Troubleshooting  Guide. If this Troubleshooting Guide does not resolve the problem,  contact your dealer or nearest Canon Service Center.  Do not recharge any battery pack ot her than a genuine Canon Battery  Pack LP-E10.  If there is a problem with the battery charger, the protective circuit will stop  the charging operation and the charge la mp will blink in orange. If this  happens, disconnect the charger’s powe r plug from the power outlet and  remove the battery pack. Attach the battery pack to t he charger again and  wait a while before connecting the charger to a power outlet again.  Make sure the card/battery compartment cover is closed (p.28).  The battery is not properly installed in the camera (p.28).  Recharge the battery (p.26).  Press the <B> button (p.46).  If the power is turned off while an im age is being recorded to the card,  the access lamp will still continue to light/blink for a few seconds.  When the image recording is comple ted, the power will turn off  automatically.  Use a fully-charged battery pack (p.26).  The rechargeable battery pack performance will degrade over  repeated use. Purchase a new one.Troubleshooting Guide Power-Related Problems The battery pack does not recharge. The battery charger’s lamp blinks. The camera does not operate even when  the power switch is set to < 1>. The access lamp still blinks even when the power switch is set to < 2 >. The battery becomes exhausted quickly. COPY243Troubleshooting Guide  If you use Live View shooting or shoot movies for a prolonged period  (p.121, 139), the number of possible shots will decrease.  If you hold down the shutter button for a long time or often use only the  AF without taking pictures, the number of possible shots will decrease.  If you often use the LCD monitor, the number of possible shots will  decrease.  If you use the lens Image Stabilizer,  the number of possible shots will  decrease.  Auto power off is in effect. If you do not want auto power off to take  effect, set [5 Auto power off ] to [Off] (p.155).  Even if [5 Auto power off ] has been set to [ Off], the LCD monitor will  still turn off after the camera is  idle for 30 min. Press the < B >  button to turn on the LCD monitor.  The card is not properly inserted (p.28).  If the card is full, replace the card or delete unnecessary images to  make room (p.28, 196).  If you try to focus in the One- Shot AF mode while the focus  confirmation light < o> in the viewfinder blin ks, a picture cannot be  taken. Press the shutter button hal fway again to focus, or focus  manually (p.39, 85).  Slide the card’s write-protect switch  to the Write/Erase setting (p.28).  If a card error me ssage is displayed, see page 30 or 250.The camera turns off by itself. Shooting-Related Problems No images can be shot nor recorded. The card cannot be used. COPYTroubleshooting Guide 244 If the card already contains re corded images, the image number might  not start from 0001 (p.158).  Set the lens focus mode switch to < AF> (p.35).  To prevent camera shake, press t he shutter button gently (p.38, 39).  If the lens has an Image Stabiliz er, set the IS switch to < 1>.  In low light, the shutter speed may become slow. Use a faster shutter speed  (p.92), set a higher ISO speed (p.77), use flash (p.88), or use a tripod.  Horizontal stripes or irregular expos ures can be caused by fluorescent  light, LED bulbs, or other artificial  lighting during viewfinder or Live  View shooting. Also, the exposure or color tone might not come out  right. A slow shutter s peed may solve the problem.  Under [7 Custom Functions (C.Fn) ], if [3: Long exposure noise  reduction ] is set to [ 0: Off ] and [ 4: High ISO speed noise reduction ]  to any setting other than [ 2: Strong ], the continuous shooting speed  will return to normal. The maximu m burst during continuous shooting  will also return to normal.  If you shoot something that has fine detail (field of grass, etc.), the file size will be larger and the actual  maximum burst might be lower than  the number ment ioned on page 74.  Under [7 Custom Functions (C.Fn) ], if [5: Highlight tone priority ]  is set to [ 1: Enable ], ISO 100 cannot be set. If [ 0: Disable ] is set, ISO  100 can be set (p.220).The file numbering doe s not start from 0001. The image is out of focus. Horizontal stripes appear, or th e exposure or color tone look  strange. The continuous shooting speed is slower./ The maximum burst during c ontinuous shooting is lower. ISO 100 cannot be set. COPY245Troubleshooting Guide  Under the [7 Custom Functions (C.Fn)] menu, if [ 5: Highlight tone  priority ] is set to [ 1: Enable ], the Auto Lighting Optimizer cannot be  set. If [ 0: Disable] is set, the Auto Light ing Optimizer can be set  (p.107).  If you shoot at night when the backg round is dark, the shutter speed  becomes slow automatically (slow- sync shooting) so that both the  subject and background are properly exposed. If you do not want a  slow shutter speed to be set, set [ 2: Flash sync. speed in Av mode ]  in [7 Custom Functions (C.Fn) ] to 1 or 2 (p.218).  In the 1, 2, 4 , and 6 modes, the built-in flash will pop-up  automatically when fl ash is necessary.  If you shoot continuously with the built-in flash at  short intervals, the  flash might stop operating to protect the flash unit.  If flash exposure compensation has bee n set on an external Speedlite,  [Flash exp. comp ] (p.169) cannot be set in the [ External flash func.  setting ] screen. Also, if you set flash exposure compensation with the  camera and then set flash exposure compensation with the external  Speedlite, the Speedlite’s flash exposure compensation setting will  override the camera’s. When the Speedlite’s flash exposure  compensation is canceled, flash exposure compensation can be set  with the camera.The Auto Lighting Optimizer cannot be set. When I use the < f> mode with flash, the sh utter speed becomes slow. The built-in flash pops up by itself. The built-in flash does not fire. I cannot set flash exposure compensation with [External  flash func. setting]. COPYTroubleshooting Guide 246 Under [7 Custom Functions (C.Fn) ], set [2: Flash sync. speed in  Av mode ] to [0: Auto ] (p.218).  The built-in flash’s pop-up mechanism  moves slightly. This is normal.  If you use flash, the shutter will ma ke two sounds eac h time you shoot  (p.123).  It indicates that the camera’s inte rnal temperature is high. If the < s>  icon is white, the still photo’s image  quality might deteriorate. If the  <E> icon is red, it indicates that t he Live View or movie shooting will  soon be terminated automatically (p.136, 150).  If the card’s writing speed is  slow, movie shooting may stop  automatically. Use an SD Speed Class 6 “ ” or faster card. To  find out the card’s read/ write speed, see the card manufacturer’s Web  site, etc.  If a movie clip’s file size reaches  4 GB or the shooting length reaches  29 min. 59 sec., the movie shoot ing will stop automatically.  Flickering, horizontal stripes (noise ), or irregular exposures can be  caused by fluorescent light, LED bulbs, or other artificial lighting during movie shooting. Also, changes in t he exposure (brightness) or color  tone might also be recorded.High-speed sync cannot be set in the < f> mode. The camera makes a noise when it is shaken. The shutter makes two shooting s ounds during Live View shooting. During Live View shooting and movie shooting, the E icon appears. Movie shooting terminates by itself. The image flickers or horizont al stripes appear during movie  shooting. COPY247Troubleshooting Guide  If the LCD monitor is dirty, use a soft cloth to clean it.  In low or high temperatures, the LCD monitor display may seem slow  or might look black. It will retu rn to normal at room temperature.  It is the highlight alert (p.200). Ov erexposed highlight areas with a loss  of highlight detail will blink.  If the image has been protected, it cannot be erased (p.194).  Movies edited with a personal computer using the provided  ZoomBrowser EX/ImageBrowser (p.270) or other software cannot be played with the camera.  If you operate the camera’s dials or  lens during movi e shooting, the  operation noise will also be recorded.  If there is a drastic change in t he exposure during movie shooting, the  autoexposure stops the recording momentarily until the exposure  stabilizes.  If you move the camera to the left or right quickly (high-speed panning)  or shoot a moving subject, t he image may look distorted.Playback Problems The LCD monitor does not display a clear image. Part of the image blinks in black. The image cannot be erased. The movie cannot play. When the movie is played, camera  operation noise can be heard. The movie has still moments. The subject looks distorted during movie shooting. COPYTroubleshooting Guide 248 An HDMI cable (sold separately) is  necessary to connect the camera  to a TV set. Using t he HDMI Cable HTC-100 (sold separately) is  recommended (p.191).  Also check that your TV set has an HDMI IN terminal. If the TV set  does not have an HDMI IN terminal and has only an A/ V IN jack, the  camera cannot be connected.  Make sure the HDMI cable’s plug is  inserted all the way in (p.191).  Using HDMI Cable HTC-100 (sold separately) is recommended  (p.191).  Depending on the card reader and com puter OS used, SDXC cards  might not be correctly recognized . In such a case, connect your  camera to the computer with t he provided interface cable, then  transfer the images to your com puter using EOS Ut ility (provided  software, p.270).  In Basic Zone modes and in movie shooting mode, certain tabs and  menu options are not displayed. Set the shooting mode to a Creative  Zone mode (p.42).  Set the color space to sRGB. If Adobe RGB is set, the first character  will be an underscore (p.119).I cannot connect the ca mera to my TV set. No image appears on the TV screen. My card reader does not recognize the card. Display Problems The menu screen shows few tabs and options. The file name’s first character is an underscore (“_MG_”). COPY249Troubleshooting Guide  It is a movie file (p.159).  The correct date and time has not been set (p.33).  The shooting date and time does not appear in the picture. The date  and time is instead recorded in the image data as shooting  information. When printing, you can imprint the date and time in the  picture by using the date and time recorded in the shooting information  (p.207).  If the card has recorded a number of images greater than the camera can display, [ ###] will be displayed (p.181).  [Eye-Fi settings ] will appear only when an Eye-Fi card is inserted into  the camera. If the Eye-Fi card has a write-protect tab set to the LOCK  position, you will not be able to che ck the card’s connection status or  disable Eye-Fi card transmission (p.230).  What is displayed on the screen diff ers depending on the printer. This  instruction manual lists all the printing effects available (p.206).The file name starts with “MVI_”. The shooting date and time displayed is incorrect. The date and time is not in the picture. [###] is displayed. [Eye-Fi settings] does not appear. Printing-Related Problems There are fewer printing effects than listed in the instruction  manual. COPY250If there is a problem with the camera, an  error message will appear.

COPY259Safety Warnings Follow these safe guards and use the eq uipment properly to pr event injury, death,  and material damage. Preventing Serious Injury or Death • To prevent fire, excessive heat, chemic al leakage, and explosions, follow the  safeguards below: - Do not use any batteries, power sources,  and accessories not specified in this  booklet. Do not use any home -made or modified batteries. - Do not short-circuit, disassemble, or modi fy the battery pack or back-up battery. Do  not apply heat or apply solder to the battery pack or back-up battery. Do not expose  the battery pack or back-up battery to fire or water. And do not subject the battery  pack or back-up battery to strong physical shock. - Do not install the battery pack or back-up battery in reversed polarity (+ –). Do not  mix new and old or different types of batteries. - Do not recharge the battery pack outside the allowable ambient temperature range  of 0°C - 40°C (32°F - 104°F). Also, do not exceed the recharging time. - Do not insert any foreign metallic objects into the electrical contacts of the camera,  accessories, connecting cables, etc. • Keep the back-up battery away from children. If a child swallows the battery, consult a  physician immediately. (Battery chemicals may harm the stomach and intestines.) • When disposing of a battery pack or back-up battery, insulate the electrical contacts  with tape to prevent contact with other metallic objects or batteries. This is to prevent  fire or an explosion. • If excessive heat, smoke, or fumes are emitted during battery pack recharging,  immediately unplug the battery charger from the power outlet to stop the recharging  and prevent a fire. • If the battery pack or back-up battery leaks, changes color, deforms, or emits smoke or  fumes, remove it immediately. Be careful not to get burned in the process. • Prevent any battery leakage from contacting your eyes, skin, and clothing. It can  cause blindness or skin problems. If the battery leakage contacts your eyes, skin, or clothing, flush the affected area with lots of clean water without rubbing it. See a  physician immediately. • During the recharging, keep the equipment away  from the reach of children. The cord  can accidentally choke the child or give an electrical shock. • Do not leave any cords near a heat source. It can deform the cord or melt the  insulation and cause a fire or electrical shock. • Do not fire the flash at someone dr iving a car. It may cause an accident. • Do not fire the flash near a person’s ey es. It may impair the person’s vision. When  using flash to photograph an infant, keep at least 1 meter away. • Before storing the camera or accessory when not in use, remove the battery pack and  disconnect the power plug. This is to prevent electrical shock, heat generation, and fire. • Do not use the equipment where there is flammable gas. This is to prevent an  explosion or fire. COPY260• If you drop the equipment and the casing br eaks open to expose the internal parts, do  not touch the internal parts due to the possibility of electrical shock. • Do not disassemble or modify the equipment. High-voltage internal parts can cause  electrical shock. • Do not look at the sun or an extremely bright  light source through the camera or lens.  Doing so may damage your vision. • Keep the camera from the reach of small children. The neck strap can accidentally  choke the child. • Do not store the equipment in dusty or hum id places. This is to prevent fire and  electrical shock. • Before using the camera inside an airplane or hospital, check if it is allowed.  Electromagnetic waves emitted by the camera may interfere with the plane’s  instruments or the hospital’s medical equipment. • To prevent fire and electrical shock, follow the safeguards below: - Always insert the power plug all the way in. - Do not handle a power plug with wet hands. - When unplugging a power plug, grasp and pull the plug instead of the cord. - Do not scratch, cut, or excessively bend the cord or put a heavy object on the cord.  Also do not twist or tie the cords. - Do not connect too many power plugs to the same power outlet. - Do not use a cord whose insulation has been damaged. • Occasionally unplug the power plug and use a dry cloth to clean off the dust around  the power outlet. If the surrounding is dusty, humid, or oily, the dust on the power outlet  may become moist and short-circuit the outlet to cause a fire. Preventing Injury or Equipment Damage • Do not leave equipment inside a car under  the hot sun or near a heat source. The  equipment may become hot and cause skin burns. • Do not carry the camera around while it is attached to a tripod. Doing so may cause  injury. Also make sure the tripod is stur dy enough to support the camera and lens. • Do not leave a lens or lens-attached camera under the sun without the lens cap  attached. Otherwise, the lens may concentrate the sun’s rays and cause a fire. • Do not cover or wrap the battery-recharging apparatus with a cloth. Doing so may trap  heat within and cause the casing to deform or catch fire. • If you drop the camera in water or if wate r or metal fragments enter inside the camera,  promptly remove the battery pack and back- up battery. This is to prevent fire and  electrical shock. • Do not use or leave the battery pack or back-up battery in a hot environment. Doing so  may cause battery leakage or a shorter battery life. The battery pack or back-up  battery can also become hot and cause skin burns. • Do not use paint thinner, benzene, or ot her organic solvents to clean the equipment.  Doing so may cause fire or a health hazard. If the product does not work properly or requires repair, contact  your dealer or your nearest Canon Service Center.

Avoid exposing your camera to very cold or very hot temperatures.  Low or high temperature conditions may temporarily shorten the  battery life or cause the camera to temporarily stop working properly.  Avoid dramatic changes in temperature or humidity when using the  camera, as condensation may form on or within the camera. The integrated camera housing protects the camera and battery from  water damage. For more information, see Camera Housing  (page  39). Do not turn on your camera if the camera (inside the housing)  gets wet. If yo ur camera is already on, turn it off immediately. Allow  the camera to dry thoroughly before using it again. Do not dry the camera or battery with an external heat source such as a microwave  oven or hair dryer. Damage to the camera or battery caused by contact  with li quid (inside the housing) is not covered under the warranty. WARNING: Do not drop, disassemble, open, crush, bend, deform,  puncture, shred, microwave, incinerate, or paint the camera.  Do not insert foreign objects into any opening on the camera, such as the mini-USB port. Do not use the camera if it has been damaged—for example, if cracked, punctured, or harmed by water. Disassembling or puncturing the integrated battery can  cause an explosion or fire./ Important Messages MICROSD CARD MESSAGES NO SDNo card present.

Press any button to repair the file. TEMPERATURE ICON The Temperature icon appears on the camera status  screen when the camera becomes too hot and needs  to cool down. Simply let it sit and cool before attempting  to use it ag ain. Your camera was designed to identify  conditions of overheating and is designed to respond accordingly./ Camera Housing Your HERO camera comes with two types of backdoors : Standard  Backdoor (waterproof) and Skeleton Backdoor (non-waterproof). The Standard Backdoor makes the housing waterproof to 131’ (40m). Use this door when you  need to protect the camera from water, dirt, sand,  and other environmental hazards. The Skeleton Backdoor (non-waterproof) provides better sound quality by allowing more  sound to reach the camera’s microphone. It also  reduces wind noise at speeds up to 100mph when  mounted on helmets, motorcycles, bikes, and  other fast-moving vehicles. Use this backdoor  only when sand, excessive dirt/dust, and water  damage are not a risk. This backdoor is also recommended for use inside vehicles. PRO TIP:  Apply Rain-X ® or a similar anti-beading solution to the  camera housing lens to prevent water spots from forming when using  your camera in rain or water.40 41/ Camera Housing SWAPPING BACKDOORS   You can switch the backdoor of your HERO camera to suit your activity  and shooting conditions. Note: Your HERO cannot be removed from the housing. To Change the Backdoor: 1. Open the backdoor of the housing so that it hangs downwards. 2. Firmly pull the backdoor downwards until it snaps free from the  main housing. 3. Line up the replacement backdoor into the hinge opening. 4. Push upwards on the backdoor until it clicks into place.Slim housing surfboard mount installation Slim housing remove camera Slim housing insert cameraSlim housing closed Swapping housing doorsQuick Release Buckle + Thumb Screw + Slim housing = Complete Unit / Camera Housing PREVENTING WATER DAMAGE TO YOUR CAMERA   The rubber seal that lines the Standard Backdoor forms a waterproof  barrier that protects your HERO in wet conditions. Keep the Standard Backdoor’s rubber seal clean. A single hair or grain  of sand can cause a leak and damage your camera. After every use in salt water, close the Standard Backdoor tightly, and  then rinse the outside of the camera housing with non-salt water and  dry. Not doing this can eventually cause corrosion of the hinge pin and salt buildup in the seal, which can cause failure. To clean the seal, remove it from the backdoor, rinse it in fresh water,  and shake dry (drying with a cloth may cause lint to compromise the  seal). Re-install the seal into the grooves in the Standard Backdoor. WARNING: Failure to follow these steps each time you use   your GoPro can result in leaks that may damage or destroy your  camera. Water will damage both the camera and the battery, which could cause an explosion or fire. Your warranty does not cover water damage resulting from user error.42 43/ Using the Mounts ATTACHING YOUR CAMERA TO MOUNTS   To attach your HERO camera to a mount, you need a Quick Release  Buckle, thumb screw or hardware depending on the mount you are  using. For more information on mounts, visit gopro.com/support . Quick Release  BuckleThumb Screw Housing Complete Unit USING CURVED + FLAT ADHESIVE MOUNTS   The Curved + Flat Adhesive Mounts make it easy to attach the camera to curved and flat surfaces of helmets, vehicles, and gear. Using the  Quick Release Buckle, the assembled camera housing can be clicked  on and off the secured Curved or Flat Adhesive Mounts.      Flat Adhesive Mount Curved Adhesive MountSlim housing surfboard mount installation Slim housing remove camera Slim housing insert cameraSlim housing closed Swapping housing doorsQuick Release Buckle + Thumb Screw + Slim housing = Complete Unit/ Using the Mounts MOUNTING GUIDELINES   Follow these guidelines when attaching mounts: • Attach the adhesive mounts at least 24 hours before use. Allow   72 hours for complete adhesion. • Adhesive mounts must be mounted only on smooth surfaces. Porous or textured surfaces do not enable a proper bond. When  applying the mount, firmly press it into place and ensure full  contact over the entire surface. • Apply adhesive mounts to clean surfaces only. Wax, oil, dirt, or other debris reduce adhesion, which can result in a weak bond   and risk of losing the camera should the connection fail. • Attach adhesive mounts in room temperature conditions. Adhesives do not bond properly if applied in cold or damp  environments to cold or damp surfaces. For more information on mounts, visit gopro.com/support . WARNING: If using your camera with a GoPro helmet mount or  strap, always select a helmet that meets the applicable safety standard. Choose the right helmet for your particular sport or activity and make sure that it is the right fit and size for you. Inspect your helmet to ensure that it is in good condition, and follow the helmet manufacturer's instructions on safe helmet  use. Any helmet that has sustained a major impact should be  replaced. No helmet can protect against injury in every accident.44 45/ Using the Mounts ATTACHING THE LOCKING PLUG If you are using the HERO in high-impact sports such as surfing or  skiing where significant impact might occur, use the locking plug to  securely lock the Quick Release Buckle fingers into place. The locking  plug helps to prevent the housing from accidentally releasing from  the mount.  To Attach the Locking Plug: 1. Loop the circular ring over the thumbscrew. The circular ring acts as a leash to prevent dropping or losing the locking plug. 2. Slide the Quick Release Buckle into the mount until it clicks   into place. 3. Press the U-shaped part of the plug into the U-shaped space in   the Quick Release Buckle. WARNING: To avoid injury in the event of an accident, do not use  the locking plug or tether when using a mounting device on a helmet or other personal protective gear./ Frequently Asked Questions MY GOPRO WON’T POWER ON   Make sure your GoPro is charged. To charge your camera, use the  included USB cable and a computer or USB charging adapter. MY GOPRO WON’T RESPOND WHEN I PRESS A BUTTON   Press and hold the Power/Mode  button  for 8 seconds to reset your  camera. This  reset saves all of your content and settings, and powers  off your camera.MY PLAYBACK IS CHOPPY   Choppy playback is typically not a problem with the file. If your footage  skips, one of these situations is likely the cause: • Using an incompatible video player. Not all video players support the H.264 codec. For best results, use the latest GoPro software,  available for free at gopro.com/getstarted . • The computer does not meet the minimum requirements for HD  playback. The higher the resolution and frame rate of your video,  the harder the computer has to work to play it back.
