0," Group has signed contracts to buy 1.6 million tons a year of copper concentrate for the Mundra facility that is set to start operations next month. 

According to a report in Bloomberg, the facility’s – world’s largest single-location smelter for industrial metal – first 500,000 tons of capacity will be started next month, confirmed Adani Natural Resources CEO Vinay Prakash. That will eventually be expanded to 1 million tons by March 2029 in order to meet the projected demands for Indian copper by the end of the decade. 

As per the report, the conglomerate is now seeking resource security in critical minerals and resuming capital expenditure. Prakash told the news site that the Mundra plant will be a low-cost producer with higher metal recovery that will enable them to remain competitive in the market. The concentrate deals are a mix of short and long-term arrangements, he said. 

The $1.2 billion Mundra facility located in Gujarat is expected to reduce India's reliance on imports and support energy transition. The plant is projected to achieve a full-scale capacity of 1 million tonnes by FY29. 

Kutch Copper Ltd, an Adani Enterprises Ltd subsidiary, is establishing a greenfield copper refinery project for the production of refined copper. The first phase achieved financial closure in June 2022 through a syndicated club loan. 

Adani Group aspires to be a global leader in the copper business and the world’s largest copper smelting complex by 2030. India's per capita copper consumption, currently at 0.6 kg, is expected to double by 2030 due to the drive towards clean energy systems and the increasing penetration of electric vehicles. ",7

6,"A little under one year. That’s the time it took for the Adani-Hindenburg matter to reach its conclusion in the Supreme Court—from January 24, 2023, the day the US-based short-seller Hindenburg Research released a report accusing the Indian conglomerate of stock manipulation and financial fraud.

On January 3, 2024, a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court, headed by Chief Justice of India D.Y. Chandrachud, dismissed requests for creating a special investigation team (SIT) or transferring the probe into the allegations levelled by Hindenburg against the Adani Group to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). It reposed faith in capital markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi).


But this issue is far from over. Sebi is still conducting a probe related to certain allegations made by the US-based entity.

Without a doubt, the past year has been the most tumultuous in the history of the Adani Group, whose business interests span sectors like infrastructure, green energy, cement and FMCG.

The impact of the Hindenburg report was such that the conglomerate’s listed entities shed around $150 billion (`12.41 lakh crore) in market capitalisation just a month following its release.

To be sure, the group has consistently denied all allegations, terming the report a “malicious combination of selective misinformation and stale, baseless and discredited allegations that have been tested and rejected by India’s highest courts”. But that did little to assuage investor concerns, as was evident from the beating the stocks received.


After the verdict, Adani Group Chairman Gautam Adani posted on X (formerly Twitter): “The…Supreme Court’s judgement shows that: Truth has prevailed… I am grateful to those who stood by us. Our humble contribution to India’s growth story will continue…”

The Supreme Court order marks an important milestone as it brings the curtains down on what was one of the most keenly-followed cases by investors—not surprising as Adani Group stocks were among the biggest wealth creators in 2022.


“In an age where every news piece is taken at face value, the recent impartial scrutiny by regulators and the judiciary regarding third-party allegations is reassuring,” says Makarand Joshi, Founder of MMJC & Associates, a corporate compliance firm.


“The Supreme Court decision allowing Sebi to continue with investigation on the allegations…marks a significant step toward factual discernment. [It] sets a precedent, guiding retail investors to make informed decisions… It’s a powerful message against those exploiting rumours, signalling a new era of cautious investment decisions,” he adds.

The focus is now on Sebi. Incidentally, the regulator’s image was already boosted by the Supreme Court-appointed Expert Committee’s view that there was no failure on Sebi’s part.

The watchdog, as part of its submissions to the apex court, has stated that it conducted 24 investigations in the matter and 22 of those—alleged violations of rules on related-party transactions, insider trading, stock price manipulation, and FPI investments, among others—have already concluded. The Supreme Court has given Sebi three months to conclude the two pending probes.

Market participants, meanwhile, feel the biggest overhang on the group has lifted and the recent movement in stock prices corroborates this.

“Whatever was expected from the Supreme Court has come. Other than giving a good conduct certificate nothing else is pending,” says Arun Kejriwal, a market veteran and Founder of Kejriwal Research & Investment Services.

Some of the Adani Group stocks, including Adani Enterprises, Adani Green Energy, Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone, Adani Power, and Adani Total Gas have more than doubled when compared to their lows touched last year post the Hindenburg report.


But many group companies—Adani Total Gas, Adani Wilmar, Adani Energy Solutions, Adani Enterprises, and Adani Green Energy—are yet to touch the highs or levels seen before the Hindenburg report was released.

Stocks aside, investors will keep a close watch on Sebi as it concludes the two pending investigations and gets final clarity on a matter that has been in the news for the past one year and has impacted the overall Indian stock market as well.

The ball is now in Sebi’s court.",7

It’s also up to Virat Kohli whether he chooses to explain or not because, truth to tell, he really doesn’t owe any explanation to anyone.
Even in his absence, Virat Kohli commands attention.
It’s been more than two and a half weeks since the Board of Control for Cricket in India sent out a detailed press release (a rarity) informing all concerned that the former captain had withdrawn from the first two Tests against England owing to personal reasons. Speculation had been rife in various quarters regarding what those ‘personal reasons’ might be, until AB de Villiers seemingly scotched all whispers by announcing on social media that the Kohli family was expecting their second child.

Discover the thrill of cricket like never before, exclusively on HT. Explore now!
De Villiers, one of Kohli’s closest mates on the cricketing circuit, then retracted his ‘terrible mistake’ by ‘sharing false information, which was not true at all’. The game of speculation will, therefore, begin anew, which does no one any credit.

As compelling a figure as Kohli is, he is as entitled to his privacy as us more anonymous mortals. Just because he is a public personality who is a champion at India’s most followed sport doesn’t give anyone the right to dissect his personal life. It’s immaterial what the reasons behind Kohli’s unavailability are; it’s also up to him whether he chooses to explain or not because, truth to tell, he really doesn’t owe any explanation to the larger world, perhaps not even to those in a decision-making capacity who only need to know if he available for selection or not.

Kohli is a fiercely dedicated family man who goes to great lengths to ensure he doesn’t miss the crucial moments in his life. While he is driven when it comes to cricket, he isn’t consumed by it. He leaves nothing behind when he practices or plays, no matter which team he represents, because that’s how he is wired. His intensity is fierce, his competitiveness doesn’t need to be regurgitated because everyone knows how energised he is by the scent of a battle. There are few individuals who have been so passionately committed to the cause for as long as Kohli – he made his senior India debut in August 2008, by which time he had already made people sit up and take notice of his batting exploits and his in-your-face attitude at the Under-19 level whilst leading the team to the World Cup title in Kuala Lumpur the same year – and while everyone wants a slice of him, he is in the impossible position of not being able to oblige everyone.",7

The impact of the Hindenburg report was such that the conglomerate’s listed entities shed around $150 billion (`12.41 lakh crore) in market capitalisation just a month following its release.

To be sure, the group has consistently denied all allegations, terming the report a “malicious combination of selective misinformation and stale, baseless and discredited allegations that have been tested and rejected by India’s highest courts”. But that did little to assuage investor concerns, as was evident from the beating the stocks received.


After the verdict, Adani Group Chairman Gautam Adani posted on X (formerly Twitter): “The…Supreme Court’s judgement shows that: Truth has prevailed… I am grateful to those who stood by us. Our humble contribution to India’s growth story will continue…”

The Supreme Court order marks an important milestone as it brings the curtains down on what was one of the most keenly-followed cases by investors—not surprising as Adani Group stocks were among the biggest wealth creators in 2022.


“In an age where every news piece is taken at face value, the recent impartial scrutiny by regulators and the judiciary regarding third-party allegations is reassuring,” says Makarand Joshi, Founder of MMJC & Associates, a corporate compliance firm.


“The Supreme Court decision allowing Sebi to continue with investigation on the allegations…marks a significant step toward factual discernment. [It] sets a precedent, guiding retail investors to make informed decisions… It’s a powerful message against those exploiting rumours, signalling a new era of cautious investment decisions,” he adds.

The focus is now on Sebi. Incidentally, the regulator’s image was already boosted by the Supreme Court-appointed Expert Committee’s view that there was no failure on Sebi’s part.

The watchdog, as part of its submissions to the apex court, has stated that it conducted 24 investigations in the matter and 22 of those—alleged violations of rules on related-party transactions, insider trading, stock price manipulation, and FPI investments, among others—have already concluded. The Supreme Court has given Sebi three months to conclude the two pending probes.

Market participants, meanwhile, feel the biggest overhang on the group has lifted and the recent movement in stock prices corroborates this.

“Whatever was expected from the Supreme Court has come. Other than giving a good conduct certificate nothing else is pending,” says Arun Kejriwal, a market veteran and Founder of Kejriwal Research & Investment Services.

Some of the Adani Group stocks, including Adani Enterprises, Adani Green Energy, Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone, Adani Power, and Adani Total Gas have more than doubled when compared to their lows touched last year post the Hindenburg report.


But many group companies—Adani Total Gas, Adani Wilmar, Adani Energy Solutions, Adani Enterprises, and Adani Green Energy—are yet to touch the highs or levels seen before the Hindenburg report was released.

Stocks aside, investors will keep a close watch on Sebi as it concludes the two pending investigations and gets final clarity on a matter that has been in the news for the past one year and has impacted the overall Indian stock market as well.

The ball is now in Sebi’s court.",7

He also alleged that then prime minister Manmohan Singh was never given a free hand to run the government and was at times not aware of decisions being taken by the government.

During the course of his speech, Dubey also referred to a kin of a top Congress leader alleging he was involved in corruption.

This evoked a strong reaction from the opposition benches.

He also alleged involvement of various Congress leaders in the Adarsh society scam, claiming provisions of the coastal regulation zone were ignored.

Referring to the issue of corruption during his speech, he said while a committee had submitted its report during the UPA rule, its recommendation was implemented by the Modi government in its first cabinet meeting in May, 2004 by setting up a task force on black money.

He also alleged that an ""illicit money"" corridor from Bangladesh to Jharkhand was functioning to help a particular political party whose single-point agenda is the Muslim vote bank.

PM Modi today announced Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour, for the former PM.
New Delhi: NV Subhash, the grandson of late prime minister PV Narasimha Rao, slammed the Gandhi family on Friday after the Centre announced Bharat Ratna for the iconic politician, saying they were instrumental in making him a scapegoat for the failures of the Congress party.

PV Narasimha Rao teamed up with Manmohan Singh in 1991 and brought economic reforms that marked the beginning of India's success story.

It’s also up to Virat Kohli whether he chooses to explain or not because, truth to tell, he really doesn’t owe any explanation to anyone.
Even in his absence, Virat Kohli commands attention.
It’s been more than two and a half weeks since the Board of Control for Cricket in India sent out a detailed press release (a rarity) informing all concerned that the former captain had withdrawn from the first two Tests against England owing to personal reasons. Speculation had been rife in various quarters regarding what those ‘personal reasons’ might be, until AB de Villiers seemingly scotched all whispers by announcing on social media that the Kohli family was expecting their second child.

Discover the thrill of cricket like never before, exclusively on HT. Explore now!
De Villiers, one of Kohli’s closest mates on the cricketing circuit, then retracted his ‘terrible mistake’ by ‘sharing false information, which was not true at all’. The game of speculation will, therefore, begin anew, which does no one any credit.

As compelling a figure as Kohli is, he is as entitled to his privacy as us more anonymous mortals. Just because he is a public personality who is a champion at India’s most followed sport doesn’t give anyone the right to dissect his personal life. It’s immaterial what the reasons behind Kohli’s unavailability are; it’s also up to him whether he chooses to explain or not because, truth to tell, he really doesn’t owe any explanation to the larger world, perhaps not even to those in a decision-making capacity who only need to know if he available for selection or not.

Kohli is a fiercely dedicated family man who goes to great lengths to ensure he doesn’t miss the crucial moments in his life. While he is driven when it comes to cricket, he isn’t consumed by it. He leaves nothing behind when he practices or plays, no matter which team he represents, because that’s how he is wired. His intensity is fierce, his competitiveness doesn’t need to be regurgitated because everyone knows how energised he is by the scent of a battle. There are few individuals who have been so passionately committed to the cause for as long as Kohli – he made his senior India debut in August 2008, by which time he had already made people sit up and take notice of his batting exploits and his in-your-face attitude at the Under-19 level whilst leading the team to the World Cup title in Kuala Lumpur the same year – and while everyone wants a slice of him, he is in the impossible position of not being able to oblige everyone.",7
