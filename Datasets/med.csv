NAFLD is the most  common cause of abnormal liver function tests in primary care. It is associated with obesity, insulin  resistance, Diabetes, Dyslipidemia, hypertension and is considered as hepatic manifestation of the Metabolic  syndrome. The pivotal issue in managing patients with NAFLD is the diagnosis of steatohepatitis & fibrosis at  early stage. Liver biopsy (the Gold standard for diagnosing & assessing fibrosis) is not considered appropriate  as first line tool for diagnosing fibrosis in unselected NAFLD patients. This test has high negative predictive  value, thus can be used as first line test to rule out patients without advanced fibrosis thereby preventing  unnecessary secondary care referrals.

Polyreactive RF has  binding specificity for substances other than IgG like nuclear components. This polyreactive RF is usually of  the IgM class with low affinity. RF is not specific only for Rheumatoid arthritis, but it is often seen in cases of  chronic infection and other systemic inflammatory conditions.

Ele~ated le~els  of BUN and creatinine in the klood can indicate decreased vidney function. The glomerular bltration rate (GFR) is a measure  of how well your vidneys are bltering waste products from your klood. A low GFR can indicate decreased vidney function. The  urine alkumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) is a measure of the amount of alkumin (a type of protein) in your urine relati~e to the  amount of creatinine. Ele~ated le~els of ACR can indicate damage to the vidneys.  <<End of report<< Dr. Dummy MD Pathology 1 / 1

After 5 weeks of gestation, the doubling time gradually increases to 2-3 days. Serial  determination of HCG is helpful when abnormal pregnancy is suspected. In ectopic pregnancy and  spontaneous abortion HCG concentration increases slowly or decreases. Ultrasonography should detect a  gestational sac in the uterus of all patients having HCG concentration > 6500 mIU/mL. Failure to detect a  gestational sac 24 days or more after conception is presumptive evidence of ectopic pregnancy. The  presence of twins approximately doubles the HCG concentration.

Majority of CAH cases (90%) are due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency leading to  elevations of 17-hydroxyprogesterone levels. Less commonly it is due to 11-hydroxylase deficiency. 17-OHP  levels are normally high at birth and decrease rapidly during the first few postnatal days. In contrast, 17-OHP  levels increase with time in infants affected with CAH The classic  variety presents in the newborns or early childhood with adrenal insufficiency and virilization with or  without salt wasting.  The non-classic form  presents in late childhood or young adulthood as hirsutism, amenorrhea and infertility in  females and precocious puberty in males.

Patients with profound deficiency usually present around 3 months of age but may present as early as  first week of life and as late as 10 years of age.  Untreated children show alopecia, periorificial skin rash,  irreversible sensorineural deafness, conjunctivitis, development delays and hypotonia. Partial deficiency may  be asymptomatic or produce milder symptoms. Certain organic acidurias may present similarly as biotinidase  deficiency. Patients are successfully treated with oral doses of biotin, a water soluble form of vitamin B. PatientReportSCSuperPanel.SP_GENERAL_TEMPLATE01_SC (Version: 7) *149532270* . Page 2 of 11"

It is a multisystem disorder affecting pulmonary, gastrointestinal and reproductive organs. The phenotypic  expression of the disease is heterogenous ranging from  meconium ileus to severe respiratory disease in  infants. Immunoreactive trypsinogen ( IRT) is used to screen newborns for increased risk of Cystic fibrosis.  Screening for Cystic Fibrosis has helped in increasing survival age largely due to organ transplantation,  improved nutrition, new drug therapies and shall continue to do so with a potential of successful gene therapy. Increased IRT Levels Cystic fibrosis - Delta F 508 heterozygotes ( Commonest mutation ), Hypoxic insult to pancreas, Renal  insufficiency, Congenital heart disease, Spina bifida, Gastroschisis, Viral infections, Trisomy 13,18 &  Galactosemia.

Deficiency of this enzyme results in Phenylketonuria ( PKU) which is inherited as an autosomal recessive  trait with Classic PKU being the commonest. Phenylalanine levels are normal in the cord blood of neonates  and only rise after milk feedings have been initiated, hence screens obtained prior to 48 hours may give false  negative results. The urine of affected individuals has a peculiar musty odour. Brain myelination is abnormal.  PKU should be considered in an infant who loses developmental milestones in the first 6 to 12 months of life.  Untreated PKU leads to severe brain damage with intellectual impairment, behavior abnormalities, seizures &  spasticity.

The TSH surge starts 30 min after  birth (T4 some hours later), is most marked for the next 24 hours, but may persist for 48 to 72 hours. Thus,  cord blood is largely spared of the neonatal surge.

Most neonates develop mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia between days 2 and 5 after birth. Peak  levels are typically 5-10 mg/ dL and decline to normal level within 2 weeks . It is recommended to interpret  bilirubin levels according to infant ’s age in hours.  Physiological jaundice generally is not harmful but bilirubin  concentration above 10 mg/ dL coupled with prematurity, low serum albumin, acidosis, and substances that  complete with binding site albumin (eg. ceftriaxone, sulfisoxarole, aspirin ), may increase the risk for  Kernicterus.

Detection of HBsAg may be  observed in Hepatitis B viral infection for transient period of time after HBV vaccination. 3.The Hepatitis B Surface Antigen Rapid Test cannot detect less than 1 ng/mL of HBsAg in specimens .  Sensitivity and Specificity of this HBsAg test by Immunochromatography is 99.8%  and 99.2%  respectively. 4.False negative reaction may be due to processing of sample collected early in the course of disease  or presence of mutant forms of HBsAg.   5.For monitoring HBsAg levels, Quantitative HBsAg assay is recommended. 6.Test conducted on serum. Comment Hepatitis B Virus (HBV ) is a member of the Hepadna virus family causing infections of the liver with variable  clinical features. Hepatitis B is transmitted by blood and body fluids, sexually and from mother to fetus.  In  most cases HBV hepatitis is self limiting, but 1-2% adolescents and adults develop Chronic Hepatitis .   Frequency of chronic HBV infection is 5-10% in immunocompromised patients and 80% in neonates.  HBsAg is the first serological marker after infection with HBV appearing 1-10 weeks after exposure and 2-8  weeks before the onset of clinical symptoms. HBsAg persists during the acute phase and disappears 12-20  weeks after onset of symptoms late in the convalescence period. Persistence of HBsAg for more than six  months indicates development of carrier state or Chronic liver disease. PatientReportSCSuperPanel.SP_GENERAL_TEMPLATE01_SC (Version: 7) *269282572* .

Confirmation of screen positives is recommended by Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS). ·The interpretive unit is MoM (Multiples of Median) which takes into account variables such as gestational age  (ultrasound) , maternal weight, race, insulin dependent Diabetes, multiple gestation, IVF (Date of Birth of Donor, if  applicable ), smoking & previous history of Down syndrome. Accurate availability of this data for Risk Calculation  is critical. ·Ideally all pregnant women should be screened for Prenatal disorders irrespective of maternal age.

Ref. Interval translucency, Nasal bone visualization and biochemical tests (Combined test) increases the detection rate of Down  syndrome to 85% at the same false positive rate. Comments First trimester screening for Prenatal disorders (Trisomy 21, 18 & 13) is essential to identify those women at sufficient risk for  a congenital anomaly in the fetus to warrant further evaluation and followup. For Open neural tube defects, second trimester  screening before 20 weeks is recommended. These are screening procedures which cannot discriminate all affected  pregnancies from all unaffected pregnancies. Screening cutoffs are established by using MoM values that maximize the  detection rate and minimize false positives.

After the result of the Trisomy 21 test (with NT) it is expected that among 1280 women with the same data,  there is one woman with a trisomy 21 pregnancy and 1279 women with not affected pregnancies. The calculated risk by PRISCA depends on the accuracy of the information provided by the referring  physician.

NAFLD is the most  common cause of abnormal liver function tests in primary care. It is associated with obesity, insulin  resistance, Diabetes, Dyslipidemia, hypertension and is considered as hepatic manifestation of the Metabolic  syndrome. The pivotal issue in managing patients with NAFLD is the diagnosis of steatohepatitis & fibrosis at  early stage. Liver biopsy (the Gold standard for diagnosing & assessing fibrosis) is not considered appropriate  as first line tool for diagnosing fibrosis in unselected NAFLD patients. This test has high negative predictive  value, thus can be used as first line test to rule out patients without advanced fibrosis thereby preventing  unnecessary secondary care referrals.

Polyreactive RF has  binding specificity for substances other than IgG like nuclear components. This polyreactive RF is usually of  the IgM class with low affinity. RF is not specific only for Rheumatoid arthritis, but it is often seen in cases of  chronic infection and other systemic inflammatory conditions. Healthy individuals > 65 years of age may also  show positive RF results. In addition to the common IgM RF, both IgA RF & IgG RF have been detected. IgA  RF has been related to the more severe form of the disease with erosions. PatientReportSCSuperPanel.SP_GENERAL_TEMPLATE01_SC (Version: 7) *145296998* . Page 2 of 7"

Ele~ated le~els  of BUN and creatinine in the klood can indicate decreased vidney function. The glomerular bltration rate (GFR) is a measure  of how well your vidneys are bltering waste products from your klood. A low GFR can indicate decreased vidney function. The  urine alkumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) is a measure of the amount of alkumin (a type of protein) in your urine relati~e to the  amount of creatinine. Ele~ated le~els of ACR can indicate damage to the vidneys.  <<End of report<< Dr. Dummy MD Pathology 1 / 1

Detectable amounts of  beta HCG are present 8-11 days after conception. During the second to fifth week, HCG levels double in  about 1.5 days. After 5 weeks of gestation, the doubling time gradually increases to 2-3 days. Serial  determination of HCG is helpful when abnormal pregnancy is suspected. In ectopic pregnancy and  spontaneous abortion HCG concentration increases slowly or decreases. Ultrasonography should detect a  gestational sac in the uterus of all patients having HCG concentration > 6500 mIU/mL. Failure to detect a  gestational sac 24 days or more after conception is presumptive evidence of ectopic pregnancy. The  presence of twins approximately doubles the HCG concentration.

Majority of CAH cases (90%) are due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency leading to  elevations of 17-hydroxyprogesterone levels. Less commonly it is due to 11-hydroxylase deficiency. 17-OHP  levels are normally high at birth and decrease rapidly during the first few postnatal days. In contrast, 17-OHP  levels increase with time in infants affected with CAH The classic  variety presents in the newborns or early childhood with adrenal insufficiency and virilization with or  without salt wasting.  The non-classic form  presents in late childhood or young adulthood as hirsutism, amenorrhea and infertility in  females and precocious puberty in males.

Patients with profound deficiency usually present around 3 months of age but may present as early as  first week of life and as late as 10 years of age.  Untreated children show alopecia, periorificial skin rash,  irreversible sensorineural deafness, conjunctivitis, development delays and hypotonia. Partial deficiency may  be asymptomatic or produce milder symptoms. Certain organic acidurias may present similarly as biotinidase  deficiency. Patients are successfully treated with oral doses of biotin, a water soluble form of vitamin B. PatientReportSCSuperPanel.SP_GENERAL_TEMPLATE01_SC (Version: 7) *149532270* . Page 2 of 11"

It is a multisystem disorder affecting pulmonary, gastrointestinal and reproductive organs. The phenotypic  expression of the disease is heterogenous ranging from  meconium ileus to severe respiratory disease in  infants. Immunoreactive trypsinogen ( IRT) is used to screen newborns for increased risk of Cystic fibrosis.  Screening for Cystic Fibrosis has helped in increasing survival age largely due to organ transplantation,  improved nutrition, new drug therapies and shall continue to do so with a potential of successful gene therapy.

Deficiency of this enzyme results in Phenylketonuria ( PKU) which is inherited as an autosomal recessive  trait with Classic PKU being the commonest. Phenylalanine levels are normal in the cord blood of neonates  and only rise after milk feedings have been initiated, hence screens obtained prior to 48 hours may give false  negative results. The urine of affected individuals has a peculiar musty odour. Brain myelination is abnormal.  PKU should be considered in an infant who loses developmental milestones in the first 6 to 12 months of life.  Untreated PKU leads to severe brain damage with intellectual impairment, behavior abnormalities, seizures &  spasticity.

The crucial point  to remember when screening for CH is the neonatal surge of TSH and T4. The TSH surge starts 30 min after  birth (T4 some hours later), is most marked for the next 24 hours, but may persist for 48 to 72 hours. Thus,  cord blood is largely spared of the neonatal surge.

Most neonates develop mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia between days 2 and 5 after birth. Peak  levels are typically 5-10 mg/ dL and decline to normal level within 2 weeks . It is recommended to interpret  bilirubin levels according to infant ’s age in hours.  Physiological jaundice generally is not harmful but bilirubin  concentration above 10 mg/ dL coupled with prematurity, low serum albumin, acidosis, and substances that  complete with binding site albumin (eg. ceftriaxone, sulfisoxarole, aspirin ), may increase the risk for  Kernicterus.

Note 1.This is a screening test and the result should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical findings and  other diagnostic tests. 2.This assay is used for qualitative detection of Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg ) in serum samples  and cannot differentiate between the stages of Hepatitis B viral infection. Detection of HBsAg may be  observed in Hepatitis B viral infection for transient period of time after HBV vaccination. 3.The Hepatitis B Surface Antigen Rapid Test cannot detect less than 1 ng/mL of HBsAg in specimens .  Sensitivity and Specificity of this HBsAg test by Immunochromatography is 99.8%  and 99.2%  respectively. 4.False negative reaction may be due to processing of sample collected early in the course of disease  or presence of mutant forms of HBsAg.   5.For monitoring HBsAg levels, Quantitative HBsAg assay is recommended. 6.Test conducted on serum. Comment Hepatitis B Virus (HBV ) is a member of the Hepadna virus family causing infections of the liver with variable  clinical features. Hepatitis B is transmitted by blood and body fluids, sexually and from mother to fetus.  In  most cases HBV hepatitis is self limiting, but 1-2% adolescents and adults develop Chronic Hepatitis .   Frequency of chronic HBV infection is 5-10% in immunocompromised patients and 80% in neonates.  HBsAg is the first serological marker after infection with HBV appearing 1-10 weeks after exposure and 2-8  weeks before the onset of clinical symptoms. HBsAg persists during the acute phase and disappears 12-20  weeks after onset of symptoms late in the convalescence period. Persistence of HBsAg for more than six  months indicates development of carrier state or Chronic liver disease. PatientReportSCSuperPanel.SP_GENERAL_TEMPLATE01_SC (Version: 7) *269282572* .

Confirmation of screen positives is recommended by Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS). ·The interpretive unit is MoM (Multiples of Median) which takes into account variables such as gestational age  (ultrasound) , maternal weight, race, insulin dependent Diabetes, multiple gestation, IVF (Date of Birth of Donor, if  applicable ), smoking & previous history of Down syndrome. Accurate availability of this data for Risk Calculation  is critical. ·Ideally all pregnant women should be screened for Prenatal disorders irrespective of maternal age. The test is valid  between 9-13.6 weeks of gestation, but ideal sampling time is between 10-13 weeks gestation.  ·First trimester detection rate of Down syndrome is 60% with a false positive rate of 5%.

Ref. Interval translucency, Nasal bone visualization and biochemical tests (Combined test) increases the detection rate of Down  syndrome to 85% at the same false positive rate. Comments First trimester screening for Prenatal disorders (Trisomy 21, 18 & 13) is essential to identify those women at sufficient risk for  a congenital anomaly in the fetus to warrant further evaluation and followup. For Open neural tube defects, second trimester  screening before 20 weeks is recommended. These are screening procedures which cannot discriminate all affected  pregnancies from all unaffected pregnancies. Screening cutoffs are established by using MoM values that maximize the  detection rate and minimize false positives.

After the result of the Trisomy 21 test (with NT) it is expected that among 1280 women with the same data,  there is one woman with a trisomy 21 pregnancy and 1279 women with not affected pregnancies. The calculated risk by PRISCA depends on the accuracy of the information provided by the referring  physician.
