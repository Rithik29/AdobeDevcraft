0,0,0,"Nutrition in Plants  1 In  Class  VI  you  learnt  that  food  is  essential  for  all  living  organisms. You also learnt that carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins and minerals are components of food. These components of  food  are  called  nutrients  and  are necessary for our body.  All  living  organisms  require  food. Plants  can  synthesise  food  for themselves    but  animals  including humans cannot. They get it from plants or  animals  that  eat  plants.  Thus, humans  and  animals  are  directly  or indirectly dependent on plants.  Boojho wants to know how plants prepare their own food.  1.1  MODE  OF  NUTRITION  IN  PLANTS Plants are the only organisms that can prepare  food  for  themselves  by  using water, carbon dioxide and minerals. The raw  materials  are  present  in  their surroundings.  The  nutrients  enable   living organisms to build their bodies, to grow, to repair damaged parts of their bodies and provide the energy to carry out life processes.  Nutrition  is  the  mode  of taking  food  by  an  organism  and  its  utilisation  by  the  body.  The  mode  of nutrition in which organisms make food themselves  from  simple  substances  is called autotrophic (auto = self; trophos =  nourishment)  nutrition.  Therefore, plants are called  autotrophs. Animals and most other organisms take in food prepared  by  plants.  They  are  called heterotrophs (heteros = other).  Paheli wants to know why our body cannot make food from carbon dioxide, water and minerals like plants do.  Now  we  may  ask  where  the  food factories of plants are located: whether food  is  made  in  all  parts  of  a  plant  or only  in  certain  parts?  How  do  plants obtain  the  raw  materials  from  the surroundings?  How  do  they  transport them to the food factories of plants?  1.2 PHOTOSYNTHESIS — FOOD  MAKING PROCESS IN PLANTS  Leaves are the food factories of plants. Therefore,  all  the  raw  materials  must reach  the  leaf.  Water  and  minerals present in the soil are absorbed by the roots  and  transported  to  the  leaves. Carbon  dioxide  from  air  is  taken  in  Rationalised 2023-24Cells  You have seen that buildings are made of bricks. Similarly,  the  bodies  of  living  organisms  are made of tiny units called cells. Cells can be seen only  under  the  microscope.  Some  organisms are made of only one cell. The cell is enclosed by a thin outer boundary, called the cell membrane. Most  cells  have  a  distinct,  centrally  located spherical structure called the nucleus (Fig. 1.1). The  nucleus  is  surrounded  by  a  jelly-like substance called cytoplasm.  Nucleus  Cytoplasm  Cell membrane  Fig. 1.1 Cell  through  the  tiny  pores  present  on  the surface  of  leaves.  These  pores  are surrounded by ‘guard cells’. Such pores are called stomata [Fig. 1.2 (c)].  Boojho wants to know how water and minerals absorbed by roots reach the leaves.  Water and minerals are transported to the leaves by the vessels which run like pipes throughout the root, the stem, the branches and the leaves. They form a  continuous  path  or  passage  for  the nutrients  to  reach  the  leaf.  They  are called vessels. You will learn more about transport  of  materials  in  plants  in Chapter 7.  Paheli wants to know what is so special about the leaves that they can synthesise food but  other parts of the plant cannot.  The  leaves  have  a  green  pigment called  chlorophyll.  It  helps  leaves  to capture the energy of the sunlight. This energy  is  used  to  synthesise  (prepare) food  from  carbon  dioxide  and  water. Since the synthesis of food occurs in the presence  of  sunlight,  it  is  called photosynthesis (Photo: light; synthesis : to combine). So we find that chlorophyll, sunlight, carbon dioxide and water are necessary  to  carry  out  the  process  of photosynthesis. It is a unique process on  the  earth.  The  solar  energy  is captured by the leaves and stored in the plant in the form of food. Thus, sun is the ultimate source of energy for all living organisms.  Can you imagine life on earth in the  absence of photosynthesis!  In  the  absence  of  photosynthesis there  would  not  be  any  food.  The survival  of  almost  all  living  organisms directly or indirectly depends upon the food  made  by  the  plants.  Besides, oxygen which is essential for the survival  2  SCIENCE  Rationalised 2023-24Besides  leaves,  photosynthesis  also  takes  place  in  other  green  parts  of  the plant — in green stems and green branches. The desert plants have scale- or spine-like  leaves  to  reduce  loss  of  water  by  transpiration.  These  plants  have green stems which carry out photosynthesis.  of  all  organisms  is  produced  during photosynthesis.  In  the  absence  of photosynthesis, life would be impossible on the earth.  During  photosynthesis,  chlorophyll containing  cells  of  leaves  (Fig.  1.2),  in the  presence  of  sunlight,  use  carbon dioxide  and  water  to  synthesise carbohydrates  (Fig.  1.3).  The  process can be represented in an equation:  Carbon dioxide water     sunlight  chlorophyll  Carbohydrate oxygen    Chlorophyll  Light energy  Carbon dioxide  Oxygen  Chlorophyll in leaf  Water and minerals  Fig. 1.3   Diagram showing photosynthesis  During  the  process  oxygen  is released.  The  presence  of  starch  in leaves  indicates  the  occurrence  of photosynthesis.  Starch  is  also  a carbohydrate.  Guard Cells  Stoma  (b) Section of a leaf  (a) Leaf  Guard cells  Boojho has observed some plants with deep red, violet or brown leaves. He wants to know whether these leaves also carry out photosynthesis.  Activity  1.1  (c) Stoma  Fig. 1.2  Stomatal opening  Take two potted plants of the same kind. Keep one in the dark (or in a black box) for 72 hours and the other in sunlight.  NUTRITION IN PLANTS  3  Rationalised 2023-24Perform  iodine  test  with  the  leaves  of both the plants as you did in Class VI. Record your results. Now leave the pot which was earlier kept in the dark, in the sunlight for 3 – 4 days and perform the  iodine  test  again  on  its  leaves. Record  your  observations  in  your notebook.  The leaves other than green also have chlorophyll.  The  large  amount  of  red, brown  and  other  pigments  mask  the green colour (Fig. 1.4). Photosynthesis takes place in these leaves also.  Fig. 1.4  Leaves of various colours  You  often  see  slimy,  green  patches in ponds or stagnant water bodies. These are  generally  formed  by  the  growth  of organisms called algae. Can you guess why  algae  are  green  in  colour?  They contain  chlorophyll  which  gives  them the green colour. Algae can also prepare their own food by photosynthesis.  Synthesis of plant food other than  carbohydrates You  have  just  learnt  that  plants synthesise  carbohydrates  through  the process  of  photosynthesis.  The  carbohydrates  are  made  of  carbon, hydrogen  and  oxygen.  These  are  used to synthesise other components of food such as proteins and fats. But proteins are  nitrogenous  substances  which contain  nitrogen.  From  where  do  the plants obtain nitrogen?  Recall  that  nitrogen  is  present  in abundance  in  gaseous  form  in  the  air. However, plants cannot absorb nitrogen in this form. Soil has certain bacteria that convert gaseous nitrogen into a usable form and release it into the soil. These are  absorbed  by  the  plants  along  with water. Also, you might have seen farmers adding fertilisers rich in nitrogen to the soil.  In  this  way  the  plants  fulfil  their requirements of nitrogen along with the other  constituents.  Plants  can  then synthesise proteins and vitamins.  1.3 OTHER MODES OF NUTRITION IN  PLANTS  There are some plants which do not have chlorophyll.  They  cannot  synthesise food.  How  do  they  survive  and  from where  do  they  derive  nutrition?  Like humans  and  animals  such  plants depend on the food produced by other plants.  They  use  the  heterotrophic mode of nutrition. Look at Fig. 1.5. Do you see a yellow wiry branched structure twining around the stem and branches of a tree? This is a plant called Cuscuta (Amarbel). It does not have chlorophyll. It takes readymade food from the plant on  which  it  is  climbing.  The  plant  on which it climbs is called the host. Since it deprives the host of valuable nutrients,  4  SCIENCE  Rationalised 2023-24hair  which  are  directed  downwards. When an insect lands in the pitcher, the lid  closes  and  the  trapped  insect  gets entangled into the hair. The lid closes and the insect is trapped. The insect is digested by the digestive juices secreted in  the  pitcher  and  its  nutrients  are absorbed. Such insect-eating plants are called insectivorous plants.  Is it possible that such plants do not get all the required nutrients from the soil in which they grow?  Boojho is confused. If the pitcher plant is green and carries out photosynthesis, then why does it feed on insects?  Lid  Leaf modified into pitcher  Fig. 1.6  Pitcher plant showing lid and pitcher  1.4 SAPROTROPHS  You  might  have  seen  packets  of mushrooms  sold  in  the  vegetable  Fig. 1.5  Cuscuta (Amarbel) on host plant  Cuscuta is called the parasite. Are we and  other  animals  also  a  kind  of parasites?  You  should  think  about  it and discuss with your teacher.  Paheli wants to know whether mosquitoes, bed bugs, lice and leeches that suck our blood are also parasites.  Have you seen or heard of plants that can eat animals? There are a few plants which can trap insects and digest them. Is it not amazing? Such plants may be green or of some other colour. Look at the plant in Fig. 1.6. The pitcher-like or jug-like  structure  is  the  modified  part of leaf. The apex of the leaf forms a lid which can open and close the mouth of the pitcher. Inside the pitcher there are  NUTRITION IN PLANTS  5  Rationalised 2023-24market. You may have also seen fluffy umbrella-like patches growing in moist soils or on rotting wood during the rainy season (Fig. 1.7). Let us find out what type  of  nutrients  they  need  to  survive and from where they get them.  Fig. 1.7  Packet of mushrooms, a mushroom growing on decayed material  Boojho wants to know how these organisms acquire nutrients. They do not have  mouths like animals do. They are not like green plants as they lack chlorophyll and cannot make food by photosynthesis.  Activity  1.2  Take a piece of bread and moisten it with water.  Leave  it  in  a  moist  warm  place for  2–3  days  or  until  fluffy  patches appear on them (Fig. 1.8). What is the colour  of  these  patches?  Observe  the patches  under  a  microscope  or  a magnifying  glass.  Write  down  your observations in the notebook. You will see  cotton-like  threads  spread  on  the piece of bread.  Fig. 1.8  Fungi growing on bread  These  organisms  are  called  fungi. They have a different mode of nutrition. They  absorb  the  nutrients  from  the bread. This mode of nutrition in which organisms take in nutrients from dead and  decaying  matter  is  called saprotrophic nutrition. Such organisms with saprotrophic mode of nutrition are called saprotrophs.  Fungi also grow on pickles, leather, clothes and other articles that are left in hot and humid weather for long time. During the rainy season they spoil many things.  Ask  your  parents  about  the menace of fungi in your house.  The  fungal  spores  are  generally present  in the air. When they land on  Paheli is keen to know whether her beautiful shoes, which she wore on special  occasions, were spoiled by fungi during the rainy season. She wants to know how fungi appear suddenly during the rainy season.  6  SCIENCE  Rationalised 2023-24Boojho says once his grandfather told him that his wheat fields were spoiled by a fungus. He wants to know if fungi cause diseases also.  Paheli told him that many fungi like yeast and mushrooms are  useful, but some fungi cause diseases in plants, animals including humans. Some fungi are also used as medicines.  wet and warm things they germinate and grow. Now, can you figure out how we can  protect  our  things  from  getting spoiled?  Some  organisms  live  together  and share both shelter and nutrients. This relationship  is  called  symbiosis.  For example,  certain  fungi  live  inside  the roots  of  plants.  The  plants  provide nutrients to the fungus and, in return, the fungus provides water and certain nutrients.  In  organisms  called  lichens,  a chlorophyll-containing partner, which is an alga, and a fungus live together. The fungus  provides  shelter,  water  and minerals to the alga and, in return, the alga prepares and provides food to the fungus.  1.5 HOW NUTRIENTS ARE  REPLENISHED IN THE SOIL  Have  you  seen  farmers  spreading manure  or  fertilisers  in  the  fields,  or gardeners  using  them  in  lawns  or  in pots? Do you know why this is done?  You  learnt  that  plants  absorb minerals and nutrients from the soil. So, their amounts in the soil keep on declining.  Fertilisers  and  manures contain  nutrients  such  as  nitrogen, potassium,  phosphorous,  etc.  These nutrients need to be added from time to time to enrich the soil. We can grow plants  and  keep  them  healthy  if we can fulfil the nutrient requirement of plants.  Usually  crop  plants  absorb  a  lot  of nitrogen and the soil becomes deficient in  nitrogen.  You  learnt  that  though nitrogen gas is available in plenty in the air, plants cannot use it in the manner they can use carbon dioxide. They need nitrogen  in  a  soluble  form.  The bacterium  called  Rhizobium  can  take atmospheric nitrogen and convert it into a  usable  form.  But  Rhizobium  cannot make  its  own  food.  So  it  often  lives  in the  roots  of  gram,  peas,  moong,  beans and  other  legumes  and  provides  them with  nitrogen.  In  return,  the  plants provide  food  and  shelter  to  the bacteria.  They,  thus,  have  a symbiotic relationship. This association is  of  great  significance  for  the farmers.  They  can  reduce  the  use  of nitrogenous fertiliser where leguminous  NUTRITION IN PLANTS  7  Rationalised 2023-24plants are grown. Most of the pulses (dals) are obtained from leguminous plants.  In  this  chapter  you  learnt  that most  of  the  plants  are  autotrophs. Only  a  few  plants  are  parasitic  or saprotrophic.  They  derive  nutrition  from other organisms. All animals  are categorised  as  heterotrophs  since they  depend  on  plants  and  other animals  for  food.  Can  we  say  that the  insectivorous  plants  are  partial heterotrophs?  Keywords  Autotrophic Chlorophyll Heterotrophs Host  Insectivorous Nutrient Nutrition Parasite  Photosynthesis Saprotrophs Saprotrophic Stomata  What you have learnt   All  organisms  need  food  and  utilise  it  to  get  energy  for  growth  and  maintenance of their body.   Green  plants  synthesise  food  for  themselves  by  the  process  of  photosynthesis. They are autotrophs.   Plants like Cuscuta are parasites. They take food from the host plant.  Plants use simple chemical substances like carbon dioxide, water and  minerals for the synthesis of food.   Chlorophyll,  water,  carbon  dioxide  and  sunlight  are  the  essential  requirements for photosynthesis.   Complex chemical substances such as carbohydrates are the products  of photosynthesis.   Solar energy is absorbed by the chlorophylls present in leaves/plants.   Oxygen is produced during photosynthesis.  Oxygen released in photosynthesis is utilised by living organisms for  their survival.   Many fungi derive nutrition from dead and decaying matter.

1,1,0,"Nutrition in Animals  2 You have learnt in Chapter 1 that  plants can prepare their own food by the process of photosynthesis but animals cannot. Animals get their food  from  plants,  either  directly  by eating  plants  or  indirectly  by  eating animals that eat plants. Some animals eat both plants and animals. Recall that all organisms including humans require food for growth, repair and functioning of the body. Animal nutrition includes nutrient requirement, mode of intake of food and its utilisation in the body.  You have studied in Class VI that food consists  of  many  components.  Try  to recall and list them below:  1. ______________________  2. ______________________  3. ______________________  4. ______________________  5. ______________________  6. ______________________  The  components  of  food  such  as carbohydrates are complex substances.

The breakdown  of  complex  components  of  Complex substance  Simpler substances  food  into  simpler  substances  is  called digestion.  2.1 DIFFERENT WAYS OF TAKING FOOD The mode of taking food into the body varies in different organisms. Bees and humming-birds  suck  the  nectar  of plants,  infants  of  human  and  many other  animals  feed  on  mother’s  milk. Snakes  like  the  python  swallow  the animals they prey upon. Some aquatic animals filter tiny food particles floating nearby and feed upon them.  Activity 2.1  What  is  the  type  of  food  and  mode  of feeding of the following animals?

After  opening  the  shell,  the  starfish pops  out  its  stomach  through  its mouth  to  eat  the  soft  animal  inside the shell. The stomach then goes back into the body and the food is slowly digested.  Fig. 2.1  Starfish  2.2 DIGESTION IN HUMANS We  take  in  food  through  the  mouth, digest and utilise it. The unused parts of the food are defecated. Have you ever wondered  what  happens  to  the  food inside  the  body?  The  food  passes through  a  continuous  canal  (Fig.  2.2) which begins at the buccal cavity and ends  at  the  anus.  The  canal  can  be divided  into  various  compartments: (1)  the  buccal  cavity,  (2)  foodpipe  or oesophagus,  (3)  stomach,  (4)  small intestine, (5) large intestine ending in the rectum and (6) the anus. Is it not a very  long  path?  These  parts  together form  the  alimentary  canal  (digestive tract). The food components gradually get digested as food travels through the various compartments. The inner walls  of  the  stomach  and  the  small  intestine, and the various glands associated with the canal such as salivary glands, the liver and the pancreas secrete digestive juices. The  digestive  juices  convert  complex  Oesophagus  Liver  Gall  bladder  Buccal cavity  Salivary gland  Stomach  Pancreas  Small intestine  Large intestine  Rectum Anus  Fig. 2.2  Human digestive system  substances of food into simpler ones.

The first set of teeth  grows  during  infancy  and  they  fall  off  at  the  age  between  six  to  eight years. These are termed milk teeth. The second set that replaces them are the permanent  teeth.  The  permanent  teeth  may  last  throughout  life  or  fall  off during old age or due to some dental disease.  Boojho is fascinated by the highly coiled small intestine seen in Fig. 2.2. He wants to know its length. Would you like to make a wild guess? We have given its approximate length on page 16.

Discuss  the  results  with  your classmates and your teacher. The saliva breaks down the starch into sugars.  The  tongue  is  a  fleshy  muscular organ attached at the back to the floor of the buccal cavity. It is free at the front and can be moved in all directions. Do you know the functions of the tongue? We use our tongue for talking. Besides, it  mixes  saliva  with  the  food  during chewing and helps in swallowing food. We  also  taste  food  with  our  tongue.  It has  taste  buds  that  detect  different tastes  of  food.  We  can  find  out  the  Sweets and tooth decay  Normally bacteria are present in our mouth but they are not harmful to us. However, if we do not clean our teeth and mouth after eating, many harmful bacteria also begin to live and grow in it. These bacteria break down the sugars present from the leftover food and release acids (see Chapter 4 to know what an acid is). The acids gradually damage the teeth (Fig. 2.5). This is called tooth decay. If it is not treated  in  time,  it  causes  severe  toothache  and  in  extreme  cases results in tooth loss. Chocolates, sweets, soft drinks and other sugar products are the major culprits of tooth decay.  Therefore, one should clean the teeth with a brush or datun and dental floss (a special strong thread which is moved between two teeth  to  take  out  trapped  food  particles)  at  least  twice  a  day  and rinse  the  mouth  after  every  meal.  Also,  one  should  not  put  dirty fingers or any unwashed object in the mouth.

This happens when food particles enter the windpipe. The windpipe carries air from the nostrils to the lungs. It runs adjacent to the foodpipe. But inside the throat, air and food share a common passage. Then  how  is  food  prevented  from  entering  the  windpipe?  During  the  act  of swallowing a flap-like valve closes the passage of the windpipe and guides the food into the foodpipe. If, by chance, food particles enter the windpipe, we feel choked, get hiccups or cough.  Fig. 2.6  Regions of the tongue for different tastes  position of taste buds by the following activity.

Food is pushed down by movement  of  the  wall  of  the  foodpipe. Actually  this  movement  takes  place throughout  the  alimentary  canal  and pushes the food downwards (Fig.  2.7). At times the food is not accepted by our stomach and is vomited out. Recall the instances when you vomited after eating and think of the reason for it. Discuss with your parents and teacher.  The  stomach  The stomach is a thick-walled bag. Its shape is like a flattened J and it is the widest part of the alimentary canal. It receives food from the food pipe at one end and opens into the small intestine at the other.  The  inner  lining  of  the  stomach secretes mucous, hydrochloric acid and digestive  juices.  The  mucous  protects the lining of the stomach. The acid kills many bacteria that enter along with the  food  and  makes  the  medium  in  the stomach acidic and helps the digestive juices to act. The digestive juices break down  the  proteins   into  simpler substances.  The small intestine The small intestine is highly coiled and is  about  7.5  metres  long.  It  receives secretions from the liver and the pancreas. Besides, its wall also secretes juices.  The  liver  is  a  reddish  brown  gland situated  in  the  upper  part  of  the abdomen  on  the  right  side.  It  is  the largest gland in the body. It secretes bile juice that is stored in a sac called the gall  bladder  (Fig.  2.2).  The  bile  plays an important role in the digestion of fats. The  pancreas  is  a  large  cream coloured  gland  located  just  below  the stomach (Fig. 2.2). The pancreatic juice acts on carbohydrates, fats and proteins and changes them into simpler forms.  The  working  of  the  stomach  was  discovered  by  a strange accident. In 1822, a man named Alexis St. Martin was badly hit by a shot gun. The bullet had seriously damaged the chest wall and made a hole in  his  stomach.  He  was  brought  to  an  American army doctor William Beaumont. The doctor saved the patient but he could not close the hole properly and left it bandaged (Fig. 2.8). Beaumont took it as a great opportunity to see the inside of the stomach through  the  hole.  He  made  some  wonderful observations.  Beaumont found that the stomach was churning food.  Its  wall  secreted  a  fluid  which  could  digest the food. He also observed that the end of the stomach opens into the intestine only after the digestion of the food inside the stomach is completed.  Fig. 2.8  Alexis St. Martin’s shotgun wound  16  SCIENCE  Rationalised 2023-24The partly digested food now reaches the lower part of the small intestine where the  intestinal  juice  completes  the digestion of all components of the food. The  carbohydrates  get  broken  into simple sugars such as glucose, fats into fatty  acids  and  glycerol,  and  proteins into amino acids.  Absorption in the small intestine The digested food can now pass into the blood vessels in the wall of the intestine. This process is called absorption. The inner walls of the small intestine have thousands  of  finger-like  outgrowths. These  are  called  villi  (singular  villus). Can you guess what the role of villi could be  in  the  intestine?  The  villi  increase the  surface  area  for  absorption  of  the digested food. Each villus has a network of thin and small blood vessels close to its  surface.  The  surface  of  the  villi absorbs the digested food materials. The absorbed  substances  are  transported via the blood vessels to different organs of the body where they are used to build complex  substances  such  as  the  proteins required by the body. This is called assimilation. In the cells, glucose breaks  down  with  the  help  of  oxygen into  carbon  dioxide  and  water,  and energy  is  released.  The  food  that remains  undigested  and  unabsorbed enters into the large intestine.  Large  intestine  The large intestine is wider and shorter than small intestine. It is about 1.5 metre in length. Its function is to absorb  water and some salts from the undigested food material.  The  remaining  waste  passes into  the  rectum  and  remains  there  as semi-solid faeces. The faecal matter is removed  through  the  anus  from time-to-time. This is called egestion.  2.3 DIGESTION IN GRASS-EATING  ANIMALS  Have  you  observed  cows,  buffaloes a n d   o t h e r   g r a s s - e a t i n g   a n i m a l s chewing  continuously  even  when they  are  not  eating?  Actually,  they quickly swallow the grass and store it  in  a  part  of  the  stomach  called rumen (Fig. 2.9). Here the food gets  Diarrhoea  Sometime you may have experienced the need to pass watery stool frequently. This condition is known as diarrhoea. It may be caused by an infection, food poisoning or indigestion. It is very common in India, particularly among children. Under severe conditions it can be fatal. This is because of the excessive loss of water and salts from the body. Diarrhoea should not be neglected. Even before a doctor is consulted the patient should be given plenty of boiled and cooled water with a pinch of salt and sugar dissolved in it. This is called Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS).

But later the cud returns to the mouth in  small  lumps  and  the  animal  chews it. This process is called rumination and these animals are called ruminants.  The grass is rich in cellulose, a type of carbohydrate. In ruminants like cattle, deer,  etc.,  bacteria  present  in  rumen  Oesophagus  Small  Intestine  Rumen  helps  in  digestion  of  cellulose.  Many animals,  including  humans,  cannot digest cellulose.  Animals like horses, rabbit, etc., have a large sac-like structure called Caecum between the oesophagus and the small intestine (Fig. 2.9). The cellulose of the food  is  digested  here  by  the  action  of certain bacteria which are not present in humans.  So far you have learnt about animals which possess the digestive system. But there are many small organisms which do not have a mouth and a digestive system. Then,  how  do  they  acquire  and  digest food? In the section below you will learn another interesting way of food intake.  2.4 FEEDING AND DIGESTION IN  AMOEBA  Amoeba is a microscopic single-celled organism found in pond water. Amoeba has a cell membrane, a rounded, dense nucleus  and  many  small  bubble-like vacuoles  (Fig.  2.10)  in  its  cytoplasm. Amoeba  constantly  changes  its  shape and  position.  It  pushes  out  one,  or more  finger-like  projections,  called pseudopodia or false feet for movement and capture of food.  Nucleus  Pseudopodium  Food particle (ingestion)  Food vacuole  Stomach  Large  Intestine  Caecum  Fig. 2.9  Digestive system of ruminant  18  Fig. 2.10  Amoeba  Egested waste  SCIENCE  Rationalised 2023-24Amoeba feeds on some microscopic organisms.  When  it  senses  food,  it pushes  out  pseudopodia  around  the food  particle  and  engulfs  it.  The  food becomes  trapped  in  a  food  vacuole [Fig. 2.10).  Digestive juices are secreted into the food vacuole. They act on the food and break it down into simpler substances. Gradually the digested food is absorbed.  The absorbed substances are used for growth,  maintenance  and  multiplication. The  undigested  residue  of  the  food  is expelled outside by the vacuole.  The  basic  process  of  digestion  of food and release of energy is the same in  all  animals.  In  a  later  chapter  you will  learn  about  the  transport  of  food absorbed by the intestine to the various parts of the body.

It  consists  of  the  (i)  buccal  cavity,  (ii)  oesophagus, (iii) stomach, (iv) small intestine, (v) large intestine ending in rectum and (vi) anus. The main digestive glands which secrete digestive juices are (i) the salivary glands, (ii) the liver and (iii) the pancreas. The stomach wall and the wall of the small intestine also secrete digestive juices.   The modes of feeding vary in different organisms.   Nutrition  is  a  complex  process  involving:  (i)  ingestion,  (ii)  digestion,  (iii) absorption, (iv) assimilation and  (v) egestion.  NUTRITION IN ANIMALS  19  Rationalised 2023-24 Digestion of carbohydrates, like starch, begins in the buccal cavity. The digestion of protein starts in the stomach. The bile secreted from the liver,  the  pancreatic  juice  from  the  pancreas  and  the  digestive  juice from the intestinal wall complete the digestion of all components of food in the small intestine. The digested food is absorbed in the blood vessels from the small intestine.   The absorbed substances are transported to different parts of the body. Water  and  some  salts  are  absorbed  from  the  undigested  food  in  the large intestine.   The undigested and unabsorbed residues are expelled out of the body  as faeces through the anus.   The  grazing  animals  like  cows,  buffaloes  and  deer  are  known  as ruminants. They quickly ingest, swallow their leafy food and store it in the rumen. Later, the food returns to the mouth and the animal chews it peacefully.   Amoeba ingests its food with the help of its false feet or pseudopodia.  The food is digested in the food vacuole.

We wear woollen clothes  during  winters  when  it  is  cold outside. Woollen clothes keep us warm. We prefer to wear light coloured cotton clothes when it is hot. These give us a feeling  of  coolness.  You  might  have wondered  why  particular  types  of clothes  are  suitable  for  a  particular season.  In  winter  you  feel  cold  inside  the house. If you come out in the sun, you feel warm. In summer, you feel hot even inside  the  house.  How  do  we  know whether an object is hot or cold? How do we find out how hot or cold an object is? In this chapter we shall try to seek answers to some of these questions.  3.1  HOT AND COLD  and some of them are cold.  Tea is hot and  ice  is  cold.  List  some  objects  you use commonly in Table 3.1. Mark these objects as hot or cold.  Do  not  touch  objects  which  are  too hot.  Be  careful  while  handling  a candle flame or a stove.  We  see  that  some  objects  are  cold while some are hot. You also know that some  objects  are  hotter  than  others while some are colder than others.  How do we decide which object is hotter than the  other?  We  often  do  it  by  touching the  objects.  But  is  our  sense  of  touch reliable? Let us find out.  Activity  3.1  Take three small tubs/containers. Label them as A, B and C. Put cold water in container A and hot water in container  In our day-to-day life, we come across a number of objects. Some of them are hot  Make sure that water is not so hot that you burn your hand  Table 3.1:  Hot and cold objects  Object  Cold/Cool Warm/Hot  (A)  (B)  (C)    Ice  cream  Spoon in a tea cup  Fruit juice  Handle of a frying pan  Fig. 3.1   Feeling water in three containers  Rationalised 2023-24B.  Mix  some  cold  and  hot  water  in container C.  Now dip your left hand in container  A  and  the  right  hand  in container B. After keeping the hands in the two containers for 2–3 minutes, put both  the  hands  simultaneously  in container  C  (Fig.  3.1).    Do  both  the hands get the same feeling?  Boojho says,“My left hand tells me that the water in mug C is hot and the right hand tells me that the same water is cold.  What should I conclude?”  Boojho’s  confusion  shows  that  we cannot always rely on our sense of touch to decide whether an object is  hot  or  cold.  Sometimes it may deceive us.  Then,  how  do  we  find out how hot an object really is? A reliable measure of the hotness  of  an  object  is  its temperature. Temperature is measured  by  a  device  called thermometer.  3.2 MEASURING TEMPERATURE Have  you  seen  a  thermometer?  Recall that when you or someone else in your family had fever, the temperature was measured  by  a  thermometer.  The thermometer  that  measures  our  body temperature  is  called  a  clinical thermometer. Hold the thermometer in  Fig. 3.2  A clinical thermom- eter  your hand and examine it carefully. If you do not have a thermometer, request a friend to share it with you. A clinical thermometer looks like the one shown in Fig. 3.2.  A clinical thermometer consists of a long, narrow, uniform glass tube. It has a bulb at one end. This bulb contains mercury.  Outside  the  bulb,  a  small shining thread of mercury can be seen. If you do not see the mercury thread, rotate the thermometer a bit till you see it.    You  will  also  find  a  scale  on  the thermometer.  The  scale  we  use  is  the celsius scale, indicated by °C.  Boojho wondered which of the two scales shown in Fig. 3.2 he should read.  Paheli told him that India has adopted the celsius scale and we should read that scale.  The other scale with the range 94–108 degrees is the Fahrenheit scale (°F). It was in use earlier.  A  clinical  thermometer  reads  temperature from 35°C to 42°C.  Activity  3.2  Reading  a  thermometer Let us learn how to read a thermometer. First,  note  the  temperature  difference indicated between the two bigger marks. Also note down the number of divisions  HEAT  25  Rationalised 2023-24Precautions to be observed while using a clinical thermometer   Thermometer  should  be  washed  before  and  after  use,  preferably  with  an  antiseptic solution.   Ensure that before use the mercury level is below 35°C.  Read the thermometer keeping the level of mercury along the line of sight.  (See Fig. 3.3).   Handle the thermometer with care. If it hits against some hard object, it can  break.   Don’t hold the thermometer by the bulb while reading it.  (shown by smaller marks) between these marks.  Suppose the bigger marks read one degree and there are five divisions between them.  Then, one small division  can read   1 5     0.2 C  .  Wash  the  thermometer,  preferably with  an  antiseptic  solution.  Hold  it firmly and give it a few jerks. The jerks will  bring  the  level  of  mercury  down. Ensure  that  it  falls  below  35°C.    Now place  the  bulb  of  the  thermometer  under  your  tongue.  After  one  minute, take the thermometer out and note the reading.  This is your body temperature. The  temperature  should  always  be stated with its unit, °C.  What  did  you  record  as  your  body  temperature?  The normal temperature of human body is 37°C. Note that the temperature is stated with its unit.  Paheli measured her body temperature. She got worried as it was not exactly 37°C.  Let us try to assure Paheli that there  is nothing wrong with her.  Activity  3.3  Measure the body temperature of some of  your  friends  (at  least  10)  with  a  Table 3.2: Body temperature of some persons  Name  Temperature (°C)  Fig. 3.3  Correct method of reading a clinical thermometer  26  SCIENCE  Rationalised 2023-24clinical  thermometer.  Record  your observations as in Table 3.2.  Is  the  body  temperature  of  every  person 37°C?  The temperature of every person may not be 37°C.  It could be slightly higher or slightly lower.  Actually, what we call normal temperature is the average body temperature of a large number of healthy persons.  The clinical thermometer is designed to measure the temperature of human body only.  The temperature of human body normally does not go below 35oC or  above  42 oC.  That  is  the  reason that  this  thermometer  has  the  range 35oC to 42oC.  Boojho got a naughty idea.  He wanted to measure the temperature of hot milk using a clinical thermometer.  Paheli stopped him from doing so.  Different types of thermometers are used for different purposes. The  maximum  and  minimum temperatures  of  the  previous day,  reported  in  weather reports,  are  measured  by  a the thermometer  called  m a x i m u m - m i n i m u m thermometer.  this  thermometer.    Look  at  it carefully and note the highest and the  lowest  temperature  it  can measure.  The  range  of  a laboratory  thermometer  is generally  from  –10°C  to  110°C (Fig. 3.4).

You  would  need  this information  the thermometer correctly.  read   to   Let  us  now  learn  how  this  thermometer is used.  CAUTION  Activity  3.4  Do not use a clinical thermometer for measuring  the  temperature  of  any object  other  than  the  human  body. Also avoid keeping the thermometer in the sun or near a flame. It may break.  3.3 LABORATORY THERMOMETER How do we measure the temperature of other  objects?  For  this  purpose,  there are  other  thermometers.  One  such thermometer is known as the laboratory thermometer.  The teacher will show you  Take some tap water in a beaker or a mug.  Dip the thermometer in  water  so  that  the  bulb  is immersed  in  water  but  does  not touch the bottom or the sides of the  the container.  Hold  thermometer vertically (Fig. 3.5). Observe the movement of mercury in the thermometer.  Wait till the mercury thread becomes steady.  Fig. 3.4  A laboratory thermometer  HEAT  27  Rationalised 2023-24In addition to the precautions to be taken while reading a clinical thermometer, the laboratory thermometer   should be kept upright not tilted. (Fig. 3.5)  bulb  should  be  surrounded  from  all  sides  by  the  substance  of  which  the temperature is to be measured. The bulb should not touch the surface of the container.  Are  there  any  variations  in  the readings? Discuss the possible reasons. Let us try to answer this question.  Activity  3.5  Take  some  hot  water  in  a  beaker  or  a mug.    Dip  the  thermometer  in  water. Wait  till  the  mercury  thread  becomes steady and note the temperature.  Now take  out  the  thermometer  from  water. Observe  carefully  what  happens  now. Do you notice that as soon as you take the thermometer out of water, the level of mercury begins to fall.  This means that the temperature must be read while the thermometer is in water.  You may recall that while taking your own temperature, you have to take the thermometer out of your mouth to note the  reading.  Can  you  then  use  the laboratory thermometer to measure your  Boojho wonders why the level of mercury should change at  all when the bulb of the  thermometer is brought in contact with another object?  Fig. 3.5  Measuring temperature of water with a laboratory thermometer  Note the reading. This is the temperature of water at that time.  Compare  the  temperature  of  water recorded by each student in the class.  Boojho now understands why clinical thermometer cannot be used to measure high temperatures. But still wonders whether a laboratory thermometer can be used to measure his body temperature.  28  SCIENCE  Rationalised 2023-24body temperature?  Obviously, it is not convenient  to  use  the  laboratory thermometer for this purpose.  Why does the mercury not fall or rise in  a  clinical  thermometer  when  taken out of the mouth?  Observe  a  clinical  thermometer again. Do you see a kink near the bulb (Fig. 3.6).  What  is  the  use  of  the  kink?  It prevents mercury level from falling on its own.  Fig. 3.6  A clinical thermometer has a kink in it  There is a lot of concern over the  use  of  mercury  in thermometers. Mercury is a toxic substance and is very difficult  to  dispose  of  if  a thermometer breaks. These days,  digital  thermometers are  available  which  do  not use mercury.  3.4 TRANSFER OF HEAT You might have observed that a frying pan becomes hot when kept on a flame. It is because the heat passes from the flame  to  the  utensil.  When  the  pan  is removed  from  the  fire,  it  slowly  cools down.  Why does it cool down?  The heat is  transferred  from  the  pan  to  the surroundings.  So you can understand that in both cases, the heat flows from a hotter object to a colder object. In fact,  Paheli asks: “Does it mean  that heat will not be transferred if the temperature of two objects is the same?”  in  all  cases  heat  flows  from  a  hotter object to a colder object.  How  does  heat  flow?    Let  us  investigate.  Activity  3.6  Take a rod or flat strip of a metal, say of aluminium or iron.  Fix a few small wax pieces on the rod.  These pieces should be at nearly equal distances (Fig. 3.7). Clamp the rod to a stand. If you do not find a stand, you can   put one end of the  rod  in  between  bricks.    Now,  heat the other end of the rod and observe.  What happens to the wax pieces?  Do these pieces begin to fall? Which piece falls the first? Do you think that heat is  Fig. 3.7  Flow of heat through a metal strip  transferred from the end nearest to the flame to the other end?  The  process  by  which  heat  is transferred from the hotter end to the colder  end  of  an  object  is  known  as conduction.  In  solids,  generally,  the  HEAT  29  Rationalised 2023-24minutes.  Touch  the  other  end.  Enter your observation in Table 3.3.  The  materials  which  allow  heat  to pass  through  them  easily  are conductors  of  heat.  For  examples, aluminum,  iron  and  copper.  The materials  which  do  not  allow  heat  to pass  through  them  easily  are  poor conductors of heat such as plastic and wood.  Poor  conductors  are  known  as insulators.  The  water  and  air  are  poor conductors of heat. Then, how does the heat  transfer  take  place  in  these substances?  Let us find out.  Activity  3.8  Take  a  round  bottom  flask  (if  flask  is not available, a beaker can be used).  Fill it  two-thirds  with  water.  Place  it  on  a tripod,  or  make  some  arrangement  to place the flask in such a way that you can heat it by placing a candle below it. Wait  till  the  water  in  the  flask  is still.  Place  a  crystal  of  potassium permanganate at the bottom of the flask gently using a straw. Now, heat the water by  placing  the  candle  just  below  the crystal.  Write  your  observation  in  your notebook  and  also  draw  a  picture  of what you observe (Fig. 3.9). When  water  is  heated, the water near the flame gets hot.    Hot  water  rises  up. The  cold  water  from  the sides  moves  down  towards the  source  of  heat.  This water also gets hot and rises  Fig. 3.8  Conduction of heat by different materials  heat  is  transferred  by  the  process  of conduction.  Do  all  substances  conduct  heat easily?   You must have observed that the metallic pan for cooking has a plastic or  wooden  handle.    Can  you  lift  a  hot pan  by  holding  it  from  the  handle without getting hurt?  Activity  3.7  Heat water in a small pan or a beaker. Collect  some  articles  such  as  a  steel spoon, plastic scale, pencil and divider. Dip one end of each of these articles in hot  water  (Fig.  3.8).  Wait  for  a  few  Article  Table 3.3  Material  with which the article is made of  Does  the  other end get hot Yes/No  Steel spoon  Metal  Yes  30  SCIENCE  Rationalised 2023-24Fig. 3.10  Transfer of heat by convection in air  Notice that towards the top, the air gets heated by convection. Therefore, the hand above the flame feels hot. On the sides,  however,  there  is  no  convection and  air  does  not  feel  as  hot  as  at the top.   The people living in the coastal areas experience an interesting phenomenon. During  the  day,  the  land  gets  heated faster than the water. The air over the land becomes hotter and rises up. The cooler air from the sea rushes in towards the land to take its place. The warm air from the land moves towards the sea to complete  the  cycle  (Fig.  3.11).  The  air from the sea is called the sea breeze. To receive the cooler sea breeze, the windows of the houses in coastal areas are made to face the sea.  At night it is exactly the reverse.  The  water  cools  down  more slowly  than  the  land.  So,  the  cool  air from  the  land  moves  towards  the  sea. This is called the land breeze.  When  we  come  out  in  the  sun,  we feel warm. How does the heat from the sun  reach  us?  It  cannot  reach  us  by conduction or convection as there is no medium such as air in most part of the space between the earth and the sun.  Fig. 3.9  Convection of heat in water  and water from the sides moves down. This  process  continues  till  the  whole water  gets  heated.  This  mode  of  heat transfer is known as convection.  How does the heat travel in air?  In  which direction does the smoke go?  The air near the heat source gets hot and rises.  The air from the sides comes in to take its place. In this way the air gets  heated.  The  following  activity confirms this idea.  Activity  3.9  Light a candle. Keep one hand above the flame and one hand on the side of the flame    (Fig.  3.10).  Do  your  hands  feel equally  hot?    If  not  which  hand  feels hotter?  And why?  Be careful.  Keep your hands at a safe distance from the flame so that they do not get burnt.  HEAT  31  Rationalised 2023-24Day time  Night time  Cool  Hot  Hot  Cool  Fig. 3.11  Sea breeze and Land  breeze  From the sun the heat comes to us by another  process  known  as  radiation. The transfer of heat by radiation does not  require  any  medium.  It  can  take place whether a medium is present or not.  When  we  sit  in  front  of  a  room heater,  we  get  heat  by  this  process.  A hot  utensil  kept  away  from  the  flame cools  down  as  it  transfers  heat  to  the surroundings  by  radiation.  Our  body too, gives heat to the surroundings and receives heat from it by radiation.  All  hot  bodies  radiate  heat.    When this heat falls on some object, a part of it is reflected, a part is absorbed and a part  may  be  transmitted.  The temperature of the object increases due to the absorbed part of the heat. Why  are you advised to use an umbrella when you go out in the sun?  3.5 KINDS OF CLOTHES WE WEAR IN  SUMMER AND WINTER  You  know  that  in  summer  we  prefer light-coloured clothes and in winter we usually wear dark-coloured clothes. Why is it so? Let us find out  Activity  3.10  Take two identical tin cans.  Paint the outer  surface  of  one  black  and  of  the other  white  (Fig.  3.12).  Pour  equal amounts of water in each and leave them in the mid-day sun for about an hour. Measure  the  temperature  of  water  in both  the  cans.  Do  you  find  any difference  in  the  temperatures?    In  32  SCIENCE  Rationalised 2023-24We often use electricity and fuels like coal and wood to keep our houses cool or warm. Is it possible to construct buildings, that are not affected much by heat and cold outside? This can be done by constructing outer walls of buildings so that  they  have  trapped  layers  of  air.  One  way  of  doing  this  is  to  use  hollow bricks, which are available these days.  the summer and dark-coloured clothes in  the  winter?  Dark  surfaces  absorb more  heat  and,  therefore,  we  feel comfortable with dark coloured clothes in  the  winter.  Light  coloured  clothes reflect most of the heat that falls on them and, therefore, we feel more comfortable wearing them in the summer.  Woollen clothes keep us warm in winter  In  the  winter,  we  use  woollen  clothes. Wool  is  a  poor  conductor  of  heat. Moreover, there is air trapped in between the wool fibres. This air prevents the flow of  heat  from  our  body  to  the  cold surroundings. So, we feel warm.  Suppose you are given the choice in winter of using either one thick blanket or  two  thin  blankets  joined  together. What  would  you  choose  and  why? Remember that there would be a layer of air in between the blankets.  Fig. 3.12  Containers with black and white surface  which  can  is  the  water  warmer?    You can feel the difference even by touching water in the two cans.  Activity  3.11  Fill the two cans used in Activity 3.10 with the same amount of hot water at the  same  temperature  (say,  at  60oC). Leave the cans in a room or in a shade. Note  the  temperature  of  water  after 10–15 minutes.  Does the temperature of water in both the cans fall by the same amount?  Do these activities suggest to you the reason  why  it  is  more  comfortable  to wear white or light-coloured clothes in  Keywords  Celsius scale Conduction Conductor Convection  Insulator Land breeze Radiation  Sea breeze  Temperature  Thermometer  HEAT  33  Rationalised 2023-24What you have learnt   Our sense of touch is not always a reliable guide to the degree of hotness  of an object.   Temperature is a measure of the degree of hotness of an object.   Thermometer is a device used for measuring temperature.   Clinical thermometer is used to measure our body temperature. The range of this thermometer is from 35°C to 42°C.  For other purposes, we use the laboratory thermometers. The range of these thermometers is usually from –10°C to 110°C.   The normal temperature of the human body is 37°C.   The heat flows from a body at a higher temperature to a body at a lower temperature.  There  are  three  ways  in  which  heat  can  flow  from  one object to another. These are conduction, convection and radiation.    In solids, generally, the heat is transferred by conduction. In liquids and gases the heat is transferred by convection. No medium is required for transfer of heat by radiation.   The  materials  which  allow  heat  to  pass  through  them  easily  are  conductors of heat.   The materials which do not allow heat to pass through them easily are  called insulators.   Dark-coloured objects absorb more heat than the light-coloured objects. That is the reason we feel more comfortable in light-coloured clothes in the summer.   Woollen clothes keep us warm during winter. It is so because wool is a poor conductor of heat and it has air trapped in between the fibres.  Exercises  1. State similarities and differences between the laboratory thermometer  and the clinical thermometer.  2. Give two examples each of conductors and insulators of heat.  3.

3,3,0,"Acids, Bases and Salts  4 We use in our daily life a large  number  of  substances  such as lemon, tamarind, common salt,  sugar  and  vinegar.  Do  they  have the same taste? Let us recall tastes of some  edible  substances  listed  in Table 4.1. If you have not tasted any of these substances taste it now and enter the result in Table 4.1.  CAUTION  1. Do not taste anything unless asked  to do so.  2. Do not touch anything unless asked  to do so.  Table 4.1  Taste  (sour/bitter/ any  other)  Substance  Lemon  juice  Orange  juice  Vinegar  Curd  Tamarind  (imli)  Sugar  Common  salt  Amla  Baking  soda  Grapes  Unripe mango   Cucumber  You  find  that  some  of  these substances taste sour, some taste bitter, some taste sweet and some taste salty.  4.1 ACIDS AND BASES Curd,  lemon  juice,  orange  juice  and vinegar  taste  sour.  These  substances taste sour because they contain acids. The chemical nature of such substances is acidic. The word acid comes from the Latin  word  acere  which  means  sour. The  acids  in  these  substances  are natural acids.  What about baking soda? Does it also taste sour? If not, what is its taste? Since, it  does not taste sour it means, that it has no acids in it. It is bitter in taste. If you rub its solution between fingers, it feels  soapy. Generally,  substances  like these which are bitter in taste and feel soapy on touching are known as bases. The nature of such substances is said to be basic.  If we cannot taste every substance,  how do we find its nature?  Special type of substances are used to test whether a substance is acidic or basic. These substances are known as indicators. The indicators change their colour  when  added  to  a  solution containing  an  acidic  or  a  basic substance. Turmeric, litmus, China rose petals  (Gudhal),  etc.,  are  some  of  the naturally occurring indicators.  Rationalised 2023-24Name  of  acid Acetic acid  Formic acid  Citric acid  Do you know?

No. Have you not read the caution? We should not taste unknown substances. They could harm us.  4.2 NATURAL INDICATORS  AROUND US  Litmus: A natural dye The  most  commonly  used  natural indicator  is  litmus.  It  is  extracted from  lichens  (Fig.  4.1a).  It  has  a mauve  (purple)  colour  in  distilled water.  When  added  to  an  acidic solution,  it  turns  red  and  when added  to  a  basic  solution,  it  turns blue. It is available in the form of a solution, or in the form of strips of paper,  known  as  litmus  paper. Generally, it is available as red and blue litmus paper (Fig. 4.1b).

Is there any change in colour?   Repeat  the  same  exercise  with  the  blue litmus paper. Note down if there is any change in  colour.  Perform  the  same  activity  with  the  following substances:  Tap water, detergent solution, aerated drink, soap solution, shampoo, common salt  solution,  sugar  solution,  vinegar, baking soda solution, milk of magnesia, washing  soda  solution,  lime  water.  If possible make solutions in distilled water. Record  your  observations  as  in  Table. 4.2.  In  your  Table,  are  there  any substances  on  which  litmus  had  no effect? Name those substances.  The solutions which do not change the colour of either red or blue litmus are known as neutral solutions. These substances are neither acidic nor basic.

Add a little water and make a paste.   Make  turmeric  paper  by  depositing turmeric paste on blotting paper/filter paper and drying it. Cut thin strips of the yellow paper obtained.   Put  a  drop  of  soap  solution  on  the  strip of turmeric paper. What do you observe?  To prepare limewater, take some water in a tumbler and add some lime (chuna) into it. Stir the solution and keep it for some time. Pour a little from the top. This is lime water.  Table 4.2  S.

As the name indicates the rain containing excess of acids is called an acid rain. Where do these acids come from? The rain becomes acidic because carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide (which are released into the air as pollutants) dissolve in rain drops to form carbonic acid, sulphuric acid  and  nitric  acid  respectively.  Acid  rain  can  cause  damage  to  buildings, historical monuments, plants and animals.  CAUTION  Great  care  should  be  taken  while handling laboratory acids and bases because these are corrosive in nature, irritating and harmful to skin.  Demonstrate  the  effect  of  the  three indicators  on  each  of  these  solutions. Record your observations in Table 4.5.  4.3 NEUTRALISATION We  have  learnt  that  acids  turn  blue litmus  red  and  bases  turn  red  litmus blue. Let us see what happens when an acid is mixed with a base.  We are going to use an indicator you have  not  used  so  far.  It  is  called phenolphthalein.  Activity  4.5  To be demonstrated by the teacher in the class  Fill one fourth of a test tube with dilute hydrochloric acid. Note down its colour. Note down the colour of phenolphthalein solution  also.  Add  2–3  drops  of  the indicator to the acid. Now shake the test tube gently. Do you observe any change in colour of the acid?  Add to the acidic solution a drop of sodium hydroxide solution by a dropper.  Stir the tube gently. Is there any change in the colour of the solution? Continue adding  the  sodium  hydroxide  solution drop by drop while stirring till the pink colour just appears.  Now  add  one  more  drop  of  dilute hydrochloric acid. What do you observe? The solution again becomes colourless. Again  add  one  drop  of  sodium hydroxide solution. Is there any change in colour? The solution again becomes pink in colour.  It is evident that when the solution is  basic,  phenolphthalein  gives  a  pink colour.  On  the  other  hand,  when  the solution is acidic, it remains colourless.  Base  Acid + Indicator  Fig. 4.4  Process of neutralisation  ACIDS, BASES AND SALTS  43  Rationalised 2023-24When  an  acidic  solution  is  mixed with a basic solution, both the solutions neutralise the effect of each other. When an acid solution and a base solution are mixed  in  suitable  amounts,  both  the acidic nature of the acid and the basic nature  of  the  base  are  destroyed.  The resulting solution is neither acidic nor basic. Touch the test tube immediately after  neutralisation.  What  do  you observe? In neutralisation reaction, heat is  always  produced,  or  evolved.  The evolved heat raises the temperature of the reaction mixture.  In  neutralisation  reaction  a  new substance is formed. This is called salt. Salt may be acidic, basic or neutral in nature.  Thus,  neutralisation  can  be defined as follows:  The reaction between an acid and a base is known as neutralisation. Salt and water are produced in this process with the evolution of heat. Acid+Base  Salt+Water       (Heat is evolved) The following reaction is an example: Hydrochloric acid (HCl) + Sodium  hydroxide (NaOH)   Sodium chloride (NaCl) + Water (H2O) Boojho added dilute sulphuric acid to lime water. Will the reaction mixture become hot or cool?  4.4 NEUTRALISATION IN EVERYDAY  LIFE  Indigestion Our  stomach  contains  hydrochloric acid. It helps us to digest food, as you  have  learnt  in  Chapter  2.  But  too much  of  acid  in  the  stomach  causes indigestion.  Sometimes  indigestion is  painful.  To  relieve  indigestion,  we take  an  antacid  such  as  milk  of magnesia,  which contains  magnesium hydroxide.  It  neutralises  the  effect  of excessive acid.  Ant  bite  it   injects When  an  ant  bites,  the  acidic  liquid  (formic  acid)  into  the skin.  The  effect  of  the  acid  can  be neutralised  by  rubbing  moist  baking soda  (sodium  hydrogencarbonate)  or calamine solution, which contains zinc carbonate.  Soil  treatment  Excessive  use  of  chemical  fertilisers makes  the  soil  acidic.  Plants  do  not grow well when the soil is either too acidic or too basic. When the soil is too acidic, it is treated with bases like quick  lime  (calcium  oxide)  or  slaked lime  (calcium  hydroxide).  If  the  soil is  basic,  organic  matter  (compost)  is added  to  it.  Organic  matter  releases acids  which  neutralises  the  basic nature of the soil.  Factory  wastes  factories The  wastes  of  many  contain  acids.  If  they  are  allowed  to flow  into  the  water  bodies,  the  acids will  kill  fish  and  other  organisms. The  factory  wastes  are,  therefore, neutralised  by  adding  basic substances.  44  SCIENCE  Rationalised 2023-24Keywords  Acid Acidic Base  What you have learnt  Basic Indicator Neutral  Neutralisation Salt   Acids are sour in taste.

4,4,0,"Physical  and Chemical  Changes  5 Every day you come across many  changes  in  your  surroundings. These changes may involve one or more substances.  For example, your mother may ask you to dissolve sugar in water to make a cold drink. Making a sugar  solution  is  a  change.  Similarly, setting  curd  from  milk  is  a  change. Sometimes milk becomes sour.  Souring of  milk  is  a  change.  Stretched  rubber band also represents a change.  Make a list of ten changes you have  noticed around you.  In this chapter we shall perform some activities and study the nature of these changes.  Broadly, these changes are of two kinds, physical and chemical.  5.1  PHYSICAL CHANGES  Activity  5.1  Cut  a  piece  of  paper  in  four  square pieces.  Cut  each  square  piece  further into four square pieces.  Lay these pieces on the floor or a table so that the pieces acquire the shape of the original piece of paper (Fig. 5.1).  Obviously, you cannot join the pieces back to make the original piece, but is there  a  change  in  the  property  of  the paper?  Activity  5.2  Collect the chalk dust lying on the floor near the chalkboard in your classroom. Or,  crush  a  small  piece  of  chalk  into dust.  Add  a  little  water  to  the  dust  to make a paste. Roll it into the shape of a piece of chalk. Let it dry.  Did  you  recover  chalk  from  the  dust?  Activity  5.3  Take  some  ice  in  a  glass  or  plastic tumbler. Melt a small portion of ice by placing the tumbler in the sun. You have now  a  mixture  of  ice  and  water.  Now place the tumbler in a freezing mixture (ice plus common salt).  Does the water become solid ice once  Fig. 5.1   Paper pieces  again?

Hold  an  inverted  pan  by  its handle over the steam at some distance from  the  boiling  water.    Observe  the inner surface of the pan.  Do  you  see  any  droplet  of  water  there?  Activity  5.5  CAUTION  Be careful while handling a flame.  Hold a used hack-saw blade with a pair  of  tongs.  Keep  the  tip  of  the  free end of the blade on the gas stove. Wait for a few minutes.  Does the colour of the tip of the blade  change?  Remove  the  blade  from  the  flame. Observe the tip once again after some time.  Does it get back its original colour? In Activities 5.1 and 5.2 above, you saw  that  paper  and  a  piece  of  chalk underwent changes in size. In Activities  5.3 and 5.4, water changed its state (from solid to liquid, or from gas to liquid). In Activity  5.5,  the  hack-saw  blade changed colour on heating.  Properties such as shape, size, colour and state of a substance are called its physical properties. A change in which a substance undergoes a change in its physical properties is called a physical change. A physical change is generally reversible.  In  such  a  change  no  new substance is formed.  Let us now consider the other kind  of change.  5.2  CHEMICAL CHANGE A  change  with  which  you  are  quite familiar  is  the  rusting  of  iron.    If  you leave a piece of iron in the open for some time,  it  acquires  a  film  of  brownish substance.  This substance is called rust and  the  process  is  called  rusting (Fig.  5.2).  Iron  gates  of  parks  or farmlands, iron benches kept in lawns and gardens, almost every article of iron, kept in the open gets rusted.

On the basis of this test, how do you classify the aqueous solution — acidic or basic?  On  dissolving  the  ash  in  water  it forms a new substance. This change can be written in the form of the following equation:  Magnesium  oxide  (MgO)  +  Water (H2O) Magnesium hydroxide [Mg(OH)2] As  you  have  already  learnt  in Chapter 4, magnesium hydroxide is a base. So, magnesium oxide is a new substance formed  on  burning  of  magnesium. Magnesium  hydroxide  is  another  new  PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL CHANGES  49  Rationalised 2023-24substance formed by mixing magnesium oxide with water.  Activity  5.7  (To be demonstrated by the teacher) Dissolve about a teaspoonful of copper sulphate (blue vitriol or neela thotha) in about  half  a  cup  of  water  in  a  glass tumbler or a beaker. Add a few drops of dilute  sulphuric  acid  to  the  solution. You should get a blue coloured solution. Save a small sample of the solution in a test tube or a small glass bottle. Drop a nail  or  a  used  shaving  blade  into  the remaining  solution.  Wait  for  half  an hour  or  so.  Observe  the  colour  of  the solution. Compare it with the colour of the  sample  solution  saved  separately (Fig. 5.4).  colour  of  the  solution  from  blue  to green is due to the formation of iron sulphate, a new substance. The brown deposit  on  the  iron  nail  is  copper, another new substance. We can write the reaction as: Copper sulphate solution (blue) + Iron  Iron sulphate solution (green) + Copper (brown deposit)  Activity  5.8  Take about a teaspoonful of vinegar in a test tube. Add a pinch of baking soda to it. You would hear a hissing sound and  see  bubbles  of  a  gas  coming  out. Pass this gas through freshly prepared lime water as shown in Fig. 5.5.

Take out the nail or the blade. Has it changed in any way? The  changes  that  you  notice  are due  to  a  reaction  between  copper sulphate  and  iron.  The  change  of  follows:  Vinegar (Acetic acid) + Baking soda  (Sodium hydrogencarbonate)   Carbon dioxide + other substances The reaction between carbon dioxide  and lime water is as follows:  50  SCIENCE  Rationalised 2023-24Carbon dioxide  Vinegar + Baking soda  Lime water  Fig. 5.5  Set up to pass gas through lime water  Carbon  dioxide  (CO2)  +  Lime  water [Ca(OH) 2]   Calcium  Carbonate (CaCO3) + Water (H2O)  When  carbon  dioxide  is  passed through lime water, calcium carbonate is formed, which makes lime water milky. The turning of lime water into milky is a standard test of carbon dioxide. You will use it in Chapter 6 to show that the air we breathe out is rich in carbon dioxide. In  Activities  5.6–5.8,  you  saw  that in  each  change  one  or  more  new substances were formed. In Activity 5.6, the ash was the new substance formed when  magnesium  was  burnt  in  air.  In Activity  5.7,  the  reaction  of  copper sulphate  with  iron  produced  iron sulphate and copper.  Both of these are new substances. Copper was deposited on the shaving blade of iron. In Activity 5.8, vinegar and baking soda together produced carbon dioxide, which turned lime water milky. Can you name the new substance formed in this reaction?  A  change  in  which  one  or  more new substances are formed is called a chemical  change.  A  chemical  change is also called a chemical reaction.  Chemical changes are very important in  our  lives.    All  new  substances  are formed as a result of chemical changes. For  example,  digestion  of  food  in  our body, ripening of fruits, fermentation of grapes,  etc.,  happen  due  to  series  of chemical changes. A medicine is the end product of a chain of chemical reactions. Useful new materials, such as plastics and  detergents,  are  produced  by chemical  reactions.  Indeed,  every  new material  is  discovered  by  studying chemical changes.  We have seen that one or more new substances are produced in a chemical change.    In  addition  to  new  products, the following may accompany a chemical change:  Heat,  light  or  any  other  radiation (ultraviolet, for example) may be given off or absorbed.   Sound may be produced.   A change in smell may take place or  a new smell may be given off.   A colour change may take place .  A gas may be formed.  Let us look at some examples. You saw that burning of magnesium ribbon is a chemical change.  Burning of coal, wood or leaves is also a chemical change.  In  fact,  burning  of  any substance  is  a  chemical  change. Burning  is  always  accompanied  by production of heat.  PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL CHANGES  51  Rationalised 2023-24Explosion of a firework is a chemical change.  You  know  that  such  an explosion  produces  heat,  light,  sound and unpleasant gases that pollute the atmosphere. That is why you are advised not to play with fireworks.  When food gets spoiled, it produces a foul smell. Shall we call this change a chemical change?  You must have noticed that a slice of an apple acquires a brown colour if it is not consumed immediately. If you have not  seen  this  change  in  colour,  cut  a fresh slice of apple and keep it away for some time. Repeat the same activity with a slice of potato or brinjal. The change of  colour  in  these  cases  is  due  to  the formation  of  new  substances.  Are  not these changes chemical changes?  In Chapter 4, you neutralised an acid with a base.  Is neutralisation a chemical change?  A protective shield  You must have heard of the ozone layer in our atmosphere. It protects us from the harmful ultraviolet radiation which come from the sun. Ozone absorbs this radiation and breaks down to oxygen. Oxygen  is  different  from  ozone.  Can we call the breaking down of ozone a chemical change?  If  ultraviolet  radiation  were  not absorbed by ozone, it would reach the earth’s surface and cause harm to us and other life forms. Ozone acts as a natural shield against this radiation.  We learnt in Chapter 1 that plants produce their food by a process called photosynthesis. Can we call photosynthesis a chemical change?  Paheli said that even digestion is a chemical change.  5.3 RUSTING OF IRON  Let us get back to rusting. This is one change  that  affects  iron  articles  and slowly destroys them. Since iron is used in  making  bridges,  ships,  cars,  truck bodies  and  many  other  articles,  the monetary loss due to rusting is huge.  The  process  of  rusting  can  be represented by the following equation: Iron (Fe) + Oxygen (O2, from the air) + water (H2O) rust (iron oxide Fe2O3) For rusting, the presence of both oxygen  and  water  (or  water  vapour) is essential.  In fact, if the content of moisture in air  is  high,  which  means  if  it  is  more humid, rusting becomes faster.  So,  how  do  we  prevent  rusting? Prevent  iron  articles  from  coming  in contact with oxygen, or water, or both. One  simple  way  is  to  apply  a  coat  of paint  or  grease.  In  fact,  these  coats should be applied regularly to prevent rusting. Another way is to deposit a layer of a metal like chromium or zinc on iron.  52  SCIENCE  Rationalised 2023-24Oh, that is why my friend Rita is always complaining about iron articles rusting so  fast.  She lives near the coast.  This process of depositing a layer of zinc on iron is called galvanisation. The iron pipes we use in our homes to carry water are galvanised to prevent rusting.  You know that ships are made of iron and a part of them remains under water. On  the  part  above  water  also,  water drops keep clinging to the ship’s outer surface. Moreover, the water of the sea contains  many  salts.  The  salt  water makes  the  process  of  rust  formation faster.  Therefore,  ships  suffer  a  lot  of damage  from  rusting  in  spite  of  being  Stainless steel is made by mixing iron with  carbon  and  metals  like chromium, nickel and manganese.  It does not rust.  painted. So much so, that a fraction of ship’s iron has to be replaced every year. Can you imagine the monetary loss to the world?  5.4 CRYSTALLISATION In Class VI you have learnt that salt can be  obtained  by  the  evaporation  of  sea water. The  salt obtained in this manner is not pure and the shape of its crystals cannot be seen clearly. However, large crystals  of  pure  substances  can  be  formed from their solutions. The process is  called  crystallisation.    It  is  an example of a physical change.  Activity  5.9  (To be performed in the presence of the teacher)  CAUTION  Use  only  dilute  sulphuric  acid.  Be careful while boiling water.  Take  a  cupful  of  water  in  a  beaker and add a few drops of dilute sulphuric acid.    Heat  the  water.  When  it  starts boiling  add  copper  sulphate  powder slowly  while  stirring  continuously (Fig.  5.6).  Continue  adding  copper sulphate powder till no more powder can be dissolved. Filter the solution.  Allow it  to  cool.  Do  not  disturb  the  solution when it is cooling. Look at the solution after some time. Can you see the crystals of copper sulphate?  If not, wait for some more time.

5,5,0,"Respiration in Organisms  to  meet   6 O ne  day  Boojho  was  eagerly  his waiting  grandparents who were coming to the town after a year. He was in a real hurry as he wanted to receive them at the bus-stop.  He  ran  fast  and  reached  the bus-stop  in  a  few  minutes.  He  was breathing rapidly. His grandmother asked him why he was breathing so fast. Boojho told her that he came running all the way. But the question got stuck in his mind. He  wondered  why  running  makes  a person  breathe  faster.  The  answer  to Boojho’s question lies in understanding why  we  breathe.  Breathing  is  a  part  of respiration. Let us learn about respiration.  6.1 WHY DO WE RESPIRE?  In  Chapter  2  you  learnt  that  all organisms  are  made  of  small microscopic units called cells. A cell is the  smallest  structural  and  functional unit  of  an  organism.  Each  cell  of  an organism  performs  certain  functions such as nutrition, transport, excretion and  reproduction.  To  perform  these functions,  the  cell  needs  energy.  Even when we are eating, sleeping or reading we require energy. But, where does this energy  come  from?  Can  you  say  why your parents insist that you should eat regularly? The food has stored energy, which  is  released  during  respiration.  Therefore,  all  living  organisms  respire to  get  energy  from  food.  During breathing, we breathe in air. You know that air contains oxygen. We breathe out air which is rich in carbon dioxide. The air  we  breathe  in  is  transported  to  all parts of the body and ultimately to each cell. In  the cells, oxygen in the air helps in the breakdown of food. The process of breakdown of food in the cell with the release  of  energy  is  called  cellular respiration. Cellular respiration takes place in the cells of all organisms.  In the cell, the food (glucose) is broken down into carbon dioxide and water using oxygen.  When  breakdown  of  glucose occurs with the use of oxygen it is called aerobic  respiration.  Food  can  also  be broken down, without using oxygen. This is  called  anaerobic  respiration. Breakdown of food releases energy.  You should know that there are some organisms such as yeast that can survive in  the  absence  of  air.  They  are  called anaerobes.  They  get  energy  through anaerobic respiration. In the absence of oxygen, glucose breaks down into alcohol and carbon dioxide, as given below:  Rationalised 2023-24Yeasts  are  single-celled  organisms. They respire anaerobically and during this  process  yield  alcohol.  They  are, therefore, used to make wine and beer.  Our  muscle  cells  can  also  respire anaerobically, but only for a short time, when there is a temporary deficiency of oxygen.  During  heavy  exercise,  fast running (Fig. 6.1), cycling, walking for many hours or heavy weight lifting, the demand  for  energy  is  high.  But  the supply of oxygen to produce the energy is  limited.  Then  anaerobic  respiration takes places in the muscle cells to fulfil the demand of energy:  Fig. 6.1  During exercise, some muscles may respire anaerobically  Have you ever wondered why you get muscle cramps after heavy exercise? The cramps occur when muscle cells respire anaerobically. The partial breakdown of glucose  produces  lactic  acid.  The accumulation of lactic acid causes muscle cramps. We get relief from cramps after a hot water bath or a massage. Can you guess  why  it  is  so?  Hot  water  bath  or massage improves circulation of blood. As a result, the supply of oxygen to the muscle cells increases. The increase in the  supply  of  oxygen  results  in  the complete  breakdown  of  lactic  acid  into carbon dioxide and water.  6.2 BREATHING  Activity  6.1  CAUTION  Do this activity under the supervision of your teacher.  Close  your  nostrils  and  mouth tightly  and  look  at  a  watch.  What  did you feel after some time? How long were you able to keep both of them closed? Note down the time for which you could hold your breath (Fig. 6.2).  So, now you know that you cannot  survive for long without breathing.   Breathing means taking in air rich in  oxygen  and  giving  out  air  rich  in carbon  dioxide  with  the  help  of respiratory organs. The taking in of air rich  in  oxygen into  the  body  is  called inhalation and giving out of air rich in carbon dioxide is known as exhalation. It  is  a  continuous  process  which  goes  58  SCIENCE  Rationalised 2023-24on all the time and throughout the life of an organism.  The  number  of  times  a  person breathes in a minute is termed as the breathing  rate.  During  breathing inhalation  and  exhalation  take  place alternately.  A  breath  means  one inhalation plus one exhalation. Would  Fig. 6.2   Holding breath  Boojho noticed that when he released his breath after holding it for some time, he had to breathe heavily. Can you tell him why it was so?  you like to find out your breathing rate? Do  you  want  to  know  whether  it  is constant or it changes according to the requirement of oxygen by the body? Let us  find  out  by  doing  the  following activity.  Activity  6.2  Generally we are not aware that we are breathing. However, if you try you can count  your  rate  of  breathing.  Breathe in and out normally. Find out how many times  you  breathe  in  and  breathe  out in a minute? Did you inhale the same number of times as you exhaled? Now count  your  breathing  rate  (number  of breaths/minute)  after  brisk  walk  and after  running.  Record  your  breathing rate as soon as you finish and also after complete  rest.  Tabulate  your  findings and compare your breathing rates under different conditions with those of your classmates.  From the above activity, you must have realised that whenever a person needs extra energy, he/she breathes faster.  As  a  result  more  oxygen  is  Table 6.1 Changes in breathing rate under different conditions  Name  of  the  classmate  Breathing  rate  Normal  After  a  brisk walk for 10 minutes  After  running fast 100 m  At  rest  Self  RESPIRATION IN ORGANISMS  59  Rationalised 2023-24On an average, an adult human being at  rest  breathes  in  and  out  15 –18 times  in  a  minute.

While  we  exercise,  not  only  do  we breathe fast, we also take deep breaths and thus inhale more oxygen.  supplied  to  our  cells.  It  speeds  up the  breakdown  of  food  and  more energy is released. Does this explain w h y   do  w e   f e e l   h u n g r y   a f t e r   a physical activity?

Can you say in which activity, the rate of breathing will be the slowest and in  which  it  will  be  the  fastest?  Assign numbers to the pictures in the order of increasing  rate  of  breathing  according to your experience.  6.3 HOW DO WE BREATHE? Let us now learn about the mechanism of  breathing.  Normally  we  take  in  air through  our  nostrils.  When  we  inhale air, it passes through our nostrils into the nasal cavity. From the nasal cavity, the air reaches our lungs through the windpipe.  Lungs  are  present  in  the chest  cavity  (Fig.  6.4).  This  cavity  is surrounded by ribs on the sides. A large, muscular sheet called diaphragm forms the  floor  of  the  chest  cavity  (Fig.  6.4). Breathing involves the movement of the diaphragm and the rib cage.  During inhalation, ribs move up and outwards and diaphragm moves down. This movement increases space in our chest  cavity  and  air  rushes  into  the lungs.  The  lungs  get  filled  with  air. During exhalation, ribs move down and inwards, while diaphragm moves up to its former position. This reduces the size of the chest cavity and air is pushed out of the lungs (Fig. 6.5). These movements in  our  body  can  be  felt  easily.  Take  a  60  SCIENCE  Rationalised 2023-24deep  breath.  Keep  your  palm  on  the abdomen,  feel  the  movement  of abdomen. What do you find?  After  having  learnt  that  during breathing there are changes in the size of the chest cavity, children got involved in  the  chest  expansion  competition.

How about  doing  this  activity  in  the  class with your classmates?  Pharynx  Trachea  Lungs  Ribs  Nasal passage  Oral cavity  Diaphragm  Fig 6.4 Human respiratory system  The air around us has various types of unwanted particles, such as smoke, dust, pollens, etc. When we inhale, the particles get trapped in the hair present in our nasal cavity. However, sometimes these particles may get past the hair in the nasal cavity. This may irritate the lining of the cavity, as a result of which we sneeze. Sneezing expels these foreign particles from the inhaled air and a dust- free, clean air enters our body. TAKE CARE: When you sneeze, you should cover your nose so that the foreign particles you expel are not inhaled by other persons.  RESPIRATION IN ORGANISMS  61  Rationalised 2023-24Activity  6.4  Activity  6.5  Take  a  deep  breath.  Measure  the  size of  the  chest  with  a  measuring  tape (Fig. 6.6) and record your observations in  Table  6.2.  Measure  the  size  of  the chest  again  when  expanded  and indicate  which  classmate  shows  the maximum expansion of the chest.  We can understand the mechanism  of breathing by a simple model.  Take a wide plastic bottle. Remove the bottom. Get a Y-shaped glass or plastic tube. Make a hole in the lid so that the tube may pass through it. To the forked end of the tube fix two deflated balloons. Introduce  the  tube  into  the  bottle  as shown in Fig. 6.7. Now cap the bottle. Seal it to make it airtight.

Now  blow  gently through the straw a few times (Fig. 6.8). Is there a change in the appearance of lime water? Can you explain this change on  the  basis  of  what  you  learnt  in Chapter 5?  You are aware that air we inhale or exhale  is  a  mixture  of  gases.  What  do we  exhale?  Do  we  exhale  only  carbon dioxide or a mixture of gases along with it? You must have also observed that if you  exhale  on  a  mirror,  a  film  of moisture appears on its surface. From where do these droplets come?  Boojho wants to know how much air a person can hold in the lungs.

Next, push the rubber/plastic sheet up and observe the balloons. Did you see any changes in the balloons?  What do the balloons in this model represent? What does the rubber sheet represent?  Now, you should be able to explain  the mechanism of breathing.  6.4 WHAT DO WE BREATHE OUT ?  Activity  6.6  Take  a  slender,  clean  test  tube  or  a glass/plastic bottle. Make a hole in its lid and fix it on the bottle.  Pour some freshly  prepared  lime  water  in  the test-tube.

Thus more oxygen can be supplied to the body cells resulting in release of more energy.

How do other organisms breathe? Do they also have lungs like those of human beings? Let us find out. Cockroach:  A  cockroach  has  small openings on the sides of its body. Other insects  also  have  similar  openings.  Boojho wants to know if cockroaches, snails, fish, earthworms, ants and mosquitoes also have lungs.  These  openings  are  called  spiracles (Fig. 6.9). Insects have a network of air tubes called tracheae for gas exchange. Oxygen rich air rushes through spiracles into the tracheal tubes, diffuses into the body  tissue,  and  reaches  every  cell  of the body. Similarly, carbon dioxide from the cells goes into the tracheal tubes and moves out through spiracles. These air tubes  or  tracheae  are  found  only  in insects  and  not  in  any  other  group  of animals.  Tracheae  Fig.6.9  Tracheal system  Earthworm:  Recall from Chapter 6 of Class  VI  that  earthworms  breathe through  their  skins.  The  skin  of  an earthworm  feels  moist  and  slimy  on touching. Gases can easily pass through them. Though frogs have a pair of lungs like  human  beings,  they  can  also breathe  through  their  skin,  which  is moist and slippery.  64  SCIENCE  Rationalised 2023-24Boojho has seen in television programmes that whales and dolphins often come up to the water surface. They even release a fountain of water sometimes while moving upwards. Why do they do so?  6.6 BREATHING UNDER WATER Can  we  breathe  and  survive  in  water? There are many organisms which live in water. How do they breathe under water? You  have  studied  in  Class  VI  that gills  in  fish  help  them  to  use  oxygen dissolved in water. Gills are projections of the skin. You may wonder how gills help in breathing. Gills are well supplied with  blood  vessels  (Fig.  6.10)  for exchange of gases.  Gills  Fig. 6.10  Breathing organs in fish  6.7 DO PLANTS ALSO RESPIRE? Like other living organisms, plants also respire  for  their  survival  as  you  have learnt  in  Class  VI.  They  also  take  in oxygen from the air and give out carbon  dioxide.  In  the  cells  oxygen  is  used  to break down glucose into carbon dioxide and  water  as  in  other  organisms.  In plants each part can independently take in  oxygen  from  the  air  and  give  out carbon dioxide. You have already learnt in Chapter 1 that the leaves of the plants have  tiny  pores  called  stomata  for exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide.  Paheli wants to know whether roots, which are underground also take in oxygen? If so, how?  Like  all  other  living  cells  of  the plants,  the  root  cells  also  need oxygen  to  generate  energy.  Roots  take up  air  from  the  air  spaces  present between  the  soil  particles  (Fig.  6.11).

In   learnt this  chapter  you  that  respiration  is  a  vital  biological  process.  All  living  organisms  need to  respire  to  get  the  energy  needed for their survival.  Keywords  Aerobic respiration  Anaerobic respiration  Diaphragm  Exhalation  Breathing rate  Cellular respiration  Gills  Lungs  What you have learnt  Inhalation  Spiracles  Tracheae  Ribs   Respiration is essential for survival of living organisms. It releases energy  from the food.   The oxygen we inhale is used to breakdown glucose into carbon dioxide  and water. Energy is released in the process.   The breakdown of glucose occurs in the cells of an organism (cellular  respiration).    If the food is broken down with the use of oxygen, it is called aerobic respiration.  If  the  breakdown  occurs  without  the  use  of  oxygen,  the respiration is called anaerobic respiration.   During heavy exercise when the supply of oxygen to our muscle cells is  insufficient, food breakdown is by anaerobic respiration.   Breathing  is  a  part  of  the  process  of  respiration  during  which  an organism takes in the oxygen-rich air and gives out air rich in carbon dioxide. The respiratory organs for the exchange of gases vary in different organisms.   During inhalation, our lungs expand and then come back to the original  state as the air moves out during exhalation.          Increased physical activity enhances the rate of breathing.  In animals like cow, buffalo, dog and cat the respiratory organs and the process of breathing are similar to those in humans.  In earthworm, the exchange of gases occurs through the moist skin. In fishes it takes place through gills and in insects through the tracheae.  In a plant the roots take in air present in the soil. Leaves have tiny pores called stomata through which they exchange gases. The breakdown of glucose in the plant cells is similar to that in other living beings.  66  SCIENCE  Rationalised 2023-24Exercises  1.

You will find flap like structures on both sides of their heads. These are flaps which cover the gills. These flaps open and close alternately. On the basis of these observations, explain the process of respiration in the fish.  2. Visit a local doctor. Learn about the harmful effects of smoking. You can also collect material on this topic from other sources. You can seek help of your teacher or parents. Find out the percentage of people of your area who smoke. If you have a smoker in your family, confront him with the material that you have collected.  3. Visit a doctor. Find out about artificial respiration. Ask the doctor:  (a) When does a person need artificial respiration?  (b) Does the person need to be kept on artificial respiration temporarily  or permanently?  (c) From where can the person get supply of oxygen for artificial  respiration?  4. Measure the breathing rate of the members of your family and some of  your friends.

If there is a difference in any of these cases, try to find the reason.  Did you know?  For us oxygen is essential, but for those organisms which do not use it, oxygen  is  toxic.  In  fact,  for  humans  and  other  organisms  it  may  be dangerous to breathe pure oxygen for long.  RESPIRATION IN ORGANISMS  69  Rationalised 2023-24"
6,6,0,"Transportation in Animals  and  Plants  7 You  have  learnt  earlier  that  all  organisms need food, water and oxygen for survival. They need to transport  all  these  to  various  parts  of their  body.  Further,  animals  need  to transport  wastes  to  parts  from  where they  can  be  removed.  Have  you wondered how all this is achieved? Look at  Fig.  7.1.  Do  you  see  the  heart  and the  blood  vessels?  They  function  to transport substances and together form the circulatory system. In this chapter, you  shall  learn  about  transport  of substances in animals and plants.  Heart  Vein  Artery  7.1 CIRCULATORY SYSTEM  Blood What  happens  when  you  get  a  cut  on your  body?  Blood  flows  out.  But  what is  blood?  Blood  is  the  fluid  which flows  in  blood  vessels.  It  transports substances like digested food from the small intestine to the other parts of the body. It carries oxygen from the lungs to the cells of the body. It also transports waste for removal from the body.  How  does  the  blood  carry  various substances?  Blood  is  composed  of  a fluid,  called  plasma  in  which  different types of cells are suspended.  Why is the colour of blood red ?  Fig. 7.1  Circulatory system  (Arteries are shown in red colour and veins in blue)  Rationalised 2023-24One type of cells are the red blood cells (RBC) which contain a red pigment called  haemoglobin.  Haemoglobin binds with oxygen and transports it to all the parts of the body and ultimately to  all  the  cells.  It  will  be  difficult  to provide oxygen efficiently to all the cells of  the  body  without  haemoglobin.  The presence  of  haemoglobin  makes  blood appear red.  The blood also has white blood cells (WBC)  which  fight  against  germs  that may enter our body.  Boojho  fell  down  while  playing  a game  and  his  knee  got  injured.  Blood was coming out from the cut. After some time,  he  noticed  that  bleeding  had stopped and a dark red clot had plugged the cut. Boojho was puzzled about this. The  clot  is  formed  because  of  the presence of another type of cells in the blood, called platelets.  Blood vessels  There are different types of blood vessels in  the  body.  You  know  that  during inhalation a fresh supply of oxygen fills the lungs. Oxygen has to be transported to the rest of the body.  Also,  the  blood  picks  up  the  waste materials including carbon dioxide from the cells. This blood has to go back to the heart for transport to the lungs for removal of carbon dioxide as you have learnt  in  Chapter  6.  So,  two  types  of blood vessels,   arteries and veins are present in the body. (Fig. 7.1)  Arteries  carry  oxygen-rich  blood from the heart to all parts of the body.  Since  the  blood  flow  is  rapid  and  at  a high  pressure,  the  arteries  have  thick elastic walls.  Let us perform an activity to study  the flow of blood through arteries.  Activity  7.1  Place  the  middle  and  index  finger  of your right hand on the inner side of your left wrist (Fig. 7.2). Can you feel some throbbing  movements?  Why  do  you think  there  is  throbbing?  This throbbing is called the pulse and it is due to the blood flowing in the arteries. Count the number of pulse beats in one minute.  How  many  pulse  beats  could  you count? The number of beats per minute is  called  the  pulse  rate.  A  resting person, usually has a pulse rate between 72 and 80 beats per minute. Find other places in your body where you can feel the pulse.  Record  your  own  pulse  beats  per minute  and  those  of  your  classmates. Insert  the  values  you  obtained  in Table 7.1 and compare them.

Veins  are  the  vessels  which  carry carbon dioxide-rich blood from all parts of the body back to the heart. The veins have thin walls. There are valves present in veins which allow blood to flow only towards the heart.  Lungs  Pulmonary artery  Pulmonary vein  Heart  Vein  Artery  Capillaries  Fig. 7.3  Schematic diagram of circulation  Blood Donation Hundreds  of  people  die  due  to unavailability  of  blood.  Voluntary blood  donation  is  harmless  and painless and can save precious lives. Blood can be donated at hospitals and other  places  authorised  by  the government. Donated blood are stored with special care in Blood Banks.  I am confused! I have learnt that an artery always carries oxygen-rich blood.   Paheli explained that the pulmonary artery carries blood from the heart, so it is called an artery and not a vein. It carries carbon dioxide-rich blood to the lungs. Pulmonary vein carries oxygen-rich blood from the lungs to the heart.   Refer  to  Fig.  7.3.  Do  you  see  the arteries divide into smaller vessels? On reaching the tissues, they divide further into  extremely  thin  tubes  called capillaries. The capillaries join to form veins which empty into the heart.  Heart  The  heart  is  an  organ  which  beats continuously to act as a pump for the transport of blood, which carries other substances with it.  Imagine  a  pump  working  for years  without  stopping!  Absolutely impossible. Yet our heart works like a pump non-stop. Let us now learn about the heart.  The  heart  is  located  in  the  chest cavity  with  its  lower  tip  slightly  tilted towards  the  left  (Fig.  7.1).  Hold  your fingers  inwards  on  your  palm.  That  72  SCIENCE  Rationalised 2023-24makes your fist. Your heart is roughly the size of your fist.  What will happen if the blood rich in oxygen  and  the  blood  rich  in  carbon dioxide mix with each other? To avoid this from happening, the heart has four  chambers. The two upper chambers are called the atria (singular: atrium) and the two lower chambers are called the ventricles  (Fig.  7.4).  The  partition between the chambers  helps to avoid  Vena Cava  Aorta  Right atrium  Partition completely separating the two halves  Right ventricle  Pulmonary artery  Pulmonary vein  Left atrium  Left ventricle  Fig. 7.4  Sections of human heart  Paheli wonders which side of the heart will have oxygen-rich blood and which side will have carbon dioxide-rich blood.  mixing up of blood rich in oxygen with the blood rich in carbon dioxide.

Activity  7.2  Take  a  small  funnel  of  6 –7  cm  in diameter. Fix a rubber tube (50 cm long) tightly on the stem of the funnel. Stretch a  rubber  sheet  (or  a  balloon)  on  the mouth  of  the  funnel  and  fix  it  tightly with a rubber band. Put the open end of the tube on one of your ears. Place  to the lungs and back to the heart from where  it  is  pumped  to  the  rest  of  the body.  Heartbeat The walls of the chambers of the heart are made up of muscles. These muscles contract  and  relax  rhythmically.  This rhythmic  contraction  followed  by  its relaxation  constitute  a  heartbeat. Remember  that  heartbeats  continue every  moment  of  our  life.  If  you  place your hand on the left side of your chest, you can feel your heartbeat. The doctor feels  your  heartbeats  with  the  help  of an instrument called a stethoscope.  A doctor uses the stethoscope as a device to amplify the sound of the heart. It consists of a chest piece that carries a sensitive diaphragm, two ear pieces and a  tube  joining  the  parts.

Now  try  to  listen carefully.  Do  you  hear  a  regular thumping sound ? The sound is that of heart beats. How many times did your heart  beat  in  a  minute  ?  Count  again after running for 4–5 minutes. Compare your observations.  Record your own pulse rate and heart beat  and  that  of  your  friends  while resting and after running and record in Table 7.2. Do you find any relationship between your heart beat and pulse rate? Each heart beat generates one pulse in the  arteries  and  the  pulse  rate  per minute indicates the rate of heart beat. The rhythmic beating of the various chambers  of  the  heart  maintain circulation  of  blood  and  transport  of substances to the different parts of the body.  Boojho  wonders  if  sponges  and hydra  also  have  blood?  Animals  such as  sponges  and  Hydra  do  not  possess any  circulatory  system.  The  water  in which they live brings food and oxygen  The English physician, William Harvey (A.D.1578 –1657),  discovered  the circulation  of  blood.  The  current opinion in those days was that blood oscillates  in  the  vessels  of  the  body. For  his  views,  Harvey  was  ridiculed and  was  called  “circulator”.  He  lost most of his patients. However, before he  died,  Harvey’s  idea  about circulation was generally accepted as a biological fact.  as  it  enters  their  bodies.  The  water carries away waste materials and carbon dioxide  as  it  moves  out.  Thus,  these animals do not need a circulatory fluid like the blood.  Let us now learn about the removal  of waste other than carbon dioxide.  7.2 EXCRETION IN ANIMALS  Recall  how  carbon  dioxide  is  removed as  waste  from  the  body  through  the lungs during exhalation. Also recall that the undigested food is removed during egestion. Let us now find out how the other waste materials are removed from the body. You may wonder where these unwanted materials come from!  When  our  cells  perform  their functions,  certain  waste  products  are released. These are toxic and hence need to  be  removed  from  the  body.  The process of removal of wastes produced in  the  cells  of  the  living  organisms  is called excretion. The parts involved in excretion form the excretory system.  Excretory  system  in  humans  The waste which is present in the blood has to be removed from the body. How can this be done? A mechanism to filter the  blood  is  required.  This  is  done  by the  blood  capillaries  in  the  kidneys. When the blood reaches the two kidneys, it  contains  both  useful  and  harmful substances. The useful substances are absorbed  back  into  the  blood.  The wastes dissolved in water are removed as  urine. From the kidneys, the urine goes into the urinary bladder through  TRANSPORTATION IN ANIMALS AND PLANTS  75  Rationalised 2023-24Kidney  Ureter  Urinary bladder  Urethra  Urinary opening  Fig. 7.6  Human excretory system  tube-like  ureters.  It  is  stored  in  the bladder and is passed out through the urinary  opening  at  the  end  of  a muscular tube called urethra (Fig. 7.6). The  kindeys,  ureters,  bladder  and urethra form the excretory system.  An  adult  human  being  normally passes  about  1–1.8  L  of  urine  in  24 hours. The urine consists of 95% water, 2.5%  urea  and  2.5%  other  waste products.  We have all experienced that we sweat on  a  hot  summer  day.  The  sweat  contains  water  and  salts.  Boojho  has seen that sometimes in summer, white patches  are  formed  on  our  clothes, especially  in  areas  like  underarms. These marks are left by salts present in the sweat.  Does sweat serve any other function? We  know  that  the  water  kept  in  an earthen  pot  (matka)  is  cooler.  This  is because the water evaporates from the pores of the pot, which causes cooling.  Paheli wants to know whether other animals also urinate?  The  way  in  which  waste  chemicals are  removed  from  the  body  of  the animal  depends  on  the  availability of water. Aquatic animals like fishes, excrete cell waste as ammonia which directly  dissolves  in  water.  Some land  animals  like  birds,  lizards, snakes  excrete  a  semi-solid,  white coloured compound (uric acid). The major excretory product in humans is urea.  Sometimes  a  person’s  kidneys  may stop  working  due  to  infection  or injury. As a result of kidney failure, waste products start accumulating in the  blood.  Such  persons  cannot survive unless their blood is filtered periodically  through  an  artificial kidney. This process is called dialysis.  76  SCIENCE  Rationalised 2023-24The root hair increase the surface area of  the  root  for  the  absorption  of  water and  mineral  nutrients  dissolved  in water. The root hair is in contact with the  water  present  between  the  soil particles [Fig. 7.7 (a)].  Can  you  guess  how  water  moves from the root to the leaves? What kind of transport system is present in plants?  Boojho thinks that plants may have pipes to transport water to the entire plant like we have in our homes for the supply of water.  Similarly, when we sweat, it helps to cool our body.  7.3 TRANSPORT OF SUBSTANCES IN  PLANTS  In Chapter 1 you learnt that plants take water and mineral nutrients from the soil through the roots and transport it to the leaves.  The  leaves  prepare  food  for  the plant,  using  water  and  carbon  dioxide during photosynthesis. You also learnt in Chapter 6 that food is the source of energy and every cell of an organism gets energy by  the  breakdown  of  glucose.  The  cells use this energy to carry out vital activities of  life.  Therefore  food  must  be  made available to every cell of an organism. Have you ever wondered how water and nutrients  absorbed  by  the  root  are transported to the leaves? How is the food prepared by the leaves carried to the parts which cannot make food?  Transport of water and minerals Plants absorb water and minerals by the  roots.  The  roots  have  root  hair.  Root hair  (b)  (a)  Xylem vessels  Fig. 7.7  Transport of water and minerals in (a) a section of root, (b) a tree  TRANSPORTATION IN ANIMALS AND PLANTS  77  Rationalised 2023-24Well,  Boojho  is  right.  Plants  have pipe-like vessels to transport water and nutrients from the soil. The vessels are made  of  special  cells,  forming  the vascular tissue. A tissue is a group of cells that perform specialised function in an organism. The vascular tissue for the transport of water and nutrients in the plant is called the xylem [Fig. 7.7 (a)]. The  xylem  forms  a  continuous network of channels that connects roots to  the  leaves  through  the  stem  and branches and thus transports water to the entire plant [Fig. 7.7 (b)].  Paheli says her mother puts ladyfinger and other vegetables in water if they are somewhat dry. She wants to know how water enters into them.  You  know  that  leaves  synthesise food. The food has to be transported to all  parts  of  the  plant.  This  is  done  by the vascular tissue called the phloem. Thus,  xylem  and  phloem  transport substances in plants.  Activity  7.3  We would require a glass tumbler, water, red  ink,  a  tender  herb  (e.g.,  Balsam), and a blade for this activity.  Pour  water  to  fill  one-third  of  the tumbler. Add a few drops of red ink to the water. Cut the base of the stem of the herb and place it in the glass as shown in Fig. 7.8(a). Observe it the next day.  Fig. 7.8 (a) Stem placed in coloured water  (b)  (c)  Fig. 7.8 (b) Water moves up in the stem (c) Enlarged view of open end of stem  Does  any  part  of  the  herb  appear red? If yes, how do you think the colour reached there?  You can cut the stem across and look for  the  red  colour  inside  the  stem (Fig. 7.8(b) and 7.8(c)).  From this activity we see that water moves up the stem. In other words, stem conducts  water.  Just  like  the  red  ink, minerals dissolved in water also move up  the  stem,  along  with  water.  Water and  minerals  go  to  leaves  and  other plant  parts,  through  narrow  tubes (xylem) inside the stem (Fig. 7.7(b)).  Boojho wants to know why plants absorb a large quantity of water from the soil, then give it off by transpiration!  78  SCIENCE  Rationalised 2023-24Transpiration In  Class  VI  you  learnt  that  plants release a lot of water by the process of transpiration.   Plants absorb mineral nutrients and water  from  the  soil.  Not  all  the  water absorbed is utilised by the plant. The water evaporates through the stomata present  on the surface of the leaves by the process of transpiration. The evaporation of water from leaves generates a suction pull (the same that you produce when you suck water  through  a  straw)  which  can pull  water  to  great  heights  in  the tall  trees.  Transpiration  also  cools the plant.

It also carries waste products from different parts of the body for excretion.   Circulatory system consists of the heart and blood vessels.    In humans, blood flows through arteries and veins and the heart acts as a pumping organ.   Blood consists of plasma, RBC, WBC and platelets. Blood is red due to  the presence of a red pigment, haemoglobin.   The  human  heart  beats  about  70–80  times  per  minute  in  an  adult  person. This is called heart rate.   Arteries carry blood from the heart to all parts of the body.   Veins carry blood from all parts of the body back to the heart.   Removal of waste products from the body is called excretion.

7,7,0,"Reproduction in Plants  8 T o  produce   its  kind   is  a characteristic  of  all  living organisms.  You  have  already learnt this in Class VI. The production of new individuals from their parents is known  as  reproduction.  But,  how  do plants  reproduce?  There  are  different modes of reproduction in plants which we shall learn in this chapter.  8.1 MODES OF REPRODUCTION In  Class  VI  you  learnt  about  different parts of a flowering plant. Try to list the various  parts  of  a  plant  and  write  the functions  of  each.  Most  plants  have roots, stems and leaves. These are called the vegetative parts of a plant. After a certain  period  of  growth,  most  plants bear  flowers.  You  may  have  seen  the mango  trees  flowering  in  spring.  It  is these  flowers  that  give  rise  to  juicy mango fruit we enjoy in summer. We eat the fruits and usually discard the seeds. Seeds germinate and form new plants. So,  what  is  the  function  of  flowers  in plants? Flowers perform the function of reproduction in plants. Flowers are the reproductive parts.  There  are  several  ways  by  which plants produce their offspring. These are categorised into two types: (i) asexual, and (ii) sexual reproduction. In asexual reproduction plants can give rise to new plants without seeds, whereas in sexual  reproduction, new plants are obtained from seeds.  Paheli thought that new plants always grow from seeds. But, she has never seen the seeds of sugarcane, potato and rose. She wants to know how these plants reproduce.  Asexual  reproduction  In asexual reproduction new plants are obtained without production of seeds.  Vegetative  propagation It  is  a  type  of  asexual  reproduction  in which  new  plants  are  produced  from roots,  stems,  leaves  and  buds.  Since reproduction is through the vegetative parts  of  the  plant,  it  is  known  as vegetative propagation.  Activity  8.1  Cut a branch of rose or champa with a node. This piece of branch is termed a cutting. Bury the cutting in the soil. A node  is  a  part  of  the  stem/branch  at which a leaf arises (Fig. 8.1). Water the cutting  every  day  and  observe  its growth. Observe and record the number of days taken for roots to come out and  Rationalised 2023-24new leaves to arise. Try the same activity by growing money plant in a jar of water and record your observations.  Node  Bud in the axil  Fig. 8.1  Stem-cutting of rose  You  must  have  seen  flower  buds developing  into  flowers.  Apart  from flower buds, there are buds in the axil (point  of  attachment  of  the  leaf  at  the node)  of  leaves  which  develop  into shoots. These buds are called vegetative buds (Fig. 8.2). A bud consists of a short immature stem  around  which  overlapping leaves are present. Vegetative buds can also give rise to new plants.  Activity  8.2  Take a fresh potato. Observe the scars on it with the help of a magnifying glass. You may find bud(s) in them. These scars are also called “eyes”. Cut the potato into  small  portions,  each  with  an  eye and  bury  them  in  the  soil.  Water  the pieces  regularly  for  a  few  days  and observe their progress. What do you find?  Fig. 8.2  Potato plant sprouting from an ‘eye’  Likewise  you  can  also  grow  ginger  (Fig. 8.3) or turmeric.  Bryophyllum (sprout leaf plant) has buds in the margins of leaves (Fig. 8.4). If  a  leaf  of  this  plant  falls  on  a  moist  Fig. 8.3  Ginger with new plants sprouting from it  soil,  each  bud  can  give  rise  to  a  new plant.  Roots  of  some  plants  can  also  give rise  to  new  plants.  Sweet  potato  and dahlia are examples.  Plants  such  as  cacti  produce  new plants  when  their  parts  get  detached  REPRODUCTION IN PLANTS  83  Rationalised 2023-24New plants  Fig. 8.4  Leaf of Bryophyllum with buds in the margin  from  the  main  plant  body.  Each detached  part  can  grow  into  a  new plant.  Boojho wants to know if there is any advantage of vegetative propagation.  Plants  produced  by  vegetative propagation take less time to grow and bear flowers and fruits earlier than those produced  from  seeds.  The  new  plants are exact copies of the parent plant, as they are produced from a single parent. Later in this chapter you will learn that  plants  produced  by  sexual reproduction have characters of both the parents. Plants produce seeds as a result of sexual reproduction.  Budding You have already learnt about the tiny organisms like yeast can be seen only under  a  microscope.  These  grow  and multiply  every  few  hours  if  sufficient nutrients  are  made  available  to  them. Remember that yeast is a single-celled organism.  Let  us  see  how  they reproduce?  Activity  8.3  (To be demonstrated by the teacher) Take  a  piece  of  yeast  cake  or  yeast powder  from a bakery or a chemist shop. Take a pinch of yeast and place it in a container  with  some  water.  Add  a spoonful of sugar and shake to dissolve it. Keep it in the warm part of a room. After an hour, put a drop of this liquid on  a  glass  slide  and  observe  under  a microscope. What do you observe? You may see the formation of new yeast cells (Fig. 8.5).  Developing bud  Chain of buds  New bud  Yeast cell  Fig. 8.5  Reproduction in yeast by budding  The  small  bulb-like  projection coming out from the yeast cell is called a  bud.  The  bud  gradually  grows  and gets detached from the parent cell and forms a new yeast cell. The new yeast cell grows, matures and produces more yeast  cells.  Sometimes,  another    bud arises from the bud forming a chain of buds. If this process continues, a large number of yeast cells are produced in a short time.  Fragmentation  You  might  have  seen  slimy  green patches in ponds, or in other stagnant water bodies. These are the algae. When  84  SCIENCE  Rationalised 2023-24water and nutrients are available algae grow  and  multiply  rapidly  by fragmentation. An alga breaks up into two or more fragments. These fragments or  pieces  grow  into  new  individuals (Fig.  8.6).  This  process  continues  and they cover a large area in a short period of time.  Fig. 8.6  Fragmentation in spirogyra (an alga)  Spore  formation  In Chapter 1 you learnt that the fungi on a bread piece grow from spores which are  present  in  the  air.  Repeat  Activity 1.2. Observe the spores in the cotton- like  mesh  on  the  bread.  When  spores are  released  they  keep  floating  in  the  Sporangium  Spores  Hypha  Fig. 8.7  Reproduction through spore formation in fungus  Sori (Spore forming bodies)  Fig. 8.8  Reproduction through spore formation in fern  air. As they are very light they can cover long distances.  Spores  are  asexual  reproductive bodies.  Each  spore  is  covered  by  a hard  protective  coat  to  withstand unfavourable  conditions  such  as  high temperature  and  low  humidity.  So they can survive for a long time. Under favourable  conditions,  a  spore germinates  and  develops  into  a  new individual.  Plants  such  as  moss  and ferns (Fig. 8.8) also reproduce by means of spores.  12.2 SEXUAL REPRODUCTION  You have learnt earlier the structure of a flower. You know that the flowers are the  reproductive  parts  of  a  plant. Stamens are the male reproductive part and pistil is the female reproductive part (Fig. 8.9).  REPRODUCTION IN PLANTS  85  Rationalised 2023-24Activity  8.4  Take  a  mustard/China  rose/petunia flower  and  separate  its  reproductive parts.  Study  the  various  parts  of  a stamen and pistil.  Flowers  which  contain  either  only pistil  or  only  stamens  are  called unisexual  flowers.  Flowers  which contain  both  stamens  and  pistil  are called bisexual flowers. Corn, papaya and  cucumber  produce  unisexual flowers,  whereas  mustard,  rose  and petunia  have  bisexual  flowers.  Both  male and female unisexual flowers may be  present  in  the  same  plant  or  in different plants.  Could  you  identify  the  anther  and the filament of a stamen? [Fig. 8.9 (a)]. Anther  contains  pollen  grains  which produce male gametes. A pistil consists of  stigma,  style  and  ovary.  Ovary contains  one  or  more  ovules.  The female gamete or the egg is formed in an  ovule  [Fig.  8.9  (b)].  In  sexual reproduction  a  male  and  a  female gamete fuse to form a zygote.  Anther  Filament  Boojho wants to know how the male gamete in the pollen grain reaches the female gamete present in the ovule.  Pollination Generally,  pollen  grains  have  a  tough protective  coat  which  prevents  them from drying up. Since pollen grains are light,  they  can  be  carried  by  wind  or  Stigma  Pollens  Anther  Stigma  (a) Self-pollination  (b)  Cross-pollination  (a) Stamen  Stigma  Style  Ovary  Ovule  (b) Pistil  Fig. 8.9  Reproductive parts  Fig. 8.10 Pollination in flower  86  SCIENCE  Rationalised 2023-24Boojho wants to know why flowers are generally so colourful and fragrant. Is it to attract insects?  water.  Insects  visit  flowers  and  carry away  pollen  on  their  bodies.  Some  of the pollen lands on the stigma of a flower of the same kind. The transfer of pollen from the anther to the stigma of a flower is called pollination.  If the pollen lands on  the  stigma  of  the  same  flower  or another flower of the same plant, it is called self-pollination. When the pollen of a flower lands on the stigma of a flower of a different plant of the same kind, it is called cross-pollination [Fig. 8.10 (a) and (b)].  Pollen grain (germinating)  Pollen tube  Zygote formation  Ovum  (a)  (b)  Fig. 8.11  Fertilisation (Zygote formation)  Fertilisation The  cell  which  results  after  fusion  of the  gametes  is  called  a  zygote.  The process  of  fusion  of  male  and  female  (a)  (b)  Fig. 8.12  (a) Section of an apple, (b) Almond  gametes  (to  form  a  zygote)  is  called fertilisation  (Fig.  8.11).  The  zygote develops into an embryo.  8.3 FRUITS AND SEED FORMATION After fertilisation, the ovary grows into a fruit and other parts of the flower fall off. The fruit is the ripened ovary. The seeds develop from the ovules. The seed contains  an  embryo  enclosed  in  a protective seed coat.  Some fruits are fleshy and juicy such as mango and orange. Some fruits are hard  like  almonds  and  walnuts [Fig. 8.12 (a) and (b)].  8.4 SEED DISPERSAL In nature same kind of plants grow at different places. This happens because seeds are dispersed to different places. Sometimes after a walk through a forest or a field or a park, you may have found seeds or fruits sticking to your clothes.  REPRODUCTION IN PLANTS  87  Rationalised 2023-24Did you try to observe how these seeds were clinging to your clothes?  What do you think will happen if all seeds of a plant were to fall at the same place and grow there? There would be severe competition for sunlight, water, minerals and space. As a result the seeds would  not  grow  into  healthy  plants. Plants  benefit  by  seed  dispersal.  It prevents competition between the plant and its own seedlings for sunlight, water and minerals. It also enables the plants to  invade  new  habitats  for  wider distribution.  Seeds and fruits of plants are carried away  by  wind,  water  and  animals. Winged seeds such as those of drumstick and  maple  [Fig.  8.13  (a)  and  (b)],  light  seeds  of  grasses  or  hairy  seeds  of  aak (Madar)  and  hairy  fruit  of  sunflower [Fig. 8.14 (a), (b)], get blown off with the wind to far away places. Some seeds are dispersed by water. These fruits or seeds usually  develop  floating  ability  in  the form of spongy or fibrous outer coat as in coconut. Some seeds are dispersed by animals,  especially  spiny  seeds  with hooks which get attached to the bodies of  animals  and  are  carried  to  distant places.  Examples  are  Xanthium (Fig. 8.15) and Urena.  Some seeds are dispersed when the fruits burst with sudden jerks. The seeds are scattered far from the parent plant. This happens in the case of castor and balsam.

In self-pollination,  pollen  grains  are  transferred  from  the  anther  to  the stigma  of  the  same  flower.  In  cross-pollination,  pollen  grains  are transferred from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower of the same kind.   Pollination takes place in plants with the help of wind, water and insects.   The fusion of male and female gametes is called fertilisation.  Fertilised egg is called zygote. Zygote develops into an embryo.   Fruit is the mature ovary whereas ovule develops into a seed, which  contains the developing embryo.   Seed dispersal is aided by wind, water and animals.   Seed dispersal helps the plants to (i) prevent overcrowding, (ii) avoid competition for sunlight, water and minerals and (iii) invade new habitats.

8,8,0,"Motion and Time  9 In Class VI, you learnt about different  types of motions. You learnt that a motion could be along a straight line, it could be circular or periodic. Can you recall these three types of motions?  Table  9.1  gives  some  common examples of motions. Identify the type of motion in each case.  Table 9.1 Some examples of different types of motion  Example  of  Type of motion  Along  a  straight line/circular/ periodic  motion  Soldiers  in  a march past  Bullock cart moving on a straight road  Hands of an athlete in a race  Pedal of a bicycle in motion  Motion  of  the  Earth around  the  Sun  Motion  of  a  swing  Motion  of a pendulum  It  is  common  experience  that  the motion of some objects is slow while that of some others is fast.  9.1 SLOW OR FAST We know that some vehicles move faster than others. Even the same vehicle may move faster or slower at different times. Make a list of ten objects moving along a  straight  path.  Group  the  motion  of these objects as slow and fast. How did you decide which object is moving slow and which one is moving fast?  If  vehicles  are  moving  on  a  road  in the  same  direction,  we  can  easily  tell which one of them is moving faster than the other. Let us look at the motion of vehicles moving on a road.  Activity  9.1  Look at Fig. 9.1. It shows the position of  some  vehicles  moving  on  a  road  in the  same  direction  at  some  instant  of time. Now look at Fig. 9.2. It shows the position of the same vehicles after some time. From your observation of the two figures, answer the following questions: Which vehicle is moving the fastest of all? Which one of them is moving the slowest of all?  The distance moved by objects in a given  interval  of  time  can  help  us  to decide which one is faster or slower. For example, imagine that you have gone to see  off  your  friend  at  the  bus  stand. Suppose you start pedalling your bicycle at the same time as the bus begins to  Rationalised 2023-24it is easy to decide whose speed is the highest. One who takes shortest  time  to  cover  the distance of 100 metres has the highest speed.  9.2 SPEED You are probably familiar with the  word  speed.  In  the examples given above, a higher speed seems to indicate that a given  distance  has  been covered in a shorter time, or a larger  distance  covered  in  a given time.  The most convenient way to find  out  which  of  the  two  or more objects is moving faster is  to  compare  the  distances moved by them in a unit time. Thus, if we know the distance covered  by  two  buses  in  one hour, we can tell which one is faster.  We  call  the  distance covered by an object in a unit time as the speed of the object. When we say that a car is moving  with  a  speed  of  50 kilometres per hour, it implies that it will cover a distance of 50 kilometres in one hour. However, a car seldom moves with a constant speed for  one  hour.  In  fact,  it  starts  moving slowly  and  then  picks  up  speed.  So, when we say that the car has a speed of 50  kilometres  per  hour,  we  usually consider only the total distance covered by  it  in  one  hour.  We  do  not  bother whether the car has been moving with  Fig. 9.1  Vehicles moving in the same direction on a road  Fig. 9.2  Position of vehicles shown in Fig. 9.1 after some time  move. The distance covered by you after 5 minutes would be much smaller than that covered by the bus. Would you say that the bus is moving faster than the bicycle?  We often say that the faster vehicle has a higher speed.  In a 100-metre race  MOTION AND TIME  93  Rationalised 2023-24a  constant  speed  or  not  during  that hour.  The  speed  calculated  here  is actually the average speed of the car. In this book we shall use the term speed for average speed. So, for us the speed is the total distance covered divided by the total time taken. Thus,  Speed =   Total distance covered Total time taken  In everyday life we seldom find objects moving with a constant speed over long distances or for long durations of time. If the speed of an object moving along a  straight  line  keeps  changing,  its motion is said to be non-uniform. On the other hand, an object moving along a straight line with a constant speed is  said  to  be  in  uniform  motion.  In this  case,  the  average  speed  is  the same as the actual speed.  We can determine the speed of a given object  once  we  can  measure  the  time taken by it to cover a certain distance. In Class VI you learnt how to measure distances.  But,  how  do  we  measure time? Let us find out.  9.3 MEASUREMENT OF TIME  If you did not have a clock, how would you decide what time of the day it is? Have you ever wondered how our elders could  tell  the  approximate  time  of  the day by just looking at shadows?  How do we measure time interval of  a month? A year?  Our  ancestors  noticed  that  many events in nature repeat themselves after definite intervals of time. For example,  they found that the sun rises everyday in the morning. The time between one sunrise and the next was called a day. Similarly, a month was measured from one new moon to the next. A year was fixed as the time taken by the earth to complete one revolution of the sun.  Often we need to measure intervals of time which are much shorter than a day. Clocks or watches are perhaps the most common time measuring devices. Have you ever wondered how clocks and watches measure time?  The  working  of  clocks  is  rather complex.  But  all  of  them  make  use  of some periodic motion. One of the most well-known periodic motions is that of a simple pendulum.  (a) Wall clock  (b) Table clock  (c) Digital clock  Fig. 9.3  Some common clocks  94  SCIENCE  Rationalised 2023-24to  A,  to  B  and  back  to  O.  The pendulum  also  completes  one oscillation  when  its  bob  moves from one extreme position A to the other  extreme  position  B  and comes back to A. The time taken by the pendulum to complete one oscillation  is  called  its  time period.  Activity  9.2  B  Set  up  a  simple  pendulum  as shown  in  Fig.  9.4  (a)  with  a thread or string of length nearly one  metre.  Switch  off  any  fans nearby.  Let  the  bob  of  the pendulum  come  to  rest  at  its mean  position.  Mark  the  mean position  of  the  bob  on  the  floor below it or on the wall behind it. To measure the time period of the  pendulum  we  will  need a  stopwatch.  However,  if  a stopwatch is not available, a table clock or a wristwatch can be used. To  set  the  pendulum  in  motion, gently hold the bob and move it slightly to one side. Make sure that the string attached  to  the  bob  is  taut  while  you displace it. Now release the bob from its displaced position. Remember that the bob  is  not  to  be  pushed  when  it  is released.  Note  the  time  on  the  clock when  the  bob  is  at  its  mean  position. Instead of the mean position you may note the time when the bob is at one of its extreme positions. Measure the time the  pendulum  takes  to  complete  20 oscillations.  Record  your  observations  A  O  Fig. 9.4  (a) A simple pendulum  Fig. 9.4  (b) Different positions of the bob of an oscillating simple pendulum  A  simple  pendulum  consists  of  a small  metallic  ball  or  a  piece  of  stone suspended  from  a  rigid  stand  by  a thread [Fig. 9.4 (a)]. The metallic ball is called the bob of the pendulum.  Fig. 9.4 (a) shows the pendulum at rest in its mean position. When the bob of the pendulum is released after taking it slightly to one side, it begins to move to and fro [Fig. 9.4 (b)]. The to and fro motion  of  a  simple  pendulum  is  an example of a periodic or an oscillatory motion.  The  pendulum  is  said  to  have completed one oscillation when its bob, starting from its mean position O, moves  MOTION AND TIME  95  Rationalised 2023-24in Table 9.2. The first observation shown is just a sample. Your observations could be  different  from  this.  Repeat  this activity  a  few  times  and  record  your observations. By dividing the time taken for  20  oscillations  by  20,  get  the  time taken  for  one  oscillation,  or  the  time period of the pendulum.  Is the time period of your pendulum  nearly the same in all cases?  Note  that  a  slight  change  in  the initial displacement does not affect the time period of your pendulum.  Nowadays  most  clocks  or  watches have an electric circuit with one or more  Table 9.2 Time period of a simple pendulum  Length of the string = 100 cm  S.No. Time taken for 20 Time  period  oscillations  (s)  (s)  42  2.1  1.  2.  3.  cells.  These  clocks  are  called  quartz clocks.  The  time  measured  by  quartz clocks is much more accurate than that by the clocks available earlier.  Units of time and speed The basic unit of time is a second. Its symbol  is  s.  Larger  units  of  time  are minutes  (min)  and  hours  (h).  You already know how these units are related to one another.  What  would  be  the  basic  unit  of  speed?  Since the speed is distance/time, the basic unit of speed is m/s. Of course, it could also be expressed in other units such as m/min or km/h.  You  must  remember  that  the symbols  of  all  units  are  written  in singular. For example, we write 50 km and not 50 kms, or 8 cm and not 8 cms. Boojho  is  wondering  how  many seconds  there  are  in  a  day  and  how many  hours  in  a  year.  Can  you  help him?  There is an interesting story about the discovery that the time period of a given pendulum  is  constant.  You  might  have  heard  the  name  of  famous  scientist Galileo Galilie (A.D. 1564 –1642). It is said that once Galileo was sitting in a church. He noticed that a lamp suspended from the ceiling with a chain was moving slowly from one side to the other. He was surprised to find that his pulse beat the same number of times during the interval in which the lamp completed  one  oscillation.  Galileo  experimented  with  various  pendulums  to verify his observation. He found that a pendulum of a given length takes always the  same  time  to  complete  one  oscillation.  This  observation  led  to  the development  of  pendulum  clocks.  Winding  clocks  and  wristwatches  were refinements of the pendulum clocks.  96  SCIENCE  Rationalised 2023-24Different  units  of  time  are  used depending on the need.  For example, it is  convenient  to  express  your  age  in years  rather  than  in  days  or  hours. Similarly, it will not be wise to express in years the time taken by you to cover the  distance  between  your  home  and your school.  How small or large is a time interval of one second? The time taken in saying aloud “two thousand and one” is nearby one second. Verify it by counting aloud from  “two  thousand  and  one”  to  “two thousand  and  ten”.  The  pulse  of  a normal healthy adult at rest beats about 72 times in a minute that is about 12 times in 10 seconds.  This rate may be slightly higher for children.  Paheli wondered how time was measured when pendulum clocks were not available.  Many  time  measuring  devices  were used in different parts of the world before the pendulum clocks became popular. Sundials, water clocks and sand clocks are  some  examples  of  such  devices. Different designs of these devices were developed in different parts of the world (Fig. 9.5).  9.4 MEASURING SPEED Having learnt how to measure time and distance, you can calculate the speed of an object. Let us find the speed of a ball moving along the ground.  Activity  9.3  Draw a straight line on the ground with chalk  powder  or  lime  and  ask  one  of your friends to stand 1 to 2 m away from it. Let your friend gently roll a ball along the ground in a direction perpendicular to the line. Note the time at the moment the ball crosses the line and also when it  comes  to  rest  (Fig.  9.6).  How  much time does the ball take to come to rest?  The  smallest  time  interval  that  can  be  measured  with  commonly  available clocks and watches is one second. However, now special clocks are available that can measure time intervals smaller than a second.  Some of these clocks can measure time intervals as small as one millionth or even one billionth of a second. You might have heard the terms like microsecond and nanosecond. One microsecond is one millionth of a second. A nanosecond is one billionth of a second. Clocks that measure such small time intervals are used for scientific research. The time measuring devices used in sports can measure time intervals that are one tenth or one hundredth of a second. On the other hand, times of historical events are stated in terms of centuries or millenniums. The ages of stars and planet are often expressed in billions of years. Can you imagine the range of time intervals that we have to deal with?

You can  use  a  scale  or  a  measuring tape.  Let  different  groups  repeat  the activity.  Record  the  measurements  in Table  9.3.  In  each  case  calculate  the speed of the ball.  You may now like to compare your speed of walking or cycling with that of your  friends.  You  need  to  know  the distance of the school from your home or from some other point. Each one of you  can  then  measure  the  time  taken to cover that distance and calculate your speed. It may be interesting to know who amongst  you  is  the  fastest.  Speeds  of some  living  organisms  are  given  in  Fig. 9.6  Measuring the speed of a ball  98  SCIENCE  Rationalised 2023-24Table 9.3 Distance moved and time taken by a moving ball  Name of the group Distance moved by  Time  taken  (s)  the ball (m)  Speed  =  Distance/ Time  taken  (m/s)  Table 9.4, in km/h. You can calculate the speeds in m/s yourself.  Rockets,  launching  satellites  into earth’s orbit, often attain speeds up to 8 km/s. On the other hand, a tortoise can move only with a speed of about 8 cm/s. Can you calculate how fast is the rocket compared with the tortoise?  Once  you  know  the  speed  of  an object, you can find the distance moved by it in a given time. All you have to do is to multiply the speed by time. Thus, Distance covered = Speed × Time You can also find the time an object would  take  to  cover  a  distance  while moving with a given speed.  Time taken = Distance/Speed  Boojho wants to know whether there is any device that measures the speed.  You might have seen a meter fitted on  top  of  a  scooter  or  a  motorcycle. Similarly,  meters  can  be  seen  on  the dashboards  of  cars,  buses  and  other vehicles. Fig. 9.7 shows the dashboard of a car. Note that one of the meters has km/h  written  at  one  corner.  This  is called  a  speedometer.  It  records  the  Table 9.4 Fastest speed that some animals can attain  S.

The distance-time graph is a line graph. Let us learn to make such a graph.  Fig. 9.7  The dashboard of a car  speed  directly  in  km/h.  There  is  also another  meter  that  measures  the distance  moved  by  the  vehicle.  This meter is known as an odometer.  While going for a school picnic, Paheli decided  to  note  the  reading  on  the odometer  of  the  bus  after  every 30  minutes  till  the  end  of  the  journey. Later  on  she  recorded  her  readings  in Table 9.5.  Can you tell how far was the picnic spot from the school? Can you calculate the  speed  of  the  bus?  Looking  at  the Table, Boojho asked Paheli whether she can  tell  how  far  they  would  have travelled  till  9:45  AM.  Paheli  had  no answer  to  this  question.  They  went  to their  teacher.  She  told  them  that  one way  to  solve  this  problem  is  to  plot  a distance-time graph. Let us find out how such a graph is plotted.  100  SCIENCE  Rationalised 2023-24Oxygen  Other gases  Y  Fig. 9.9  A pie chart showing composition of air  Nitrogen  Y  80  70  60  50  40  30  20  10  ) g k  n  i (  t h g i e W  X  O  X  Y  Fig. 9.11  x-axis and y-axis on a graph paper  Therefore, we shall use only the shaded part of the graph shown in Fig. 9.11.

Mark the horizontal line as XOX'. It is known as the x-axis. Similarly mark the vertical line YOY'. It is called the y-axis. The point of  intersection  of  XOX'  and  YOY'  is known  as  the  origin  O.  The  two quantities between which the graph is drawn are shown along these two axes. We  show  the  positive  values  on  the x-axis  along  OX.  Similarly,  positive values  on  the  y-axis  are  shown  along OY.  In  this  chapter  we  shall  consider only  the  positive  values  of  quantities.  1.  2.  3.  4.  5.  6.  0  1   2  3  4  5  0  1  2  3  4  5  You can make the graph by following  the steps given below:  Draw  two  perpendicular  lines  to represent  the  two  axes  and  mark them as OX and OY as in Fig. 9.11.  Decide  the  quantity  to  be  shown along  the  x-axis  and  that  to  be shown along the y-axis. In this case  MOTION AND TIME  101  Rationalised 2023-24  we  show  the  time  along  the  x-axis and the distance along the y-axis.  Choose  a  scale  to  represent  the distance  and  another  to  represent the time on the graph. For the motion of the car scales could be Time: 1 min = 1 cm Distance: 1 km = 1 cm   Mark  values  for  the  time  and  the distance  on  the  respective  axes according  to  the  scale  you  have chosen.  For  the  motion  of  the  car mark the time 1 min, 2 min, … on the  x-axis  from  the  origin  O. Similarly, mark the distance 1 km, 2 km … on the y-axis (Fig. 9.12).  Now you have to mark the points on the  graph  paper  to  represent  each set of values for distance and time. Observation  recorded  at  S.  No.  1 in  Table  9.6  shows  that  at  time 0  min  the  distance  moved  is  also zero. The point corresponding to this set  of  values  on  the  graph  will therefore be the origin itself. After 1 minute, the car has moved a distance of 1 km. To mark this set of values look  for  the  point  that  represents 1 minute on the x-axis. Draw a line parallel  to  the  y-axis  at  this  point. Then  draw  a  line  parallel  to  the x-axis from the point corresponding to distance 1 km on the y-axis. The point  where  these  two  lines intersect represents this set of values on  the  graph  (Fig.  9.12).  Similarly, mark  on  the  graph  paper  the points  corresponding  to  different sets of values.

It  is  a  straight line. This is the distance-time graph for the motion of the car. If  the  distance-time  graph  is  a straight  line,  it  indicates  that  the object  is  moving  with  a  constant speed. However, if the speed of the object keeps changing, the graph can be of any other shape.  102  SCIENCE  Rationalised 2023-24Y  X  Fig. 9.14  Distance-time graph of the bus  Generally, the choice of scales is not as  simple  as  in  the  example  given  in Fig.  9.12  and  9.13.  We  may  have  to choose two different scales to represent the desired quantities on the x-axis and the y-axis. Let us try to understand this process with an example.  Let us again consider the motion of the bus that took Paheli and her friends to the picnic. The distance covered and time  taken  by  the  bus  are  shown  in Table 9.5. The total distance covered by the bus is 80 km. If we decide to choose a scale 1 km = 1 cm, we shall have to draw  an  axis  of  length  80  cm.  This  is not possible on a sheet of paper. On the other hand, a scale 10 km = 1 cm would require an axis of length only 8 cm. This scale is quite convenient. However, the graph  may  cover  only  a  small  part  of the graph paper.  Some of the points to be  kept  in  mind  while  choosing the  most  suitable  scale  for  drawing  a graph are:        the  difference  between  the  highest and  the  lowest  values  of  each quantity. the  intermediate  values  of  each quantity,  so  that  with  the  scale chosen it is convenient to mark the values on the graph, and to  utilise  the  maximum  part  of  the paper  on  which  the  graph  is  to  be drawn. Suppose that you are given a graph paper of size 25 cm × 25 cm. One of the scales which meets the above conditions and can accommodate the data of Table 9.5 could be  Distance: 5 km = 1 cm, and Time: 6 min = 1 cm Can you now draw the distance-time graph for the motion of the bus? Is the graph  drawn  by  you  similar  to  that shown in Fig. 9.13?  Distance-time  graphs  provide  a variety of information about the motion  MOTION AND TIME  103  Rationalised 2023-24when  compared  to  the  data  presented by a table. For example, Table 9.5 gives information about the distance moved by  the  bus  only  at  some  definite  time intervals. On the other hand, from the distance-time  graph  we  can  find  the distance  moved  by  the  bus  at  any instant  of  time.  Suppose  we  want  to know how much distance the bus had travelled at 8:15 AM. We mark the point corresponding to the time (8:15 AM) on the x-axis (Fig. 9.14). Suppose this point is A.  Next we draw a line perpendicular to the x-axis (or parallel to the y-axis) at  point A. We then mark the point, T, on the graph at which this perpendicular line  intersects  it  (Fig.  9.14).  Next,  we draw a line through the point T parallel to the x-axis. This intersects the y-axis at  the  point  B.  The  distance corresponding to the point B on the y- axis,  OB,  gives  us  the  distance  in  km covered  by  the  bus  at  8:15  AM.  How much is this distance in km? Can you now  help  Paheli  to  find  the  distance moved by the bus at 9:45 AM? Can you also find the speed of the bus from its distance-time graph?

First of all find the latitude of your city with the help of an atlas. Cut out a triangular piece of a cardboard such that its one angle is equal to the latitude of your place and the angle opposite to it is a right angle. Fix this piece, called gnomon, vertically along a diameter of a circular board a shown in Fig. 9.16. One way to fix the gnomon could be to make a groove along a diameter on the circular board.  Next, select an open space, which receives sunlight for most of the day. Mark a line on the ground along the North-South direction. Place the sundial in the sun as shown in Fig. 9.16.  Mark the position of the tip of the shadow of the gnomon on the circular board as early in the day as possible, say 8:00 AM. Mark the position of the tip of the shadow every hour throughout the day. Draw lines to connect each point marked by you with the centre of the base of the gnomon as shown in Fig. 9.16. Extend the lines on the circular board up to its periphery.

Paheli and Boojho had also set up the game by connecting an electric  circuit as suggested in Class VI. They had lots of  fun  trying  it  out  with  their  families and  friends.  They  enjoyed  it  so  much that  they  decided  to  suggest  it  to  a cousin  of  theirs  who  stayed  in  a different town. So, Paheli made a neat drawing  showing  how  the  various electric  components  were  to  be connected (Fig.10.1).  10.1 SYMBOLS OF ELECTRIC  COMPONENTS  Some common electric components can be represented by symbols. In Table 10.1, some  electric  components  and  their symbols  are  shown.  You  may  come across  different  symbols  for  these components in different books. However, in  this  book,  we  shall  be  using  the symbols shown here.  Look at the symbols carefully. In the symbol for the electric cell, notice that there is a longer line and a shorter but thicker parallel line. Do you recall that an electric cell has a positive terminal and a negative terminal? In the symbol of  the  electric  cell,  the  longer  line represents the positive terminal and the thicker,  shorter  line  represents  the negative terminal.  For  a  switch  the  ‘ON’  position  and the ‘OFF’ position are represented by the symbols  as  shown.  The  wires  used  to connect  the  various  components  in  a circuit are represented by lines.  In  Table  10.1,  a  battery  and  its symbol  are  also  shown.  Do  you  know what a battery is? Look at the symbol of a  battery.  Can  you  make  out  what  a battery  could  be?  For  some  of  the activities  we  may  need  more  than  one cell.  So,  we  connect  two  or  more  cells together  as  shown  in  Fig.10.2.  Notice  Fig. 10.1  Setup to check how steady your hand is  Can  you  draw   this  circuit conveniently?

However,  in  some  of  these devices the electric cells are not always placed one after the other as shown in Fig. 10.2. Sometimes the cells are placed side by side. Then how are the terminals of  the  cells  connected?  Look  carefully inside the battery compartment of any device. There is usually a thick wire or a  metal  strip  connecting  the  positive terminal  of  one  cell  to  the  negative terminal  of  the  next  cell  (Fig.10.3).  In order  to  help  you  to  place  the  cells correctly  in  the  battery  compartment, ‘+’ and ‘–’ symbols are usually printed there.

The symbol used for representing a  battery is shown in Table.10.1.  Let us now draw a circuit diagram of an electric circuit using symbols shown in Table 10.1.  Activity  10.1  Make  the  electric  circuit  shown  in Fig.  10.7.  You  used  a  similar  circuit in  Class  VI  to  make  an  electric  bulb glow. Do you remember that the bulb glows  only  when  the  switch  is  in  the ‘ON’ position? The bulb glows as soon as  the  switch  is  moved  to  the  ‘ON’ position.    Copy  this  electric  circuit  in  your notebook. Make also a circuit diagram of  this  circuit  using  symbols  for  the various electric components.  Is  your  diagram  similar  to  the  one  shown in Fig. 10.8?  It  is  much  easier  to  draw  a  circuit diagram  using  symbols.  Therefore,  we generally represent an electric circuit by its circuit diagram.  Fig.  10.9  shows  another  circuit diagram.  Is  it  identical  to  the  circuit diagram  shown  in  Fig.10.8?  In  which way is it different?  Would the bulb glow in this electric circuit? Recall that the bulb glows only when the switch is in the ‘ON’ position and the electric circuit is closed.

When the  bulb  gets  fused,  its  filament  is broken.  CAUTION  Never  touch  a  lighted  electric  bulb connected to the mains. It may be very hot  and  your  hand  may  get  burnt badly.  Do  not  experiment  with  the electric  supply  from  the  mains  or  a generator or an inverter. You may get an  electric  shock,  which  may  be dangerous. Use only electric cells for all the activities suggested here.  If the filament of the bulb is broken, would the circuit be complete?   Would the bulb still glow?  You  might  have  noticed  that  a glowing electric bulb become warm. Do you know why?  10.2 HEATING EFFECT OF ELECTRIC  CURRENT  Activity  10.2  Take  an  electric  cell,  a  bulb,  a  switch and connecting wires. Make an electric circuit  as  shown  in  Fig.10.9.  This activity has to be done using only one cell.  Keep  the  switch  in  the  ‘OFF’  112  SCIENCE  Rationalised 2023-24position.    Does  the  bulb  glow?  Touch the bulb. Now move the electric switch to the ‘ON’ position and let the bulb glow for a minute or so. Again touch the bulb. Do you feel any difference? After moving the  switch  back  to  the  ‘OFF’  position, touch the bulb again.  The  wire  gets  hot  when  an  electric current passes through it. This is the heating effect of the electric current. Can you think of any electric appliance where the heating effect of the electric current  is  used?    Make  a  list  of  such appliances.  Activity  10.3  Make a circuit as shown in Fig.10.10. Take about 10 cm long piece of nichrome wire and tie it between the nails. (You can get nichrome wire from an electric repair  shop  or  you  can  use  a  piece  of discarded  coil  of  an  electric  heater.) Touch  the  wire.  Now  switch  on  the current  in  the  circuit  by  moving  the switch to the ‘ON’ position. After a few  Fig. 10.10  CAUTION  Do  not  keep  the  switch  in  the  ‘ON’ position for a long time, otherwise the cell may become weak very quickly.  seconds touch the wire. (Do not hold it for a long time.) Switch off the current. Touch  the  wire  again  after  a  few minutes.  You might have seen an electric room heater  or  an  electric  heater  used  for cooking. All these contain a coil of wire. This coil of wire is called an element. You may have noticed that when these appliances  are  switched  on  after  Boojho  could  not  see  element  in  an electric  iron.    Paheli  told  him  that electrical  appliances,  such  as immersion heaters, hotplates, irons, geysers, electric kettles, hair dryers, have elements inside them. Have you ever  seen  the  element  in  any appliance?

The  amount  of  heat  produced  in  a wire  depends  on  its  material,  length and  thickness.  Thus,  for  different requirements,  the  wires  of  different materials  and  different  lengths  and thicknesses are used.  The  wires  used  for  making  electric circuits do not normally become hot. On the  other  hand,  the  elements  of  some electric appliances become so hot that they are easily visible. The filament of  Fig. 10.12  Glowing filament of an electric bulb (incandescent)  Incandescent electric bulbs (Fig. 10.12) are often used for lighting but they also give  heat.  It  means  that  a  part  of  electricity  consumed  is  used  in  producing heat. This is not desirable as it results in the wastage of electricity. The fluorescent tube-lights and compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) are better electricity efficient lighting  sources.  Nowadays,  the  use  of  light  emitting  diode  (LED)  bulbs  is increasing. For producing a given intensity of light, LED bulbs consume less electricity as compared to incandescent bulbs or fluorescent tubes or CFLs.Thus LED bulbs are much electricity efficient and therefore being preferred.  Fig. 10.13  Electric bulb, tube-light, CFL and LED  It is advised to use electrical appliances and gadgets, which are electricity efficient. Bureau of Indian Standards, New Delhi assigns a Standard Mark on products,  which is an assurance of conformity to the specifications called ISI mark  given on the products. It is therefore suggested to use ISI mark products.  Note:  Fluorescent  tubes  and  CFLs  contain  mercury  vapour,  toxic  in  nature. Therefore, damaged fluorescent tubes or CFLs need to be disposed off safely.  114  SCIENCE  Rationalised 2023-24Fig. 10.14  Fuse used in buildings  an electric bulb gets heated to such a high temperature that it starts glowing. If a large current passes through a wire, the wire may become so hot that it may  even  melt  and  break.  But  is  it possible for a wire to melt and break? Let us check it out.  Activity  10.4  Make the circuit we used for Activity 10.3 again. However, replace the cell with a battery  of  four  cells.  Also,  in  place  of the nichrome wire, tie a thin strand of steel wool. (The steel wool is commonly used  for  cleaning  utensils  and  is available in grocery shops.) If there are any fans in the room, switch them off. Now pass the current through the circuit for sometime. Observe the strand of steel wool carefully. Note what happens.  Does the strand of steel wool melt and break? Wires  made  from  some  special materials melt quickly and break when large  electric  currents  are  passed through them. These wires are used for making electric fuses (Fig.10.14). In all  Fig. 10.15  Fuses used in electrical appliances  buildings  fuses  are  inserted  in  all electrical circuits. There is a maximum limit  on  the  current  which  can  safely flow through a circuit. If by accident the current exceeds this safe limit, the wires  CAUTION  Never try to investigate an electric fuse connected  to  mains  circuit  on  your own.  You  may,  however,  visit  an electric repair shop and compare the burnt out fuses with the new ones.  One reason for excessive currents in electrical  circuits  is  the  direct touching of wires. This may happen if the insulation on the wires has come off  due  to  wear  and  tear.    This  may cause a short circuit. Another reason for  excessive  current  can  be  the connection of many devices to a single socket.  This may cause overload in the  circuit.  You  might  have  read reports  in  newspapers  about  fires caused  by  short  circuits  and overloads.  may become overheated and may cause fire. If a proper fuse is there in the circuit, it will blow off and break the circuit. A fuse  is  thus  a  safety  device  which  ELECTRIC CURRENT AND ITS EFFECTS  115  Rationalised 2023-24These  days  Miniature circuit  breakers  (MCBs) are  increasingly  being used  in  place  of  fuses. These are switches which automatically  turn  off when current in a circuit exceeds the safe limit. You turn  them  on  and  the circuit  is  once  again complete.  Look  for  ISI mark on MCBs also.

Bring a bar magnet  near  the  compass  needle. Observe  what  happens.  Now,  while watching the compass needle carefully, move  the  switch  to  the  ‘ON’  position.

Fig. 10.14 shows fuses  used  in  our  houses.  Fuses shown in Fig. 10.15 are generally used in electrical appliances.  We observed the heating effect of the electric current and learnt how we use it  to  our  advantage.  Does  the  electric current have other effects also?  10.3 MAGNETIC EFFECT OF  ELECTRIC CURRENT  Activity  10.5  Take the cardboard tray from inside a discarded  matchbox.  Wrap  an  electric  Fig. 10.18  Hans Christian Oersted  (A.D. 1777-1851)  116  SCIENCE  Rationalised 2023-24What do you observe? Does the compass needle deflect? Move the switch back to the  ‘OFF’  position.  Does  the  compass needle come back to its initial position? Repeat the experiment a few times.  Remember  not  to  switch  on  the current for more than a few seconds at a time. The electromagnet weakens the cell quickly if left connected.  What does this experiment indicate?  10.4 ELECTROMAGNET  We know that the needle of a compass is  a  tiny  magnet,  which  points  in north-south  direction.  When  we  bring a  magnet  close  to  it,  the  needle  gets deflected.  We  have  also  seen  that compass needle gets deflected when the current flows in a nearby wire. Can you connect the two observations? When the current flows through a wire, does the wire behave like a magnet?  This is what a scientist called Hans Christian  Oersted  (Fig.  10.18)  also wondered. He was the first person who noticed the deflection of compass needle every  time  the  current  was  passed through the wire.  So,  when  electric  current  passes through a wire, it behaves like a magnet. This is the magnetic effect of the electric current. In fact, an electric current can be used to make magnets. Do you find it too surprising?  Let us try it out.  Fig. 10.19  An electromagnet  Activity  10.6  Take  around  75  cm  long  piece  of insulated  (plastic  or  cloth  covered  or enamelled) flexible wire and an iron nail, say about 6–10 cm long. Wind the wire tightly around the nail in the form of a coil. Connect the free ends of the wire to the terminals of a cell through a switch as shown in Fig. 10.19.  Place some pins on or near the end of the nail. Now switch on the current. What happens? Do the pins cling to the tip of the nail? Switch off the current. Are the pins still clinging to the end of the nail?  The coil in the above activity behaves like a magnet when electric current flows through it. When the electric current is switched off, the coil generally loses its magnetism.  Such  coils  are  called electromagnets.  The  electromagnets can  be  made  very  strong  and  can  lift very heavy loads. Do you remember the crane about which you read in Chapter 10 of  Class  VI?  The  end  of  such  a  crane has a strong electromagnet attached to it. The electromagnets are also used to separate  magnetic  material  from  the junk. Doctors use tiny electromagnets to  take  out  small  pieces  of  magnetic material that have accidentally fallen in  ELECTRIC CURRENT AND ITS EFFECTS  117  Rationalised 2023-24the  eye.  Many  toys  also  have electromagnets inside them.  10.5 ELECTRIC BELL We are quite familiar with an electric bell. It has an electromagnet in it.  Let us see how it works.  Fig.  10.20  shows  the  circuit  of  an electric bell. It consists of a coil of wire wound on an iron piece.  The coil acts as an electromagnet. An iron strip with a  hammer  at  one  end  is  kept  close  to  Fig. 10. 20  Circuit of an electric bell  the  electromagnet.  There  is  a  contact screw near the iron strip. When the iron strip  is  in  contact  with  the  screw,  the current  flows  through  the  coil  which becomes  an  electromagnet.  It,  then, pulls the iron strip. In the process, the hammer at the end of the strip strikes the gong of the bell to produce a sound. However, when the electromagnet pulls the iron strip, it also breaks the circuit. The  current  through  the  coil  stops flowing.  Will  the  coil  remain  an electromagnet?  The coil is no longer an electromagnet. It no longer attracts the iron strip. The iron  strip  comes  back  to  its  original position and touches the contact screw again.  This  completes  the  circuit.  The current  flows  in  the  coil  and  the hammer strikes the gong again.   This process is repeated in quick succession. The hammer strikes the gong every time the  circuit  is  completed.    This  is  how the bell rings.  Keywords  Battery  Circuit diagram  Electric bell  Electromagnet  Heating effect of current  Magnetic effect of current  Electric components  Fuse  What you have learnt    It is convenient to represent electric components by symbols.

Think of an explanation.  Paheli and Boojho saw a magic trick sometime back. The magician placed an iron box on a stand. He then called Boojho and asked him to lift the box. Boojho could easily lift the box. Now the magician made a show of moving his stick around the box while muttering some thing. He again asked Boojho to lift the box. This time Boojho could not even move it. The magician again muttered some thing and now Boojho could lift the box.  The audience, including Paheli and Boojho, were very impressed with the  show  and  felt  that  the  magician  had  some  supernatural  powers.

What  happens  when light falls on a mirror?  You  have  learnt  in  Class  VI  that  a mirror changes the direction of light that falls on it. This change of direction by a mirror is called reflection of light. Can you recall the activity in which you got the  light  of  a  torch  reflected  from  a mirror? Let us perform a similar activity.  Activity  11.1  Take a torch. Cover its glass with a chart paper which has three narrow slits as shown  in  Fig.  11.5.  Spread  a  sheet  of  Fig. 11.3  Reflection of objects in water  at a lighted candle first through a straight pipe and then through a bent pipe (Fig. 11.2). Why was Boojho not able to see the candle flame through a bent pipe?  This  activity  showed  that light travels along straight lines. How can we change the path of  light?  Do  you  know,  what happens  when  light  falls  on  a polished or a shiny surface?  11.2  REFLECTION OF LIGHT One way to change the direction of light is to let it fall on a shiny surface. For example, a shining stainless steel plate or a shining steel  spoon  can  change  the direction of light. The surface of water can also act like a mirror and  change  the  path  of  light. Have you ever seen the reflection of  trees  or  buildings  in  water (Fig. 11.3)?  Paheli remembers the story of the lion and the rabbit  from  the  Panchtantra,  in  which  the rabbit  fooled  the  lion  by  showing  him  his reflection in water (Fig. 11.4).

This is the image of the slits.  This  activity  shows  how  light  gets  reflected from a plane mirror.  Let us play around with the images formed in mirrors and know a little more about them.  Activity  11.2  CAUTION  Handle the lighted candle with care. It is better if this activity is performed in the presence of a teacher or an elder person.  Place a lighted candle in front of a plane mirror. Try to see the flame of the candle in the mirror. It appears as if a similar candle is placed behind the mirror. The candle,  which  appears  behind  the mirror, is the image of the candle formed by  the  mirror  (Fig.  11.6).  The  candle itself is the object.  Now  move  the  candle  to  different positions in front of the mirror. Observe the image in each case.

Now direct the beam  of  light  on  the  mirror  from  the torch with slits. Place the torch in such a  way  that  its  light  is  seen  along  the chart  paper  on  the  board.  Now  adjust its  position  so  that  the  light  from  the torch  strikes  the  plane  mirror  at  an angle (Fig. 11.5).  Does the mirror change the direction of light that falls on it? Now move the torch slightly to either side. Do you find any change in the direction of reflected light?  Paheli wants to know, what makes things visible to us? Boojho thinks that objects are visible only when light reflected from them reaches our eyes. Do you agree with him?  LIGHT  125  Rationalised 2023-24Boojho noted in his notebook: Is it not surprising that my image is of the same size as me whether the mirror is small or large?  Was the image upright in each case? Did the flame appear on top of the candle as in the object? Such an image is called erect.  An  image  formed  by  a  plane mirror is erect and of the same size as the object.  Now  place  a  vertical  screen  behind the  mirror.  Try  to  obtain  the  image  of the candle on this screen. Can you get the image on the screen? Now place the screen in front of the mirror. Can you get the image on the screen now? You will  find  that  the  image  of  the  candle  cannot  be  obtained  on  the  screen  in either case.  What about the distance of the image from  mirror?  Let  us  perform  another activity.  Activity  11.3  Take a chess board. If a chess board is not available, draw on a chart paper 64 (8×8) squares of equal size. Draw a thick line  in  the  middle  of  the  paper.  Fix  a plane mirror vertically on this line. Place any  small  object,  such  as  a  pencil sharpner, at the boundary of the third square  counting  from  the  mirror (Fig.  11.7).  Note  the  position  of  the image.  Now  shift  the  object  to  the boundary  of  the  fourth  square.  Again note the position of the image. Did you find any relation between the distance of the image from the mirror and that of the object in front of it?  Fig. 11.7  Locating image in a plane mirror  Paheli made a note in her notebook: In a plane mirror the image is formed behind the mirror. It is erect, of the same size and is at the same distance from the mirror as the object is in front of it.  You  will  find  that  the  image is  at  the  same  distance  behind the mirror as the object is in front of it. Now verify this by placing the object anywhere on the chart paper.  126  SCIENCE  Rationalised 2023-2411.3  RIGHT OR LEFT! When  you  see  your  image  in  a  plane mirror, is it exactly like you?

Can   you  now  understand why the word ‘AMBULANCE’ is written as  in  Fig.  11.9 ?  When  the  driver  of  a vehicle ahead of an ambulance looks in her/his  rear  view  mirror,  she/he  can read  ‘AMBULANCE’  written  on  it  and give way to it. It is the duty of every one of  us  to  allow  an  ambulance  to  pass without blocking its way.

This plate acts as a plane mirror. My image is erect and is of the same size. Paheli saw her image using the back of a steel spoon. “Boojho look here! I can also see my erect image though it is smaller in size. This spoon also acts as a mirror of some kind”, said Paheli.  You  can  also  use  a  spoon  or  any curved  shining  surface  to  see  your image.  Activity  11.5  Take a stainless steel spoon. Bring the outer side of the spoon near your face and look into it. Do you see your image in it (Fig. 11.10)? Is this image different from what you see in a plane mirror? Is this image erect? Is the size of the image the same, smaller or larger?  Now  look  at  your  image  using  the inner side of the spoon. This time you may find that your image is erect and larger in size. If you increase the distance of  the  spoon  from  your  face,  you  may see your image inverted (Fig. 11.11). You can also compare the image of your pen or pencil instead of your face.  Fig. 11.11  Image from the inner side of a spoon  The curved shining surface of a spoon acts  as  a  mirror.  The  most  common example of a curved mirror is a spherical mirror.  If the reflecting surface of a spherical mirror is concave, it is called a concave mirror. If the reflecting surface is convex, then it is a convex mirror (Fig. 11.12).

We know that the image of an object formed  by  a  plane  mirror  cannot  be obtained on a screen. Let us investigate if it is also true for the image formed by a concave mirror.  Activity  11.6  CAUTION  You will conduct Activity 11.6 in the sunlight.  Be  careful,  never  look directly towards the Sun or its image as it may damage your eyes. You may look at the image of the Sun when it is thrown on a screen or a wall.  Fig. 11.14  A concave mirror forms a real image of the sun  Take  a  concave  mirror.  Hold  it  facing the Sun. Try to get the light reflected by the mirror on a sheet of paper. Adjust the distance of the paper until you get a sharp bright spot on it (Fig. 11.14). Hold the mirror and the sheet of paper steady for a few minutes. Does the paper start burning?  This bright spot is, in fact, the image of  the  Sun.  Notice  that  this  image  is formed  on  a  screen.  An  image  formed on  a  screen  is  called  a  real  image. Recollect that in Activity 11.2 the image formed by a plane mirror could not be obtained on a screen. Such an image is called a virtual image.  Now let us try to obtain on the screen the image of a candle flame formed by a concave mirror.  Activity  11.7  Fix  a  concave  mirror  on  a  stand  (any arrangement to keep the mirror steady would  do)  and  place  it  on  a  table (Fig. 11.15). Paste a piece of white paper on  a  cardboard  sheet  (say  about  LIGHT  129  Rationalised 2023-24Fig. 11.15  Real images formed by a concave mirror  15 cm × 10 cm). This will act as a screen. Keep a lighted candle on the table at a distance of about 50 cm from the mirror. Try to obtain the image of the flame on the screen. For this, move the screen till a sharp image of the flame is obtained. Make  sure  that,  the  screen  does  not  Fig. 11.16  Virtual image formed by a concave mirror  obstruct the light from the candle falling on  the  mirror.  Is  this  image  real  or virtual? Is it of the same size as the flame? Now  move  the  candle  towards  the mirror and place it at different distances from it. In each case try to obtain the image  on  the  screen.  Record  your observation in Table 11.1. Is it possible to obtain the image on the screen when the  candle  is  too  close  to  the  mirror (Fig. 11.16)?  We see that the image formed by a concave mirror can be smaller or larger in size than the object. The image may also be real or virtual.  Concave mirrors are used for many purposes. You might have seen doctors using  concave  mirrors  for  examining eyes,  ears,  nose  and  throat.  Concave mirrors  are  also  used  by  dentists to  see  an  enlarged  image  of  the  teeth (Fig.  11.17).

Did you get an image larger in size than the object?  Can  you  now  recognise  the  mirrors used  as  side  mirrors  in  automobiles? These are convex mirrors. Convex mirrors can form images of objects spread over a large area. So, these help the drivers to see the traffic behind them (Fig. 11.20).  11.5  IMAGES FORMED BY LENSES You might have seen a magnifying glass. It  is  used  to  read  very  small  print (Fig. 11.21). You might have also used it  to  observe  the  body  parts  of  a cockroach  or  an  earthworm.  The magnifying glass is actually a type of a lens. Lenses are widely used in spectacles, telescopes and microscopes. Try to add a few more uses of lenses to this list.  Get  some  lenses.  Touch  and  feel them. Can you find some difference just by  touching?  Those  lenses  which  feel thicker in the middle than at the edges are convex lenses [Fig. 11.22 (a)]. Those  which  feel  thinner  in  the  middle  than at  the  edges  are  concave  lenses [Fig.  11.22  (b)].  Notice  that  the  lenses are  transparent  and  light  can  pass through them.  (a)  (b)  Fig. 11.22  (a) A convex lens and (b) a concave lens  Let us play with lenses.  CAUTION  It is dangerous to look through a lens at  the  Sun  or  a  bright  light.  You should  also  be  careful  not  to  focus sunlight  with  a  convex  lens  on  any part of your body.  132  SCIENCE  Rationalised 2023-24Activity  11.9  Take a convex lens or magnifying glass. Put  it  in  the  path  of  sunrays.  Place  a sheet  of  paper  as  shown  (Fig.  11.23). Adjust the distance between the lens and the paper till you get a bright spot on the paper. Hold the lens and the paper in this position for a few minutes. Does the paper begin to burn?  Now replace the convex lens with a concave lens. Do you see a bright spot  Fig. 11.23  Real image of the sun by a convex lens  on  the  paper  this  time,  too?  Why  are you not getting a bright spot this time? We have seen in the case of mirrors that for different positions of the object the nature and size of the image change. Is it true for lenses also?  Let us find out.  Activity  11.10  Take a convex lens and fix it on a stand as you did with the concave mirror. Place it on a table. Place a lighted candle at a distance of about 50 cm from the lens [Fig. 11.25 (a)]. Try to obtain the image  A  convex  lens  converges  (bends inward) the light generally falling on it [Fig. 11.24 (a)]. Therefore, it is called a converging lens. On the other hand, a concave lens diverges (bends outward) the light and is called a diverging lens [Fig. 11.24 (b)].

Could this image be obtained on a screen? Is the image real or virtual? This is how a convex lens is used as a magnifying glass.  In a similar fashion study the images formed by a concave lens. You will find that the image formed by a concave lens  is always virtual, erect and smaller in size than the object (Fig. 11.27).  11.6 SUNLIGHT — WHITE OR  COLOURED?  Have  you  ever  seen  a  rainbow  in  the sky?  You  might  have  noticed  that  it appears usually after the rain when the Sun  is  low  in  the  sky.  The  rainbow  is  134  SCIENCE  Rationalised 2023-24Fig. 11.28  A rainbow  seen as a large arc in the sky with many colours (Fig. 11.28).  How many colours are present in a rainbow? When observed carefully, there are seven colours in a rainbow, though it may not be easy to distinguish all of them. These are — red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet.  Does this mean that the white light consists of seven colours?  Fig. 11.29  A CD placed in sun  You  might have seen that when you blow  soap  bubbles,  they  appear colourful.  Similarly,  when  light  is reflected  from  the  surface  of  a Compact  Disk  (CD),  you  see  many colours (Fig. 11.29).  On  the  basis  of  these  experiences, could  we  say  that  the  sunlight  is  a mixture  of  different  colours?  Let  us investigate.  Activity  11.11  Take a glass prism. Allow a narrow beam of sunlight through a small hole in the window  of  a  dark  room  to  fall  on  one face of the prism. Let the light coming out of the other face of the prism fall on  Paheli wants to tell you that you can see a rainbow only when your back is towards the sun.

Do you see colours similar  to  those  in  a  rainbow (Fig.  11.30)?  This  shows  that  the sunlight consists of seven colours. The sunlight is said to be white light. This means  that  the  white  light  consists  of seven  colours.  Try  to  identify  these colours and write their names in your notebook.  Can we mix these colours to get white  light? Let us try.  Activity  11.12  Take a circular cardboard disc of about 10  cm  diameter.  Divide  this  disc  into  seven  segments.  Paint  the  seven rainbow  colours  on  these  segments as  shown  in  Fig.  11.31  (a).  You  can also  paste,  coloured  papers  on these  segments.  Make  a  small  hole at  the  centre  of  the  disc.  Fix  the disc  loosely  on  the  tip  of  a  refill  of  a ball  pen.  Ensure  that  the  disc  rotates freely  [Fig.  11.31  (a)].  Rotate  the  disc in  the  daylight.  When  the  disc  is rotated  fast,  the  colours  get  mixed together  and  the  disc  appears to  be  whitish  [Fig.  11.31  (b)].  Such a disc is popularly known as Newton’s disc.  Fig. 11.31  (a) A disc with seven colours (b) It appears white on rotating  Paheli has a brilliant idea!

11,11,0,"Forests: Our Lifeline  12 One evening Boojho entered the  park with an elderly person. He introduced him to his friends. Prof Ahmad was a scientist working in the  university.  The  children  started playing  while  Prof  Ahmad  sat  on  a bench in the corner. He was tired as he had  participated  in  the  golden  jubilee celebrations of the town. After a while, the children also came and sat around him.  They  wanted  to  know  about  the celebrations. Prof Ahmad told them that after  the  cultural  programme,  the senior  people  discussed  the  town’s unemployment  problem.  A  plan  was proposed to put up a factory by clearing an  area  of  the  forest  just  outside  the town.  This  would  give  the  increasing population of the town a chance to get jobs. The children were very surprised when Prof Ahmad told them that many people had objected to this idea.  “This is because the forests serve as green lungs and water purifying systems in nature”, Prof Ahmad explained. The children  were  confused.  Prof  Ahmad realised that the children had not visited a  forest.  The  children  also  wanted  to know  more  about  the  forest,  so  they decided to visit it with Prof Ahmad.  12.1 VISIT TO A FOREST One  Sunday  morning,  the  children packed a few things like a knife, a hand lens,  a  stick,  a  notebook  and  walked together  through  a  forest  trail  near  a village. On their way, they met Tibu, a young boy of their age group, of nearby village, who was taking cattle for grazing along with his aunt. He was very agile, running here and there to keep the herd together.  When  he  saw  the  children, Tibu  also  started  walking  along  with them, while his aunt went on a different path. As soon as they entered the forest Tibu raised his hand and signalled them to  keep  quiet  because  noise  could disturb the animals living in the forest. Tibu then took them to a place at a height to show them the broad view of the  forest.  Children  were  surprised because  they  could  not  see  any  land (Fig.  12.1).  The  different  treetops  had formed green cover over the land. However, the cover was not uniformly green. The  Fig. 12.1  A view of a forest  142  SCIENCE  Rationalised 2023-24environment  was  peaceful  and  a  cool breeze was blowing. This made children quite fresh and happy.  While coming down, they got excited on hearing a sudden sound of birds and some noise from the top branches of the trees.  Tibu  told  them  to  relax  since  it was  a  normal  phenomenon  here. Because of the children’s presence, some monkeys had climbed higher up on the trees  where  they  disturbed  the  birds. Animals often give this type of warning call to alert other animals. Tibu also told that  many  other  animals  like  boar, bison, jackals, porcupine, elephants live in  the  deeper  areas  of  the  forest (Fig.  12.2).  Prof  Ahmad  cautioned children  that  they  should  not  go  deep into the forest.  Boojho and Paheli remembered that they  have  studied  about  forests  as  Fig. 12.3  Forest as habitat  an  example  of  a  habitat  in  Class  VI (Fig. 12.3). They could see now how the forest provides a home for many animals and plants.

The sun was barely visible through the leaves of the trees, making it quite dark inside the forest.  Activity  12.1  Observe the various things in your home and make a list of those which are made from  material  which  may  have  been obtained from the forest.  You might have many wooden items on  your  list  like  plywood,  fuel  wood, boxes,  paper,  matchsticks,  and furniture. Do you know that gum, oils, spices, fodder for animals and medicinal plants  are  also  some  of  the  products which we get from the forest (Fig. 12.5).  Bambooo  The  land  where  the  children  were walking was uneven and  covered  with many trees. Tibu helped them to identify sal,  teak,  semal,  sheesham,  neem, palash,  fig,  khair,  amla,  bamboo, kachnar (Fig. 12.4). Prof Ahmad pointed out  that  there  are  several  other  trees, shrubs, herbs and grasses in the forest. The forest floor and the trees were also  144  SCIENCE  Rationalised 2023-24Prof  Ahmad  asked  children  to  look up and observe how the branches of the tall trees look like a roof over the other plants in the forest. He told them that this is called a canopy (Fig. 12.7).  Activity  12.2  Visit  a  forest  or  a  park  in  your neighbourhood. Observe the trees and try to identify them. You can take the help of some elders or books on trees. List the characteristics of the trees that you observe, such as the height, shape of leaves, crown, flowers, and fruits. Also draw the crowns of some trees.  Prof  Ahmad  pointed  out  that  trees had crowns of different types and sizes. These  had  created  different  horizontal layers in the forest. These are known as understoreys (Fig. 12.7). Giant and tall trees constituted the top layer followed by shrubs and tall grasses, and herbs formed the lowest layer.  Based  on  the  products  that  we  get from plants, try to fill Table 12.1. One example of each plant is already given. Fill the table by adding more examples. Sheila  wondered  who  would  have planted these trees. Prof Ahmad replied that  in  nature  trees  produce  enough seeds.  The  forest  floor  provides favourable  conditions  for  them  to germinate  and  develop  into  seedlings  Honey  Sealing wax  Wooden statue  Catechu  Gum  Fig. 12.5  Forest products  and saplings.

Prof Ahmad said, “No, due to different climatic conditions there are variations in the types of trees and other plants. The  types  of  animals  also  differ  from forest to forest.”  A  few  children  were  busy  watching beautiful butterflies fluttering here and there on the flowers of shrubs and herbs.  Fig. 12.8  Forest floor  They  had  a  close  look  at  the  bushes. While doing that their hair and clothes had seeds and thorns clinging to them. They came across numerous insects, spiders,  squirrels,  ants  and  various other small animals on the bark of the trees,  plant  leaves  and  on  decaying leaves on the forest floor (Fig. 12.8). They started  making  sketches  of  these creatures. The forest floor seemed dark coloured and was covered with a layer of  dead  and  decaying  leaves,  fruits, seeds,  twigs  and  small  herbs.  The decaying matter was moist and warm. Children picked up various seeds and leaves for their collection. Walking over the  dead  leaf  layer  on  the  forest  floor was like walking over a spongy carpet! Is the decaying matter always warm? Prof Ahmad suggested that the children could  perform  an  activity  to  get  an answer to this question.  146  SCIENCE  Rationalised 2023-24Activity  12.3  Dig a small pit. Put vegetable waste and leaves in it. Cover them with soil. Add some water. After three days, remove the upper layer of the soil. Does the pit feel warm inside?  Paheli  asked,  “There  are  so  many trees here. Also, there are many forest like this. What difference will it make if we cut some trees for a factory?”  Prof  Ahmad  said,  “You  have  read about  autotrophs,  heterotrophs  and saprotrophs. You have learnt how green plants  produce  food.  All  animals, whether  herbivores  or  carnivores,  depend  ultimately  on  plants  for  food. Organisms which feed on plants often get  eaten  by  other  organisms,  and  so on.  For  example,  grass  is  eaten  by insects, which in turn, is taken by the frog. The frog is consumed by snakes. This  is  said  to  form  a  food  chain: Grass  insects  frog  snake  eagle. Many food chains can be found in the forest. All food chains are linked. If any one  food  chain  is  disturbed,  it  affects other  food  chains.  Every  part  of  the forest is dependent on the other parts. If we remove one component, say trees, all other components would be affected.”  Oxygen  Carbon dioxide  Photosynthesis  Decomposers  Nutrients  Soil  Water  Fig. 12.9  Interrelationship of plant, soil and decomposers in a forest  FORESTS: OUR LIFELINE  147  Rationalised 2023-24Prof  Ahmad  asked  children  to  pick up  leaves  from  the  forest  floor  and observe them under a hand lens. They found  tiny  mushrooms  over  the decaying leaves. They also saw an army of  tiny  insects,  millipedes,  ants  and beetle  on  them.  They  were  wondering how these organisms live there. Prof Ahmad explained that apart from these animals which are easily seen, there are several organisms  and  micro-organisms  that live  in  the  soil.  Paheli  wondered  what mushroom and other micro-organisms eat. Prof Ahmad replied that they feed upon the dead plant and animal tissues and convert them into a dark coloured substance called humus.  In which layer of the soil would you find humus? What is its importance to the soil?  The micro-organisms which convert the dead plants and animals to humus are  known  as  decomposers.  These micro-organisms play an important role in the forest. Soon, Paheli removed some dead leaves and discovered under them a  layer  of  humus  on  forest  floor.    The presence  of  humus  ensures  that  the nutrients  of  the  dead  plants  and animals are released into the soil. From there, these nutrients are again absorbed by the roots of the living plants. “What happens if an animal dies in the forest?” Sheila  asked.  Tibu  replied  the  dead animals become food for vultures, crows, jackals  and  insects.”  In  this  way,  the nutrients  are  cycled.  So,  nothing  goes waste in a forest (Fig. 12.9).  Paheli reminded Prof Ahmad that he had not explained why forests are called green lungs. Prof Ahmad explained that plants  release  oxygen  through  the process  of  photosynthesis.  The  plants help  to  provide  oxygen  for  animal respiration.  They  also  maintain  the  Paheli reminded their friends that they have studied photosynthesis in Chapter 1.

The children saw clouds forming in the  sky.  Boojho  recalled  what  he  had learnt about the water cycle in Class VI. Trees take in water from their roots and release  water  vapour  into  the  air through evaporation.  If there were fewer trees, how will the  water cycle be affected?  Tibu told them that the forest is not just home to plants and animals. Many people  also  live  in  the  forest.  Some  of  148  SCIENCE  Rationalised 2023-24them may belong to different tribes. Tibu explained  that  these  people  depend mostly on the forests. The forest provides them  with  food,  shelter,  water  and medicines.  They  have  traditional knowledge about many medicinal plants in the forest.  While  Boojho  was  drinking  water from a small stream, he saw some deer crossing  the  stream  (Fig.  12.11).  They disappeared into the bushes. The dense bushes  and  the  tall  grass  provide animals with the food and shelter. They  showed the children droppings of some animals,  and  explained  the  difference between  various  types  of  droppings. Prof  Ahmad  informed  them  that  the forest  officers  could  recognise  the presence of some animals in the forest by their droppings and footprints.  Boojho called every one and showed them a large, decaying heap of animal dropping.  Several  beetles  and  grubs were feeding on the heap and a bunch of  seedlings  was  sprouting.  “These seedlings are of the herbs and shrubs.

The  decaying  animal dung  also  provides  nutrients  to  the seedlings to grow”, said Prof Ahmad.  After listening to this, Boojho noted in his notebook, “By harbouring greater variety  of  plants,  the  forest  provides greater  opportunities  for  food  and habitat  for  the  herbivores.

The wide variety of animals helps the forest to regenerate and grow. Decomposers  help  in  maintaining  the supply of nutrients to the growing plants in the forest. Therefore, the forest is a ‘dynamic living entity’ — full of life and vitality.”  It  was  about  afternoon  and  the children  wanted  to  go  back.  Tibu  suggested another route for going back. While  they  were  going  back,  it  started raining. However, surprisingly, they saw that the raindrops were not hitting the forest floor directly. The uppermost layer of the forest canopy intercepted the flow of raindrops, and most of the water was coming down through the branches and the stems of the trees. From the leaves it  150  SCIENCE  Rationalised 2023-24was dripping slowly over branches of the shrubs  and  herbs  (Fig.  12.13).  They found that the ground was still dry. After about  half  an  hour,  the  rain  stopped. They  noticed  that  the  layer  of  dead leaves over the forest floor appeared wet now. But water did not stagnate in the forest.  Boojho thought that if it had rained so  heavily  in  his  town,  it  would  have flooded the drains and roads.  What would happen if it rains heavily  in your town?  Prof Ahmad told them that the forest also  acts  as  a  natural  absorber  of rainwater and allows it to seep. It helps maintain the water table throughout the year. Forests not only help in controlling floods but also help maintain the flow of water in the streams so that we get a steady  supply  of  water.  On  the  other hand, if trees are not present, rain hits the ground directly and may flood the area  around  it.  Heavy  rain  may  also damages the soil. Roots of trees normally bind  the  soil  together,  but  in  their absence  the  soil  is  washed  away  or eroded.  The children spent an hour at Tibu’s village on their way back. The weather of the village was quite pleasant. Villagers told them that due to the surrounding forest, they receive good rainfall. The air also remained cool. Noise pollution, too is  less  because  the  forest  absorbs  the noise of the nearby highway.  The children learnt about the history of the village. It surprised them that the villages  and  the  agricultural  fields  of  that area were created after clearing the forest  about  sixty  years  ago.  Tibu’s grandfather told them that when he was young, the village was not as large as it was  now.  It  was  also  surrounded by  forests.  Construction  of  roads, buildings,  industrial  development  and increasing  demand  of  wood  created pressure  on  the  forests  and  it  started vanishing.  He  was  not  happy  that  the forest  adjoining  their  village  is  not regenerating  and  is  on  the  verge  of disappearing  due  to  overgrazing  of animals  and  indiscriminate  felling  of trees.  Prof  Ahmad  said  that  if  we  did things wisely we could preserve forests and  environment  as  well  as  have development.  Children prepared a few pictures to show  the  consequences  of  such  an event.  At the end of the visit, Prof Ahmad asked  children  to  sum  up  the importance  of  forests.  The  children wrote: Forests provide us with oxygen. They protect soil and provide habitat to a  large  number  of  animals.  Forests help  in  bringing  good  rainfall  in neighbouring areas. They are a source of  medicinal  plants,  timber  and  many other useful products. We must preserve our forests.  What would happen if forests disappear?

12,12,0,"13  Wastewater Story  All  of  us  use  water  in  our  homes  and make it dirty.  Dirty! Are you surprised? Rich in lather, mixed with oil, black– brown water that goes down the drains from sinks, showers, toilets, laundries is  dirty.  It  is  called  wastewater.  This used  water  should  not  be  wasted.  We must clean it up by removing pollutants. Have  you  ever  thought  where  the wastewater goes and what happens to it?  13.1 WATER, OUR LIFELINE Clean water is a basic need of human being.  Let  us  make  a  mindmap  of  the many uses of clean water.  Activity  13.1  (We  have  given  one  example  of  the use of clean water. You can add many more.)  Clean water put to use  Drinking  Clean water that is fit for use is unfortunately not available to all. It has been reported that more than one billion of people have  no  access  to  safe drinking water. This accounts for a large number  of  water-related  diseases  and even deaths. People even children walk for  several  kilometres  to  collect  clean water.  Is  it  not  a  serious  matter  for human  dignity?  The increasing scarcity of fresh-water due  to  population  growth,  pollution, industrial development,mismanagement and other factors. Realising the urgency of the situation on the World Water Day, on  22  March  2005,  the  General Assembly  of  the  United  Nations proclaimed the period 2005– 2015 as the International  Decade  for  action  on “Water for life”. All efforts made during this  decade  aim  to  reduce  by  half  the number  of  people  who  do  not  have access to safe drinking water.  There has been perceptible progress in the direction of the aim but still there is a lot to achieve.  Cleaning  of  water  is  a  process  of removing  pollutants  before  it  enters  a water body or is reused. This process of wastewater  treatment  is  commonly  156  SCIENCE  Rationalised 2023-24known as “Sewage Treatment”. It takes place in several stages.  13.2 WHAT IS SEWAGE? Sewage is wastewater released by homes, industries, hospitals, offices and other users. It also includes rainwater that has run down the street during a storm or heavy  rain.  The  water  that  washes  off roads  and  rooftops  carries  harmful substances  with  it.  Sewage  is  a  liquid waste.  Most  of  it  is  water,  which  has dissolved and suspended impurities.  Activity  13.2  Locate an open drain near your home, school  or  on  the  roadside  and  inspect water flowing through it.  Record colour, odour and any other observation. Discuss with your friends and  your  teacher  and  fill  up  the following Table 13.1.  We know that  sewage is a complex mixture  containing  suspended  solids, organic  and  inorganic  impurities, nutrients,  saprophytes  and  disease causing  bacteria  and  other  microbes. These include the following. Organic impurities    – Human faeces, animal waste,  oil, urea (urine), pesticides, herbicides, fruit and vegetable waste, etc.  Inorganic impurities – Nitrates,  Phosphates, metals.  Nutrients                  – Phosphorus  and Nitrogen. Bacteria                    – Such as vibrio cholera which causes cholera and salmonella paratyphi which causes typhoid.  Other microbes         – Such as  protozones which cause dysentery.  13.3 WATER FRESHENS UP — AN EVENTFUL JOURNEY  In a home or a public building generally one set of pipes brings clean water and another  set  of  pipes  takes  away wastewater. Imagine that we could see through  the  ground.  We  would  see  a network of big and small pipes, called  Table 13.1 Contaminant survey  S.

It is like a transport system that carries sewage from the point of being produced to the point of disposal, i.e. treatment plant.  Manholes are located at every 50 m to 60 m in the sewerage, at the junction of  two  or  more  sewers  and  at  points where there is a change in direction.  Activity  13.3  Study the sewage route in your home/ school/building. Do the following:  Make  a  line  diagram  of  the  sewage  route.     Walk down the street or survey the campus  to  find  the  number  of manholes. If possible, observe open drain and record  which  living  organisms  are found in and around it. In case you do not have a sewerage system  in  your  locality,  find  out  how sewage is being disposed off.  Treatment of polluted water Perform the following activity. It will help you understand the processes that take place at the wastewater treatment plant.  Activity  13.4  Divide yourself into groups to perform the activity. Record observations at each stage:  Fill a large glass jar 3/4 full of water. Add some dirty organic matter such as  grass  pieces  or  orange  peels,  a small amount of detergent, and a few drops of an ink or any colour.   Cap the jar, shake it well and let the mixture  stand  in  the  sun  for  two days.   After  two  days,  shake  the  mixture and  pour  a  small  sample  into  test tube.  Label  this  test  tube  “Before treatment; Sample 1”. How does it smell?   Use an aerator from an aquarium to bubble air through the sample in the glass  jar.  Allow  several  hours  for aeration; leave the aerator attached overnight.  If  you  do  not  have  an aerator, use a mechanical stirrer or a  mixer.  You  may  have  to  stir  it several times.   The  next  day  when  aeration  is complete, pour another sample into a second test tube. Label it as “After aeration; Sample 2”.   Fold a piece of filter paper to form a cone. Wet the paper with tap water and then insert the cone in a funnel. Mount  the  funnel  on  a  support (as you have learnt in Class VI).  Place layers of sand, fine gravel and finally medium gravel in the funnel (Fig. 13.2). (An actual filtration plant does not use filter paper, but the sand filter is several metres deep).   Pour  the  remaining  aerated  liquid through  the  filter  into  the  beakers. Do not allow the liquid to spill over the filter. If the filtered liquid is not clear, filter it a few  times till you get clear water.   Pour  a  sample  of  the  filtered  water into  a  third  test  tube  labelled “Filtered; Sample 3”.  158  SCIENCE  Rationalised 2023-241. Wastewater  is  passed  through  bar screens.  Large  objects  like  rags, sticks, cans, plastic packets, napkins are removed (Fig. 13.3).  Fig. 13.2  Filtration process   Pour another sample of the filtered water into a fourth test tube. Add a small piece of a chlorine tablet. Mix well until the water is clear. Label the test tube “Chlorinated; Sample 4”.  Observe carefully the samples in all the  test  tubes.  Do  not  taste!  Just smell them! Now answer the following questions: (a) What changes did you observe in the appearance  of  the  liquid  after aeration?  (b) Did aeration change the odour? (c) What was removed by the sand filter? (d) Did chlorine remove the colour? (e) Did chlorine have an odour? Was it worse than that of the wastewater?  13.4 WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT  (WWTP)  Treatment  of  wastewater  involves physical,  chemical,  and  biological processes,  which  remove  physical, chemical  and  biological  matter  that contaminates the wastewater.  Fig. 13.3  Bar screen  2. Water then goes to a grit and sand removal  tank.  The  speed  of  the incoming wastewater is decreased to allow sand, grit and pebbles to settle down (Fig. 13.4).  Fig. 13.4  Grit and sand removal tank  3. The water is then allowed to settle in a large tank which is sloped towards the middle. Solids like faeces settle at the bottom and are removed with  WASTEWATER STORY  159  Rationalised 2023-24After  several  hours,  the  suspended microbes settle at the bottom of the tank as activated sludge. The water is then removed from the top.  The  activated  sludge  is  about  97% water.  The  water  is  removed  by  sand drying beds or machines. Dried sludge is  used  as  manure,  returning  organic matter and nutrients to the soil.  The treated water has a very low level of  organic  material  and  suspended matter. It is discharged into a sea, a river or into the ground. Nature cleans it up further.  Sometimes it may be necessary to  disinfect  water  with  chemicals  like chlorine  and  ozone  before  releasing  it into the distribution system.

Fig. 13.5  Water clarifer  a  scraper.  This  is  the  sludge.  A skimmer removes the floatable solids like oil and grease. Water so cleared is called clarified water (Fig. 13.5). The  sludge  is  transferred  to  a separate  tank  where  it  is  decomposed by  the  anaerobic  bacteria.  The  biogas produced in the process can be used as fuel or can be used to produce electricity. 4. Air is pumped into the clarified water to  help  aerobic  bacteria  to  grow. Bacteria consume human waste, food waste,  soaps  and  other  unwanted matter  still  remaining  in  clarified water (Fig. 13.6).

They  can harden  and  block  the  pipes.  In  an open drain the fats clog the soil pores reducing its effectiveness in filtering water.  Throw  oil  and  fats  in  the dustbin.   Chemicals  like  paints,  solvents, insecticides,  motor  oil,  medicines may  kill  microbes  that  help  purify water.  So  do  not  throw  them  down the drain.   Used tealeaves, solid food remains, soft toys, cotton, sanitary towels, etc. should also be thrown in the dustbin (Fig. 13.7). These wastes choke the drains.  They  do  not  allow  free  flow of  oxygen.  This  hampers  the degradation process.  Fig. 13.7  Do not throw everything in the sink  WASTEWATER STORY  161  Rationalised 2023-24In the year 2016, the Government of India has initiated a new mission known as “Swachh Bharat” under which a lot of drives such as proper sewage disposal and providing toilets for everyone have been started.  Vermi-processing  toilet  A design of  a toilet in which humans excreta is treated by earthworms has been tested  in  India.  It  has  been  found  to  be  a  novel,  low  water-use  toilet  for  safe processing of human waste. The operation of the toilet is very simple and hygienic. The human excreta is completely converted to vermi cakes — a resource much needed for soil.  13.6 SANITATION AND DISEASE Poor  sanitation  and  contaminated drinking  water  is  the  cause  of  a  large number of diseases.  Let  us  look  at  our  own  country.  A vast  number  of  our  people  are  still without  sewerage  facilities.  Where  do they relieve themselves?  A  very  large  fraction  of  our  people defecates in the open, on dry riverbeds, on railway tracks, near fields and many a  time  directly  in  water.  Untreated human  excreta  is  a  health  hazard.  It may  cause  water  pollution  and  soil pollution.  Both  the  surface  water  and groundwater get polluted. Groundwater is a source of water for wells, tubewells, springs  and  many  rivers.  Thus,  it becomes  the  most  common  route  for water  borne  diseases.  They  include cholera,  typhoid,  polio,  meningitis, hepatitis and dysentery.  Bhoojo wants to know how sewage is disposed of in an aeroplane.  13.7 ALTERNATIVE ARRANGEMENT FOR SEWAGE DISPOSAL  To improve sanitation, low cost onsite sewage  disposal  systems  are  being encouraged. Examples are septic tanks, chemical toilets, composting pits. Septic tanks are suitable for places where there is  no  sewerage  system,  for  hospitals, isolated buildings or a cluster of 4 to 5 houses.  Some  organisations  offer  hygienic on-site  human  waste  disposal technology. These toilets do not require scavenging. Excreta from the toilet seats flow  through  covered  drains  into  a biogas  plant.  The  biogas  produced  is used as a source of energy.  13.8 SANITATION AT PUBLIC PLACES  In  our  country  fairs  are  organised periodically.  A  large  number  of  people participate  in  them.  In  the  same  way railway  stations,  bus  depots,  airports, hospitals  are  very  busy  places. Thousands  of  people  visit  them  daily. Large  amount  of  waste  is  generated  162  SCIENCE  Rationalised 2023-24here.  It  must  be  disposed  of  properly otherwise epidemics could break out.  The  government  has  laid  down certain  standards  of  sanitation  but, unfortunately,  they  are  not  strictly enforced.  However, all of us can contribute in maintaining sanitation at public places. We should not scatter litter anywhere. If there is no dustbin in sight, we should carry the litter home and throw it in the dustbin.  Conclusion We all have a role to play in keeping our environment  clean  and  healthy.  You  must  realise  your  responsibility  in maintaining  the  water  sources  in  a healthy state. Adopting good sanitation practices should be our way of life. As an  agent  of  change  your  individual initiative  will  make  a  great  difference. Influence others with your energy, ideas and optimism. A lot can be done if people work together. There is great power in collective action.

This principle marks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our system and  causes  a  gap  between  the  school,  home  and  community.  The  syllabi  and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp boundaries between different subject areas. We hope these measures will take us significantly further in the direction of a child-centred system of education outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986).  The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must recognise that, given space, time  and  freedom,  children  generate  new  knowledge  by  engaging  with  the information passed on to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why other resources and sites of  learning  are  ignored.  Inculcating  creativity  and  initiative  is  possible  if  we perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge.  These  aims  imply  considerable  change  in  school  routines  and  mode  of functioning.  Flexibility  in  the  daily  time-table  is  as  necessary  as  rigour  in implementing the annual calendar so that the required number of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook proves for making children’s life at school a happy experience, rather than a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of curricular burden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages with greater consideration for child psychology and the time available for teaching. The textbook attempts to enhance this  endeavour  by  giving  higher  priority  and  space  to  opportunities  for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.  The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) appreciates the hard work done by the Textbook Development Committee responsible for this book.  We  wish  to  thank  the  Chairperson  of  the  advisory  group  in  Science  and Mathematics,  Professor  J.V.  Narlikar  and  the  Chief  Advisor  for  this  book, Prof. V.B. Bhatia for guiding the work of this committee. Several teachers contributed to the development of this textbook; we are grateful to their principals for making this possible. We are indebted to the institutions and organisations which have generously permitted us to draw upon their resources, material and personnel. We are especially grateful to the members of the National Monitoring Committee,  Rationalised 2023-24iv  appointed  by  the  Department  of  Secondary  and  Higher  Education,  Ministry  of Human Resource Development under the Chairpersonship of Professor Mrinal Miri and Professor G.P. Deshpande, for their valuable time and contribution. As an organisation committed to systemic reform and continuous improvement in the quality of its products, the NCERT welcomes comments and suggestions which will enable us to undertake further revision and refinement.

The National Education Policy 2020, also emphasises reducing the content load and providing opportunities for experiential learning with creative  mindset.  In  this  background,  the  NCERT  has  undertaken  the exercise to rationalise the textbooks across all classes. Learning Outcomes already  developed  by  the  NCERT  across  classes  have  been  taken  into consideration  in  this  exercise.  Contents  of  the  textbooks  have  been  rationalised  in  view  of  the following:  • Overlapping  with  similar  content  included  in  other  subject  areas  in  the  same  class  •  Similar  content  included  in  the  lower  or  higher  class  in  the  same subject  • Difficulty  level  • Content,  which  is  easily  accessible  to  students  without  much interventions from teachers and can be learned by children through self-learning or peer-learning  • Content, which is irrelevant in the present context  This  present  edition,  is  a  reformatted  version  after  carrying  out the  changes  given  above.  Rationalised 2023-24Blank  Rationalised 2023-24PREFACE  This book is the outcome of the efforts of the Textbook Development Committee appointed by the NCERT. The committee met a few times to interact with one another to improve the draft.  Then  there  was  a  review  meeting  in  which  many  experts  and  practicing  school teachers were invited to review the draft and suggest improvements.  By  and  large  we  have  stuck  to  the  format  of  the  Class  VI  book.  By  now,  famous characters, Boojho and Paheli, have been used to make the text interactive. Attempt has been made to recall children’s own experiences and build concepts around them. This is designed to connect science that they study in the school with their every-day life.  Many activities have been suggested to clarify concepts. Some of these activities are so simple that children can perform them on their own. The requirement of the apparatus required for the activities is minimal. We performed all the activities ourselves to ensure that there was no difficulty in performing them in the school situation. The activities should also  help  children  in  developing  skills  such  as  presentation  of  data  in  tabular  and graphical forms, reasoning and drawing inference from the given data.  The  language  of  the  book  has  been  kept  as  simple  as  possible.  A  large  number  of photographs, illustrations, cartoons, etc. have been included to make the book attractive. To help teachers evaluate children effectively, a large number of exercises have been given at the end of each chapter. The teachers are encouraged to frame additional exercises to test children’s understanding. Some challenging exercises have also been devised for those children who would like to appear for the National Talent Search Examination conducted by the NCERT.  We are conscious of the fact that there is a paucity of additional reading material for children. We have tried to address this problem by providing non-evaluative boxes. These boxes, in blue, contain additional information, anecdotes, stories, strange facts and other such interesting materials.  We all know that children are mischievous and playful by nature. Therefore, in order to prevent any untoward incident during the performance of the activities in the school or outside, necessary cautions, in red, have been inserted at various places in the book.  To prepare children to assume their roles as responsible citizens of tomorrow, attempt has been made to sensitise them to the issues concerning gender, religion, environment, health and hygiene, water scarcity and energy conservation. We have sought to weave into the text the value of cooperation and the importance of peer learning.  An important feature of the book is what we call ‘Extended Learning’. These are totally non-evaluative, and purely voluntary activities and projects. Some of the projects in this section have been designed to enhance children’s interaction with the experts, teachers, even  parents,  and  society  at  large.  The  children  are  required  to  collect  information  of various kind and draw conclusions of their own.  My request to teachers and parents is to use the book in the spirit in which it has been written. Encourage children to perform activities and learn by doing, rather than by rote.  Rationalised 2023-24viii  You can supplement, or even replace, the activities given here. If you feel that you have better alternatives, especially with your local/regional flavour, please write to us so that these activities could be used in the future editions of the book.  We have been able to include only a small subset of children’s experiences. You have a better knowledge of their experiences because you are in touch with them. Use them to illustrate  the  concepts  being  taught.  Above  all,  please  do  not  stifle  children’s  natural curiosity. Encourage them to ask questions, even if sometimes you feel uncomfortable. If you do not know the answer to a question on the spot, do not feel embarrassed. You can promise them to find the answer and deal with it later. Make a genuine attempt to get the answer from whatever resources are within your reach, such as senior school or college teachers, experts, libraries, internet, etc. If, in spite of your efforts, you cannot get the answer to some question, you could write to NCERT.  I must thank the NCERT for enabling us to talk to children through the medium of this book. Every member of the NCERT has been courteous and helpful to us. If you find this book useful and enjoy teaching/learning science through this book, the Editing Team and I shall consider ourselves well-rewarded.  V.B.

All  kind  of  questions  come  to  their minds and they collect them in their sacks.  Sometimes,  they  may  share some of these questions with you, as you read through the chapters.  Paheli and Boojho are also on the lookout  for  answers  to  many questions — sometimes the questions seem  answered  after  they  discuss them  with  each  other,  sometimes through  discussions  with  other classmates, teachers or their parents. Answers  to  some  questions  do  not seem available even after all these. They might need to experiment on their own, read books in the library, send questions to scientists. Just dig and dig and dig into all possibilities and see if the questions can be answered. Perhaps, they would carry some of the unanswered questions in their sacks to higher classes. What will really thrill them would be your adding questions to their sacks  or answers to their questions. Sometimes, activities are suggested in the textbook, results or findings of these by different groups of students would be of interest to other students and teachers. You can complete the suggested activities and send your results or findings to Paheli and Boojho. Do keep in mind that activities that involve using blades, scissors or fire need to be done strictly under the care of your teachers. Stick to the precautions given and then enjoy doing all the suggested activities. Mind, the book will not be able to help you much, if the activities are not completed!  We would like to advise you that you must make observations yourself and record whatever results you get. Keen and true observations are necessary for exploring any subject of study. For some reason your results may turn out to be different from those of your classmates. Do not worry. Try to find out the reason for these results instead of disregarding them. Do not ever copy results from your classmate.

14,14,0,"1 IntroductIon: tracIng changes   through a thousand Years  Map 1  A section of the world  map drawn by the  geographer al-Idrisi  in the twelfth century  showing the Indian  subcontinent from  land to sea.  Cartographer  A person who  makes maps.  Take a look at Maps 1 and 2. Map 1 was made in    1154   ce  by  the  Arab  geographer  Al-Idrisi.  The  section  reproduced  here  is  a  detail  of  the  Indian  subcontinent from his larger map of the world. Map 2  was made in the 1720s by a French cartographer. The  two maps are quite different even though they are of the  same area. In al-Idrisi’s map, south India is where we  would expect to find north India and Sri Lanka is the  island at the top. Place-names are marked in Arabic,   1  Unit 1 to 4.indd   1  11-05-2022   10:37:06  introduction: tra... Rationalised 2023-24Map 2  The subcontinent, from  the early-eighteenth-  century Atlas Nouveau  of Guillaume de l’Isle.   and  there  are  some  well-known  names  like  Kanauj  in Uttar Pradesh (spelt in the map as Qanauj). Map 2  was made nearly 600 years after Map 1, during this  period,  information  about  the  subcontinent  had  changed considerably. This map seems more familiar to  us and the coastal areas in particular are surprisingly  detailed. This map was used by European sailors and  merchants on their voyages.   ?  Look  at  the  areas  in  the  interior  of  the  subcontinent  on Map 2. Are they as detailed as those on the coast?  Follow the course of the River Ganga and see how it is  shown. Why do you think there is a difference in the level  of detail and accuracy between the coastal and inland  areas in this map?  2  Unit 1 to 4.indd   2  11-05-2022   10:37:09  our pasts – iiRationalised 2023-24Equally  important  is  the  fact  that  the  science  of  cartography  differed  in  the  two  periods.  When  historians read documents, maps and texts from the  past, they have to be sensitive to the different historical  backgrounds  –  the  contexts  –  in  which  information  about the past was produced.  new and old terminologies  If  the  context  in  which  information  is  produced  changes  with  time,  what  about  language  and  meanings?  Historical  records  exist  in  a  variety  of  languages  which  have  changed  considerably  over  the years. Medieval Persian, for example, is different  from modern Persian. The difference is not just with  regard to grammar and vocabulary; the meanings of  words also change over time.   Take the term “Hindustan”, for example. Today we  understand  it  as  “India”,  the  modern  nation-state.  When the term was used in the thirteenth century by  Minhaj-i-Siraj, a chronicler who wrote in Persian, he  meant  the  areas  of  Punjab,  Haryana  and  the  lands  between  the  Ganga  and  Yamuna.  He  used  the  term  in a political sense for lands that were a part of the  dominions of the Delhi Sultan. The areas included in  this term shifted with the extent of the Sultanate but  the term never included south India. By contrast, in  the  early  sixteenth  century,  Babur  used  Hindustan  to describe the geography, the fauna and the culture  of the inhabitants of the subcontinent. As we will see  later in the chapter, this was somewhat similar to the  way the fourteenth-century poet Amir Khusrau used  the  word  “Hind”.  While  the  idea  of  a  geographical  and  cultural  entity  like  “India”  did  exist,  the  term  “Hindustan”  did  not  carry  the  political  and  national  meanings which we associate with it today.   Historians today have to be careful about the terms  they use because they meant different things in the  past. Take, for example, a simple term like “foreigner”.  It is used today to mean someone who is not an Indian.    3  ?  Can you think of  any other words  whose meanings  change in  different contexts?   Unit 1 to 4.indd   3  11-05-2022   10:37:09  introduction: tra... Rationalised 2023-24In the medieval period, a “foreigner” was any stranger  who appeared say in a given village, someone who was  not a part of that society or culture. (In Hindi the term  pardesi might be used to describe such a person and  in  Persian,  ajnabi.)  A  city-dweller,  therefore,  might  have regarded a forest-dweller as a “foreigner”, but two  peasants living in the same village were not foreigners  to each other, even though they may have had different  religious or caste backgrounds.  historians and their sources  Historians use different types of sources to learn about  the  past  depending  upon  the  period  of  their  study  and  the  nature  of  their  investigation.  Last  year,  for  example, you read about rulers of the Gupta dynasty  and Harshavardhana. In this book we will read about  the following thousand years, from roughly 700 to 1750.   You will notice some continuity in the sources used  by  historians  for  the  study  of  this  period.  They  still  rely  on  coins,  inscriptions,  architecture  and  textual  records for information. But there is also considerable  discontinuity. The number and variety of textual records  increased dramatically during this period. They slowly  displaced other types of available information. Through  this period, paper gradually became cheaper and more    the value of paper  Compare the following:   (1) In the middle of the thirteenth century a scholar  wanted  to  copy  a  book.

People  used  it  to  write  holy  texts,  chronicles  of  rulers,  letters  and  teachings  of  saints,  petitions  and  judicial  records,  and  for  registers  of  accounts  and  taxes.  Manuscripts  were  collected  by  wealthy people, rulers, monasteries and temples. They  were placed in libraries and archives. These manuscripts  and documents provide a lot of detailed information to  historians but they are also difficult to use.   There was no printing press in those days so scribes  copied manuscripts by hand. If you have ever copied a  friend’s homework you would know that this is not a  simple  exercise.  Sometimes  you  cannot  read  your  friend’s handwriting and are forced to guess what is  written.  As  a  result  there  are  small  but  significant  differences  in  your  copy  of  your  friend’s  work.  Manuscript copying is somewhat similar. As scribes  copied manuscripts, they also introduced small changes   – a word here, a sentence there. These small differences  grew over centuries of copying until manuscripts of the   Archive A place where  documents and  manuscripts are  stored. Today all  national and state  governments have  archives where  they keep all their  old official records  and transactions.  Fig. 1 A painting of a scribe  making a copy of  a manuscript. This  painting is only  10.5 cm by 7.1 cm  in size. Because of  its size it is called a  miniature. Miniature  paintings were  sometimes used to  illustrate the texts of  manuscripts. They  were so beautiful that  later collectors often  took the manuscripts  apart and sold just  the miniatures.   5  Unit 1 to 4.indd   5  11-05-2022   10:37:10  introduction: tra...

This is a serious problem because we rarely  find the original manuscript of the author today. We  are totally dependent upon the copies made by later  scribes. As a result, historians have to read different  manuscript versions of the same text to guess what  the author had originally written.   On  occasion  authors  revised  their  chronicles  at  different  times.  The  fourteenth-century  chronicler  Ziyauddin  Barani  wrote  his  chronicle  first  in  1356  and  another  version  two  years  later.  The  two  differ  from  each  other  but  historians  did  not  know  about  the  existence  of  the  first  version  until  the  1960s.   It remained lost in large library collections.   new social and Political groups  The study of the thousand years between 700 and 1750  is a huge challenge to historians largely because of the  scale and variety of developments that occurred over  the period. At different moments in this period, new  technologies made their appearance – like the Persian   6  Unit 1 to 4.indd   6  11-05-2022   10:37:10  our pasts – iiRationalised 2023-24wheel in irrigation, the spinning wheel in weaving, and  firearms in combat. New foods and beverages arrived  in the subcontinent – potatoes, corn, chillies, tea and  coffee.  Remember  that  all  these  innovations – new  technologies and crops  – came along with people, who  brought other ideas with them as well. As a result, this  was a period of economic, political, social and cultural  changes. You will learn about some of these changes  in Chapter 5.   This  was  also  a  period  of  great  mobility.  Groups  of  people  travelled  long  distances  in  search  of  opportunity. The subcontinent held immense wealth  and the possibilities for people to carve a fortune. One  group of people who became important in this period  were the Rajputs, a name derived from “Rajaputra”,  the son of a ruler. Between the eighth and fourteenth  centuries,  the  term  was  applied  more  generally  to  a  group of warriors who claimed Kshatriya caste status.

Of the  technological,  economic, social  and cultural  changes described  in this section,  which do you  think were most  significant in the  town or village in  which you live?  The term included not just rulers and chieftains but  also  soldiers  and  commanders  who  served  in  the  armies of different monarchs all over the subcontinent.  A  chivalric  code  of  conduct  –  extreme  valour  and  a  great sense of loyalty – were the qualities attributed  to  Rajputs  by  their  poets  and  bards.  Other  groups  of people such as the Marathas, Sikhs, Jats, Ahoms  and  Kayasthas  (a  caste  of  scribes  and  secretaries)  also  used  the  opportunities  of  the  age  to  become   politically important.   Throughout  this  period  there  was  a  gradual  clearing of forests and the extension of agriculture,  a  change  faster  and  more  complete  in  some  areas  than in others. Changes in their habitat forced many  forest-dwellers to migrate. Others started tilling the  land and became peasants. These new peasant groups  gradually began to be influenced by regional markets,  chieftains,  priests,  monasteries  and  temples.  They  became a part of large, complex societies, and were  required  to  pay  taxes  and  offer  goods  and  services  to  local  lords.  As  a  result,  significant  economic  and  social  differences  emerged  amongst  peasants.  Some  possessed  more  productive  land,  others  also  kept cattle, and some combined artisanal work with  agricultural activity during the lean season. As society  became more differentiated, people were grouped into  jatis or sub-castes and ranked on the basis of their  backgrounds and their occupations. Ranks were not  fixed permanently, and varied according to the power,  influence  and  resources  controlled  by  members  of  the jati. The status of the same jati could vary from  area to area.   Jatis  framed  their  own  rules  and  regulations  to  manage  the  conduct  of  their  members.  These  regulations were enforced by an assembly of elders,  described in some areas as the jati panchayat. But jatis  were also required to follow the rules of their villages.  Several villages were governed by a chieftain. Together  they were only one small unit of a state.  8  Unit 1 to 4.indd   8  11-05-2022   10:37:11  our pasts – iiRationalised 2023-24  region and empire  Large  states  like  those  of  the  Cholas  (Chapter  2),  Tughluqs  (Chapter  3)  or  Mughals  (Chapter  4)  encompassed  many  regions.  A  Sanskrit  prashasti  (see Chapter 2 for an example of a prashasti ) praising  the  Delhi  Sultan  Ghiyasuddin  Balban  (1266-1287)  explained that he was the ruler of a vast empire that  stretched from Bengal (Gauda) in the east to Ghazni  (Gajjana) in Afghanistan in the west and included all  of south India (Dravida). People of different regions –  Gauda, Andhra, Kerala, Karnataka, Maharashtra and  Gujarat – apparently fled before his armies.

At the same time, they try to understand why rulers  kept  claiming  to  have  control  over  different  parts  of  the subcontinent.   Language and region   In 1318, the poet Amir Khusrau noted that there was   a  different  language  in  every  region  of  this  land:  Sindhi,  Lahori,  Kashmiri,  Dvarsamudri  (in  southern  Karnataka),  Telangani (in Andhra Pradesh), Gujari (in Gujarat), Ma‘bari  (in Tamil Nadu), Gauri, (in Bengal) … Awadhi (in eastern  Uttar Pradesh) and Hindawi (in the area around Delhi).  Amir  Khusrau  went  on  to  explain  that  in  contrast  to  these  languages,  there  was  Sanskrit  which  did  not  belong to any region. It was an old language and “common  people do not know it, only the Brahmanas do”.  Make  a  list  of  the  languages  mentioned  by  Amir  Khusrau. Prepare another list of the names of languages   spoken today in the regions he mentioned. Underline  the  names  that  are  similar  and  circle  those  that    are different.   Did you notice that the names by which languages  are known have changed over time?   ?  By  700  many  regions  already  possessed  distinct  geographical dimensions and their own language and  cultural  characteristics.  You  will  learn  more  about  these  in  Chapter  7.  They  were  also  associated  with  specific  ruling  dynasties.  There  was  considerable  conflict between these states. Occasionally dynasties  like  the  Cholas,  Khaljis,  Tughluqs  and  Mughals  were able to build an empire that was pan-regional –  spanning diverse regions. Not all these empires were  equally stable or successful.   10  Unit 1 to 4.indd   10  11-05-2022   10:37:14  our pasts – iiRationalised 2023-24When the Mughal Empire declined in the eighteenth  century, it led to the re-emergence of regional states  (Chapter 8). But years of imperial, pan-regional rule  had altered the character of the regions. Across most of  the subcontinent, the regions were left with the legacies  of the big and small states that had ruled over them.  This was apparent in the emergence of many distinct  and  shared  traditions:  in  the  realms  of  governance,  the  management  of  the  economy,  elite  cultures  and  language. Through the thousand years between 700  and  1750,  the  character  of  the  different  regions  did  not grow in isolation. These regions felt the impact of  larger pan-regional forces of integration without ever  quite losing their distinctiveness.   old and new religions  The thousand years of history that we are exploring  witnessed major developments in religious traditions.  People’s  belief  in  the  divine  was  sometimes  deeply  personal, but more usually it was collective. Collective  belief in a supernatural agency – religion – was often  closely  connected  with  the  social  and  economic  organisation of local communities. As the social worlds  of these groups altered, so too did their beliefs.  It  was  during  this  period  that  important  changes  occurred  in  what  we  call  Hinduism  today.  These  included the worship of new deities, the construction  of temples by royalty and the growing importance of  Brahmanas, the priests, as dominant groups in society.   Their  knowledge  of  Sanskrit  texts  earned  the  Brahmanas a lot of respect in society. Their dominant  position  was  consolidated  by  the  support  of  their  patrons – new rulers searching for prestige.    One of the major developments of this period was the  emergence of the idea of bhakti – of a loving, personal  deity  that  devotees  could  reach  without  the  aid  of  priests or elaborate rituals. You will be learning about  this, and other traditions, in Chapter 6.   11  ?  Find out whether  and for how long  your state was a  part of these   pan-regional  empires.   ?

Merchants  and  migrants first brought the teachings of the holy Quran  to India in the seventh century. Muslims regard the  Quran as their holy book and accept the sovereignty  of the one God, Allah, whose love, mercy and bounty  embrace all those who believe in Him, without regard  to social background.  Many rulers were patrons of Islam and the ulama –  learned theologians and jurists. And like Hinduism,  Islam  was  interpreted  in  a  variety  of  ways  by  its  followers. There were the Shia Muslims who believed  that  the  Prophet  Muhammad’s  son-in-law,  Ali,  was  the legitimate leader of the Muslim community, and  the  Sunni  Muslims  who  accepted  the  authority  of  the  early  leaders  (Khalifas)  of  the  community,  and  the succeeding Khalifas. There were other important  differences between the various schools of law (Hanafi  and  Shafi’i  mainly  in  India),  and  in  theology  and   mystic traditions.  thinking about time and                   historical Periods  Historians do not see time just as a passing of hours,  days  or  years  –  as  a  clock  or  a  calendar.  Time  also  reflects changes in social and economic organisation,  in  the  persistence  and  transformation  of  ideas  and  beliefs. The study of time is made somewhat easier by  dividing the past into large segments – periods – that  possess shared characteristics.   In  the  middle  of  the  nineteenth  century,  British  historians  divided  the  history  of  India  into  three  periods: “Hindu”, “Muslim” and “British”.  This division  was based on the idea that the religion of rulers was the  only important historical change, and that there were  no other significant developments – in the economy,  society  or  culture.  Such  a  division  also  ignored  the  rich diversity of the subcontinent.    12  Unit 1 to 4.indd   12  11-05-2022   10:37:14  our pasts – iiRationalised 2023-24Few historians follow this periodisation today. Most  look  to  economic  and  social  factors  to  characterise  the major elements of different moments of the past.  The histories you read last year included a wide range  of  early  societies  –  hunter-gatherers,  early  farmers,  people living in towns and villages, and early empires  and kingdoms. The histories you will be studying this  year are often described as “medieval”. You will find out  more about the spread of peasant societies, the rise of  regional and imperial state formations – sometimes at  the cost of pastoral and forest people – the development  of  Hinduism  and  Islam  as  major  religions  and  the  arrival of European trading companies.     These thousand years of Indian history witnessed  considerable  change.  After  all,  the  sixteenth  and  eighteenth  centuries  were  quite  different  from  the  eighth or the eleventh. Therefore, describing the entire  period as one historical unit is not without its problems.  Moreover, the “medieval” period is often contrasted with  the “modern” period. “Modernity” carries with it a sense  of material progress and intellectual advancement. This  seems to suggest that the medieval period was lacking  in any change whatsoever. But of course we know this  was not the case.   During these thousand years, the societies of the  subcontinent were transformed often and economies  in several regions reached a level of prosperity that  attracted the interest of European trading companies.  As you read this book, look out for signs of change  and the historical processes at work. Also, whenever  you  can,  compare  what  you  read  in  this  book  with  what  you  read  last  year.  Look  out  for  changes  and  continuities wherever you can, and look at the world  around you to see what else has changed or remained  the same.   13  Unit 1 to 4.indd   13  11-05-2022   10:37:14  introduction: tra...

Existing  kings  often  acknowledged  them  as  their  subordinates  or  samantas.  They  were expected to bring gifts for their  kings  or  overlords,  be  present  at  their  courts  and  provide  them  with  military support. As samantas gained  power  and  wealth,  they  declared  themselves  to  be  maha-samanta,  maha-mandaleshvara  (the  great  lord  of  a  “circle”  or  region)  and  so  on.  Sometimes  they  asserted  their  independence from their overlords.   One  such  instance  was  that  of  the  Rashtrakutas  in  the  Deccan.  Initially  they  were  subordinate  to  the  Chalukyas  of  Karnataka.  In  the  mid-eighth  century,  Dantidurga,  a  Rashtrakuta chief, overthrew his Chalukya overlord and  performed a ritual called hiranya-garbha (literally, the  golden womb). When this ritual was performed with  the help of Brahmanas, it was thought to lead to the  “rebirth” of the sacrificer as a Kshatriya, even if he was  not one by birth.     In  other  cases,  men  from  enterprising  families  used their military skills to carve out kingdoms. For  instance,  the  Kadamba  Mayurasharman  and  the  Gurjara-Pratihara Harichandra were Brahmanas who  gave up their traditional professions and took to arms,  successfully establishing kingdoms in Karnataka and  Rajasthan respectively.    administration in the kingdoms  Many  of  these  new  kings  adopted  high-sounding  titles such as maharaja-adhiraja (great king, overlord  of  kings),  tribhuvana-chakravartin  (lord  of  the  three  worlds) and so on. However, in spite of such claims,   17  Fig. 1 Wall relief from Cave  15, Ellora, showing  Vishnu as Narasimha,  the man-lion.  It is a work of the  Rashtrakuta period.  ?

In  each  of  these  states,  resources  were  obtained  from the producers – that is, peasants, cattle-keepers,  artisans – who were often persuaded or compelled to  surrender  part  of  what  they  produced.  Sometimes  these were claimed as “rent” due to a lord who asserted  that he owned the land. Revenue was also collected  from traders.   Four hundred taxes!  The  inscriptions  of  the  Cholas  who  ruled  in  Tamil  Nadu refer to more than 400 terms for different kinds  of taxes. The most frequently mentioned tax is vetti,  taken not in cash but in the form of forced labour, and  kadamai,  or  land  revenue.  There  were  also  taxes  on  thatching the house, the use of a ladder to climb palm  trees, a cess on succession to family property, etc.    Are any such taxes collected today?    ?  These  resources  were  used  to  finance  the  king’s  establishment, as well as for the construction of temples  and forts. They were also used to fight wars, which were in  turn expected to lead to the acquisition of wealth in the  form of plunder, and access to land as well as trade routes.  The  functionaries  for  collecting  revenue  were  generally  recruited  from  influential  families,  and  positions were often hereditary. This was true about  the army as well. In many cases, close relatives of the  king held these positions.  Prashastis and Land grants  Prashastis  contain  details  that  may  not  be  literally  true.  But  they  tell  us  how  rulers  wanted  to  depict  themselves  –  as  valiant,  victorious  warriors,  for  example. These were composed by learned Brahmanas,  who occasionally helped in the administration.    18  ?  In what ways  was this form of  administration  different from  the present-day  system?  Unit 1 to 4.indd   18  11-05-2022   10:37:18  our pasts – iiRationalised 2023-24the “achievements” of nagabhata  Many rulers described their achievements in prashastis  (you  read  about  the  prashasti  of  the  Gupta  ruler  Samudragupta last year).   One  prashasti,  written  in  Sanskrit  and  found  in  Gwalior,  Madhya  Pradesh,  describes  the  exploits  of  Nagabhata, a Pratihara king, as follows:  The kings of Andhra, Saindhava (Sind), Vidarbha (part of  Maharashtra) and Kalinga (part of Orissa) fell before him  even as he was a prince … He won a victory over Chakrayudha (the ruler of Kanauj) … He defeated the king of Vanga (part of Bengal), Anarta (part  of Gujarat), Malava (part of Madhya Pradesh), Kirata (forest  peoples), Turushka (Turks), Vatsa, Matsya (both kingdoms  in north India) …  Kings often rewarded Brahmanas by grants of land.  These were recorded on copper plates, which were given  to those who received the land.  ?  Also, see if you  can find some  of the areas  mentioned in the  inscription on  Map 1.  Other rulers made  similar claims as  well. Why do you  think they made  these claims?    Fig. 2 This is a set of copper  plates recording a  grant of land made  by a ruler in the ninth  century, written partly  in Sanskrit and partly  in Tamil. The ring  holding the plates  together is secured  with the royal seal, to  indicate that this is an  authentic document.   19  Unit 1 to 4.indd   19  11-05-2022   10:37:19  kings and kingdomsRationalised 2023-24What was given with the land  This is a part of the Tamil section of a land grant given  by the Cholas:   We have demarcated the boundaries of the land by making  earthen embankments, as well as by planting thorny bushes.  This is what the land contains: fruit-bearing trees, water,  land,  gardens  and  orchards,  trees,  wells,  open  spaces,  pasture-land, a village, anthills, platforms, canals, ditches,  rivers, silt-laden land, tanks, granaries, fish ponds, bee hives,  and deep lakes.  He who receives the land can collect taxes from it. He can  collect the taxes imposed by judicial officers as fines, the tax  on betel-leaves, that on woven cloth, as well as on vehicles.  He can build large rooms, with upper stories made of baked  bricks, he can get large and small wells dug, he can plant trees  and thorny bushes, if necessary, he can get canals constructed  for irrigation. He should ensure that water is not wasted, and  that embankments are built.   ?  List all the possible sources of irrigation mentioned  in the inscription, and discuss how these might  have been used.    Unusual for the twelfth century was a long Sanskrit  poem containing the history of kings who ruled over  Kashmir.  It  was  composed  by  an  author  named  Kalhana.  He  used  a  variety  of  sources,  including  inscriptions,  documents,  eyewitness  accounts  and  earlier  histories,  to  write  his  account.  Unlike  the  writers of prashastis, he was often critical about rulers  and their policies.  Warfare for Wealth   You  may  have  noticed  that  each  of  these  ruling  dynasties was based in a specific region. At the same  time, they tried to control other areas. One particularly    20  Unit 1 to 4.indd   20  11-05-2022   10:37:20  our pasts – iiRationalised 2023-24  ?  Look at Map 1 and  suggest reasons  why these rulers  wanted to control  Kanauj and the  Ganga valley.   ?  Look at Map 1  again and  discuss why the  Chahamanas  may have wanted  to expand their  territories.   prized  area  was  the  city  of  Kanauj  in  the  Ganga  valley. For centuries, rulers belonging to the Gurjara- Pratihara, Rashtrakuta and Pala dynasties fought for  control over Kanauj. Because there were three “parties”  in this long-drawn conflict, historians often describe  it as the “tripartite struggle”.   Rulers also tried to demonstrate their power and  resources  by  building  large  temples. So, when they  attacked one another’s kingdoms, they often chose to  target temples, which were sometimes extremely rich.  One such ruler is Mahmud of Ghazni, Afghanistan.  He raided the subcontinent 17 times (1000–1025) with  a religious motive. His targets were wealthy temples,  including that of Somnath, Gujarat. Much of the wealth  Mahmud carried away was used to create a splendid  capital city at Ghazni.  Other kings who engaged in warfare included the  Chahamanas,  later  known  as  the  Chauhans,  who  ruled over the region around Delhi and Ajmer. They  attempted  to  expand  their  control  to  the  west  and  the east, where they were opposed by the Chalukyas  of  Gujarat  and  the  Gahadavalas  of  western  Uttar  Pradesh.  The  Chahamana  ruler  was  Prithviraja  III  (1168 –1192),  who  defeated  an  Afghan  ruler  named  Sultan Muhammad Ghori in 1191, but lost to him the  very next year, in 1192.   a closer Look: the cholas  From Uraiyur to Thanjavur   How  did  the  Cholas  rise  to  power?  A  minor   chiefly  family  known  as  the  Muttaraiyar  held  power  in  the  Kaveri  delta.  They  were  subordinate  to  the  Pallava  kings  of  Kanchipuram.  Vijayalaya,  who  belonged  to  the  ancient  chiefly  family  of  the  Cholas  from  Uraiyur,  captured  the  delta  from  the  Muttaraiyar  in  the  middle  of  the  ninth  century.  He  built the town of Thanjavur and a temple for goddess   Nishumbhasudini there.   21  Unit 1 to 4.indd   21  11-05-2022   10:37:20  kings and kingdomsRationalised 2023-24Map 2 The Chola kingdom  and its neighbours.  The successors of Vijayalaya conquered neighbouring  regions and the kingdom grew in size and power. The  Pandyan and the Pallava territories to the south and  north  were  made  part  of  this  kingdom.  Rajaraja  I,  considered  the  most  powerful  Chola  ruler,  became  king in 985 and expanded control over most of these  areas.  He  also  reorganised  the  administration  of  the empire. Rajaraja’s son Rajendra I continued  his  policies and even invaded the Ganga valley, Sri Lanka  and countries of Southeast Asia, developing a navy for  these expeditions.  Splendid Temples and Bronze Sculpture   The  big  temples  of  Thanjavur  and  Gangaikonda- cholapuram,  built  by  Rajaraja  and  Rajendra,  are  architectural and sculptural marvels.    22  Unit 1 to 4.indd   22  11-05-2022   10:37:21  our pasts – iiRationalised 2023-24Fig. 3 The temple at   Gangaikondacholapuram.  Notice the way  in which the roof  tapers. Also look at  the elaborate stone  sculptures used to  decorate the outer  walls.    Chola temples often became the nuclei of settlements  which grew around them. These were centres of craft  production. Temples were also endowed with land by  rulers as well as by others. The produce of this land  went into maintaining all the specialists who worked  at  the  temple  and  very  often  lived  near  it  –  priests,  garland makers, cooks, sweepers, musicians, dancers,  etc. In other words, temples were not only places of  worship; they were the centres of economic, social and  cultural life.   Amongst  the  crafts  associated  with  temples,  the  making  of  bronze  images  was  the  most  distinctive.  Chola  bronze  images  are  considered  amongst  the  finest in the world. While most images were of deities,  sometimes images were made of devotees as well.   23  Unit 1 to 4.indd   23  11-05-2022   10:37:23  kings and kingdomsRationalised 2023-24Agriculture and Irrigation   Many  of  the  achievements  of  the  Cholas  were  made  possible  through  new  developments  in  agriculture. Look at Map 2 again. Notice that  the  river  Kaveri  branches  off  into  several  small  channels  before  emptying  into  the  Bay  of  Bengal.  These  channels  overflow  frequently,  depositing  fertile  soil  on  their  banks.  Water  from  the  channels  also  provides  the  necessary  moisture  for  agriculture,  particularly  the   cultivation of rice.  Although  agriculture  had  developed  earlier  in  other  parts  of  Tamil  Nadu,  it  was   only  from  the  fifth  or  sixth  century that this area was opened  up  for  large-scale  cultivation.  Forests  had  to  be  cleared  in  some  regions;  land  had  to  be  levelled  in  other  areas. In the delta region, embankments  had to be built to prevent flooding and  canals  had  to  be  constructed  to  carry  water  to  the  fields.  In  many  areas,  two  crops were grown in a year.  In  many  cases  it  was  necessary  to  water  crops  artificially.  A  variety  of  methods were used for irrigation. In some  areas  wells  were  dug.  In  other  places  huge  tanks  were  constructed  to  collect  rainwater.  Remember  that  irrigation  works  require  planning  –  organising   Fig. 4 A Chola bronze sculpture.

Most  of  the  new rulers, as well as people living in villages, took an  active interest in these activities.  The Administration of the Empire   How was the administration organised? Settlements  of  peasants,  known  as  ur,  became  prosperous  with  the  spread  of  irrigation  agriculture.  Groups  of  such  villages  formed  larger  units  called  nadu.  The  village  council  and  the  nadu  performed  several   administrative functions including dispensing justice  and collecting taxes.   Rich  peasants  exercised  considerable  control  over  the  affairs  of  the  nadu  under  the  supervision  of  the  central  Chola  government.  The  Chola  kings  gave some rich landowners titles like muvendavelan   (a  velan  or  peasant  serving  three  kings),  araiyar  (chief), etc., as markers of respect, and entrusted them   with important offices of the state at the centre.    25  Unit 1 to 4.indd   25  11-05-2022   10:37:24  kings and kingdomsRationalised 2023-24types of land  Chola inscriptions mention several categories of land: vellanvagai  land of non-Brahmana peasant proprietors  brahmadeya                                                   land gifted to Brahmanas  shalabhoga                                                     land for the maintenance of a school  devadana, tirunamattukkani                         land gifted to temples  pallichchhandam  land donated to Jaina institutions  We have seen that Brahmanas often received land  grants or brahmadeya. As a result, a large number of  Brahmana  settlements  emerged  in  the  Kaveri  valley  as in other parts of south India.    Each brahmadeya was looked after by an assembly  or sabha of prominent Brahmana landholders. These  assemblies worked very efficiently. Their decisions were  recorded in detail in inscriptions, often on the stone  walls  of  temples.  Associations  of  traders  known  as  nagarams also occasionally performed administrative  functions in towns.   Inscriptions  from  Uttaramerur  in  Chingleput  district,  Tamil  Nadu,  provide  details  of  the  way  in  which  the  sabha  was  organised.  The  sabha  had  separate  committees  to  look  after  irrigation  works,  gardens,  temples,  etc.  Names  of  those  eligible  to  be  members  of  these  committees  were  written  on  small  tickets  of  palm  leaf;  these  tickets  were  put  into  an  earthenware  pot,  from  which  a  young  boy  was  asked  to  take  out  the  tickets,  one  by  one  for   each committee.   26  Unit 1 to 4.indd   26  11-05-2022   10:37:24  our pasts – iiRationalised 2023-24                                               Inscriptions and texts  Who could be a member of a sabha? The Uttaramerur  inscription lays down:  All those who wish to become members of the sabha should  be owners of land from which land revenue is collected.  They should have their own homes.  They should be between 35 and 70 years of age.  They should have knowledge of the Vedas.  They  should  be  well-versed  in  administrative  matters                          and honest.  If anyone has been a member of any committee in the last  three years, he cannot become a member of another committee.  Anyone who has not submitted his accounts, and those of  his relatives, cannot contest the elections.   While inscriptions tell us about kings and powerful men,  here is an excerpt from the Periyapuranam, a twelfth-  century Tamil work, which informs us about the lives  of ordinary men and women.  On the outskirts of Adanur was a small hamlet of Pulaiyas            (a  name  used  for  a  social  group  considered  “outcastes”  by  Brahmanas  and  Vellalas),  studded  with  small  huts  under  old  thatches  and  inhabited  by  agrarian  labourers  engaged  in menial occupations. In the thresholds of the huts covered  with strips of leather, little chickens moved about in groups;  dark children who wore bracelets of black iron were prancing  about, carrying little puppies … In the shade of the marudu  (arjuna) trees, a female labourer put her baby to sleep on a  sheet of leather; there were mango trees from whose branches  drums were hanging; and under the coconut palms, in little  hollows on the ground, tiny-headed bitches lay after whelping.  The red-crested cocks crowed before dawn calling the brawny  Pulaiyar (plural) to their day’s work; and by day, under the  shade of the kanji tree spread the voice of the wavy-haired  Pulaiya women singing as they were husking paddy …  27  ?  Do you think  women  participated in  these assemblies?  In your view are  lotteries useful  in choosing  members of  committees?  ?  Were there any  Brahmanas in this  hamlet?  Describe all the  activities that  were taking place  in the village. Why do you  think temple  inscriptions  ignore these  activities?

16,16,0,"3 deLhI: 12th to 15th centurY  In Chapter 2 we saw that regions like the Kaveri delta     became the centre of large kingdoms. Did you notice  that  there  was  no  mention  of  a  kingdom  with  Delhi                 as  its  capital?  That  was  because  Delhi  became  an  important city only in the twelfth century.    Take a look at Table 1. Delhi first became the capital  of  a  kingdom  under  the  Tomara  Rajputs,  who  were  defeated  in  the  middle  of  the  twelfth  century  by  the  Chauhans (also referred to as Chahamanas) of Ajmer.   It was under the Tomaras and Chauhans that Delhi  became an important commercial centre. Many rich   Jaina  merchants  lived  in  the  city  and  constructed  several  temples.  Coins  minted  here,  called  dehliwal,  had  a   wide circulation.   Map 1  Selected Sultanate  cities of Delhi,  thirteenth-fourteenth  centuries.  The  transformation  of  Delhi  into a capital that controlled vast  areas of the subcontinent started  with  the  foundation  of  the  Delhi  Sultanate in the beginning of the  thirteenth century. Take a look at  Table 1 again and identify the five  dynasties that together made the  Delhi Sultanate.   The Delhi Sultans built many  cities  in  the  area  that  we  now             know  as  Delhi.

Rationalised 2023-24understanding delhi under the sultans Histories  are  known  as  tarikh  (singular)/tawarikh  (plural),  in  Persian,  the  language  of  administration  under the Delhi Sultans.  The  authors  of  tawarikh   were  learned  men:  secretaries,  administrators,  poets  and  courtiers,  who  both  recounted  events  and  advised  rulers  on  governance, emphasising the importance of just rule.   the circle of justice   Fakhr-i Mudabbir wrote in the thirteenth century:      A king cannot survive without soldiers. And soldiers cannot  live without salaries. Salaries come from the revenue collected  from  peasants.  But  peasants  can  pay  revenue  only  when  they are prosperous and happy. This happens when the king  promotes justice and honest governance.  Keep  the  following  additional  details  in  mind:   (1)  the  authors  of  tawarikh  lived  in  cities  (mainly  Delhi) and hardly ever in villages. (2) They often wrote  their histories for Sultans in the hope of rich rewards.   (3)  These  authors  advised  rulers  on  the  need  to  preserve an “ideal” social order based on birthright  and gender distinctions. Their ideas were not shared  by everybody.     In  1236  Sultan  Iltutmish’s  daughter,  Raziyya,  became  Sultan.  The  chronicler  of  the  age,  Minhaj-i  Siraj, recognised that she was more able and qualified  than all her brothers. But he was not comfortable at  having a queen as ruler. Nor were the nobles happy at  her attempts to rule independently. She was removed  from the throne in 1240.  ?  Do you think the  circle of justice  is an appropriate  term to describe  the relationship  between the king  and his subjects?   Birthright Privileges claimed  on account of  birth. For example,  people believed  that nobles  inherited their  rights to govern,  because they were  born in certain  families.  Gender  distinctions Social and  biological  differences  between women  and men. Usually,  these differences  are used to argue  that men are  superior to women.   32  Unit 1 to 4.indd   32  11-05-2022   10:37:35  our pasts – iiRationalised 2023-24What minhaj-i siraj thought about   raziyya   Minhaj-i Siraj thought that the queen’s rule went against  the ideal social order created by God, in which women  were supposed to be subordinate to men. He therefore  asked:  “In  the  register  of  God’s  creation,  since  her  account did not fall under the column of men, how did  she gain from all of her excellent qualities?”   On her inscriptions and coins Raziyya mentioned  that  she  was  the  daughter  of  Sultan  Iltutmish.  This  was  in  contrast  to  the  queen  Rudramadevi   (1262–1289), of the Kakatiya dynasty of Warangal,  part  of  modern  Andhra  Pradesh.  Rudramadevi  changed her name on her inscriptions and pretended  she  was  a  man.  Another  queen,  Didda,  ruled  in  Kashmir (980–1003). Her title is interesting: it comes  from “didi” or “elder sister”, an obviously affectionate  term given to a loved ruler by her subjects.   ?  Express Minhaj’s ideas in your own words. Do you  think  Raziyya  shared  these  ideas?  Why  do  you  think it was so difficult for a woman to be a ruler?   a closer Look: administration under  the khaljis and tughluqs  The  consolidation  of  a  kingdom  as  vast  as  the                      Delhi  Sultanate  needed  reliable  governors  and  administrators.  Rather  than  appointing  aristocrats  and  landed  chieftains  as  governors,  the  early  Delhi  Sultans,  especially  Iltutmish,  favoured  their  special  slaves purchased for military service, called bandagan  in Persian. They were carefully trained to man some  of the most important political offices in the kingdom.  Since they were totally dependent upon their master,  the Sultan could trust and rely upon them.   33  Unit 1 to 4.indd   33  11-05-2022   10:37:35  delhi: 12th to 15th... Rationalised 2023-24Client  Someone who  is under the  protection of  another; a  dependent or  hanger-on.   slaves rather than sons  The Sultans were advised:   A slave, whom one has brought up and promoted, must be  looked after for it needs a whole lifetime and good luck to  find  a  worthy  and  experienced  slave.  Wise  men  have  said  that a worthy and experienced slave is better than a son … ?  Can you think of any reason why a slave would  be better than a son?  The Khaljis and Tughluqs continued to use bandagan  and also raised people of humble birth, who were often  their  clients,  to  high  political  positions.  They  were  appointed  as  generals  and  governors.  However,  this  also introduced an element of political instability.   Slaves and clients were loyal to their masters and  patrons, but not to their heirs. Sultans had their own  servants. As a result the accession of a new monarch  often saw conflict between the old and the new nobility.  The  patronage  of  these  humble  people  by  the  Delhi  Sultans  also  shocked  many  elites  and  the  authors  of  Persian  tawarikh  criticised  the  Delhi  Sultans  for  appointing the “low and base-born” to high offices.   officials of sultan muhammad tughluq   Sultan Muhammad Tughluq appointed Aziz Khummar,  a  wine  distiller,  Firuz  Hajjam,  a  barber,  Manka  Tabbakh,  a  cook,  and  two  gardeners,  Ladha  and  Pira,  to  high  administrative  posts.  Ziyauddin  Barani,  a  mid-fourteenth-century  chronicler,  reported  their  appointments as a sign of the Sultan’s loss of political  judgement and his incapacity to rule.   Why do you think Barani criticised the Sultan?  ?  34  Unit 1 to 4.indd   34  11-05-2022   10:37:35  our pasts – iiRationalised 2023-24Like  the  earlier  Sultans,  the  Khalji  and  Tughluq  monarchs  appointed  military  commanders  as  governors of territories of varying sizes. These lands  were  called  iqta  and  their  holder  was  called  iqtadar  or muqti. The duty of the muqtis was to lead military  campaigns and maintain law and order in their iqtas.  In  exchange  for  their  military  services,  the  muqtis  collected the revenues of their assignments as salary.  They  also  paid  their  soldiers  from  these  revenues.  Control over  muqtis  was  most  effective if  their  office  was  not  inheritable  and  if  they  were  assigned  iqtas  for a short period of time before being shifted. These  harsh  conditions  of  service  were  rigorously  imposed  during the reigns of Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad  Tughluq. Accountants were appointed by the state to  check the amount of revenue collected by the muqtis.  Care was taken that the muqti collected only the taxes  prescribed by the state and that he kept the required  number of soldiers.   As  the  Delhi  Sultans  brought  the  hinterland  of  the cities under their control, they forced the landed  chieftains – the samanta aristocrats – and rich landlords  to accept their authority. Under Alauddin Khalji the  state brought the assessment and collection of land  revenue under its own control. The rights of the local  chieftains to levy taxes were cancelled and they were  also forced to pay taxes. The Sultan’s administrators  measured the land and kept careful accounts. Some of  the old chieftains and landlords served the Sultanate  as  revenue  collectors  and  assessors.  There  were  three  types  of  taxes:  (1)  on  cultivation  called  kharaj  and amounting to about 50 per cent of the peasant’s  produce, (2) on cattle and (3) on houses.   It  is  important  to  remember  that  large  parts  of  the  subcontinent  remained  outside  the  control  of  the Delhi Sultans. It was difficult to control distant  provinces  like  Bengal  from  Delhi  and  soon  after  annexing  southern  India,  the  entire  region  became  independent.  Even  in  the  Gangetic  plain,  there   35  Unit 1 to 4.indd   35  11-05-2022   10:37:35  delhi: 12th to 15th... Rationalised 2023-24were forested areas that Sultanate forces could not  penetrate. Local chieftains established their rule in  these regions. Sometimes rulers like Alauddin Khalji  and Muhammad Tughluq could force their control in  these areas but only for a short duration.   chieftains and their fortifications  Ibn Battuta, a fourteenth-century traveller from Morocco,  Africa, explained that chieftains sometimes   fortified themselves in mountains, in rocky, uneven and rugged  places as well as in bamboo groves. In India the bamboo is  not hollow; it is big. Its several parts are so intertwined that  even fire cannot affect them, and they are on the whole very  strong. The chieftains live in these forests which serve them  as  ramparts,  inside  which  are  their  cattle  and  their  crops.  There  is  also  water  for  them  within,  that  is,  rain  water  which collects there. Hence they cannot be subdued except  by powerful armies, who entering these forests, cut down the  bamboos with specially prepared instruments. ?  Describe the ways in which the chieftains arranged  for their defence.   The  Mongols  under  Genghis  Khan  invaded  Transoxiana in north-east Iran in 1219 and the Delhi  Sultanate  faced  their  onslaught  soon  after.  Mongol  attacks on the Delhi Sultanate increased during the  reign  of  Alauddin  Khalji  and  in  the  early  years  of  Muhammad Tughluq’s rule. This forced the two rulers  to mobilise a large standing army in Delhi which posed  a huge administrative challenge.   the sultanate in the Fifteenth and  sixteenth centuries  Take a look at Table 1 again. You will notice that after  the  Tughluqs,  the  Sayyid  and  Lodi  dynasties  ruled   36  Unit 1 to 4.indd   36  11-05-2022   10:37:35  our pasts – iiRationalised 2023-24from Delhi and Agra until 1526.  By then, Jaunpur,  Bengal,  Malwa,  Gujarat,  Rajasthan  and  the  entire  south India had independent rulers who established  flourishing states and prosperous capitals. This was  also the period which saw the emergence of new ruling  groups like the Afghans and the Rajputs.   Some of the states established in this period were  small but powerful and extremely well administered.  Sher Shah Sur (1540 –1545) started his career as the  manager  of  a  small  territory  for  his  uncle  in  Bihar  and  eventually  challenged  and  defeated  the  Mughal  emperor  Humayun  (1530 –1540,  1555 –1556).  Sher  Shah captured Delhi and established his own dynasty.  Although the Sur dynasty ruled for only fifteen years  (1540 –1555),  it  introduced  an  administration  that  borrowed  elements  from  Alauddin  Khalji  and  made  them  more  efficient.  Sher  Shah’s  administration  became the model followed by the great emperor Akbar                   (1556 –1605) when he consolidated the Mughal Empire.

17,17,0,"4 the mughaLs    (16th to 17th centurY)  Ruling as large a territory as the Indian subcontinent     with such a diversity of people and cultures was an  extremely difficult task for any ruler to accomplish in  the Middle Ages. Quite in contrast to their predecessors,  the Mughals created an empire and accomplished what  had  hitherto  seemed  possible  for  only  short  periods  of time. From the latter half of the sixteenth century,  they  expanded  their  kingdom  from  Agra  and  Delhi,  until in the seventeenth century they controlled nearly  all  of  the  subcontinent.  They  imposed  structures  of  administration and ideas of governance that outlasted  their  rule,  leaving  a  political  legacy  that  succeeding  rulers  of  the  subcontinent  could  not  ignore.  Today  the Prime Minister of India addresses the nation on  Independence Day from the ramparts of the Red Fort  in Delhi, the residence of the Mughal emperors.

From their mother’s side they were  descendants of Genghis Khan (died  1227), the Mongol ruler who ruled  over  parts  of  China  and  Central  Asia. From their father’s side, they  were the successors of Timur (died  1404),  the  ruler  of  Iran,  Iraq  and   modern-day  Turkey.  However,  the  Mughals  did  not  like  to  be  called Mughal or Mongol. This was  because  Genghis  Khan’s  memory  was  associated  with  the  massacre  of  innumerable  people.  It  was  also  linked with the Uzbegs, their Mongol  competitors. On the other hand, the  Mughals were proud of their Timurid  ancestry,  not  least  of  all  because  their  great  ancestor  had  captured  Delhi in 1398.  They  celebrated  their  genealogy  pictorially,  each  ruler  getting  a  picture made of Timur and himself.   mughal military campaigns   Babur,  the  first  Mughal  emperor  (1526 –1530),  succeeded  to  the  throne  of  Ferghana  in  1494  when  he  was  only  12  years  old.  He  was  forced  to  leave  his  ancestral  throne  due  to  the  invasion  of  another Mongol group, the Uzbegs.  A f t e r   y e a r s   o f   w a n d e r i n g ,   h e  seized  Kabul  in  1504.  In  1526  he   defeated the Sultan of Delhi, Ibrahim  Lodi, at Panipat and captured Delhi   and Agra.   Fig. 2 Mughal army on  campaign.   Fig. 3 Cannons were an  important addition  in sixteenth-century  warfare. Babur used  them effectively in the  first battle of Panipat.  40  Unit 1 to 4.indd   40  11-05-2022   10:37:39  our pasts – iiRationalised 2023-24Map 1 Military campaigns  under Akbar and  Aurangzeb.  mughal traditions of succession   The Mughals did not believe in the rule of primogeniture,  where  the  eldest  son  inherited  his  father’s  estate.  Instead  they  followed  the  Mughal  and  Timurid  custom  of  coparcenary  inheritance,  or  a  division  of  the inheritance amongst all the sons. Which do you  think is a fairer division of inheritance: primogeniture  or coparcenary?  mughal relations with other rulers  The  Mughal  rulers  campaigned  constantly  against  rulers  who  refused  to  accept  their  authority.  But  as  the  Mughals  became  powerful  many  other  rulers  also joined them voluntarily. The Rajputs are a good  example of this. Many of them married their daughters  into Mughal families and received high positions. But  many resisted as well.   41  mughal marriages  with the rajputs   The mother of  Jahangir was                    a Kachhwaha  princess, daughter  of the Rajput  ruler of Amber  (modern- day  Jaipur). The  mother of Shah  Jahan was a Rathor  princess, daughter  of the Rajput  ruler of Marwar  (Jodhpur).  Unit 1 to 4.indd   41  11-05-2022   10:37:40  the mughals Rationalised 2023-24The Sisodiya Rajputs of Mewar refused to accept  Mughal  authority  for  a  long  time.  Once  defeated,  however, they were honourably treated by the Mughals,  given  their  lands  (watan)  back  as  assignments   (watan jagir). The careful balance between defeating  but  not  humiliating  their  opponents  enabled  the  Mughals to extend their influence over many kings and  chieftains. But it was difficult to keep this balance all   the time.   Mansabdars and Jagirdars  As  the  empire  expanded  to  encompass  different  regions,  the  Mughals  recruited  diverse  bodies  of  people.  From  a  small  nucleus  of  Turkish  nobles  (Turanis) they expanded to include Iranians, Indian  Muslims,  Afghans,  Rajputs,  Marathas  and  other  groups.  Those  who  joined  Mughal  service  were  enrolled as mansabdars.  The term mansabdar refers to an individual who  holds a mansab, meaning a position or rank. It was  a grading system used by the Mughals to fix (1) rank,            (2)  salary  and  (3)  military  responsibilities.  Rank  and  salary  were  determined  by  a  numerical  value   called zat. The higher the zat, the more prestigious  was  the  noble’s  position  in  court  and  the  larger   his salary.  The  mansabdar’s  military  responsibilities  required  him  to  maintain  a  specified  number  of  sawar  or  cavalrymen.  The  mansabdar  brought  his  cavalrymen  for  review,  got  them  registered,  their  horses branded and then received money to pay them   as salary.  Mansabdars  received  their  salaries  as  revenue  assignments called jagirs which were somewhat like  iqtas.  But  unlike  muqtis,  most  mansabdars  did  not  actually reside in or administer their jagirs. They only  had rights to the revenue of their assignments which  was  collected  for  them  by  their  servants  while  the   mansabdars themselves served in some other part of  the country.   42  Zat ranking   Nobles with a  zat of 5,000  were ranked  higher than  those of 1,000.  In Akbar’s reign                 there were 29  mansabdars  with a rank of  5,000 zat; by  Aurangzeb’s  reign the number  of mansabdars            had increased to  79. Would this  have meant more  expenditure for           the state?   Unit 1 to 4.indd   42  11-05-2022   10:37:40  our pasts – iiRationalised 2023-24In  Akbar’s  reign,  these  jagirs were carefully assessed  so  that  their  revenues  were  roughly  equal  to  the  salary  o f   t h e   m a n s a b d a r .   B y  Aurangzeb’s  reign,  this  was  no  longer  the  case  and  the  actual revenue collected was  often  less  than  the  granted  sum. There was also a huge  increase  in  the  number  of  mansabdars, which meant a  long wait before they received a jagir. These and other  factors  created  a  shortage  in  the  number  of  jagirs.  As a result, many jagirdars tried to extract as much  revenue as possible while they had a jagir. Aurangzeb  was  unable  to  control  these  developments  in  the  last  years  of  his  reign  and  the  peasantry  therefore   suffered tremendously.   Zabt and Zamindars   The  main  source  of  income  available  to  Mughal  rulers  was  tax  on  the  produce  of  the  peasantry.  In  most  places,  peasants  paid  taxes  through  the  rural  elites, that is, the headman or the local chieftain. The  Mughals used one term – zamindars – to describe all  intermediaries, whether they were local headmen  of villages or powerful chieftains.  Akbar’s revenue minister, Todar Mal, carried  out  a  careful  survey  of  crop  yields,  prices  and  areas  cultivated  for  a  10-year  period,  1570 –1580.  On  the  basis  of  this  data,  tax  was fixed on each crop in cash. Each province  was divided into revenue circles with its own  schedule of revenue rates for individual crops.  This revenue system was known as zabt. It  was prevalent in those areas where Mughal  administrators could survey the land and keep  very careful accounts. This was not possible in   provinces, such as Gujarat and Bengal.   43  Fig. 4 A mansabdar on  march with his  sawars.

Unit 1 to 4.indd   43  11-05-2022   10:37:41  the mughals Rationalised 2023-24In some areas, the zamindars exercised a great deal  of power. The exploitation by Mughal administrators  could drive them to rebellion. Sometimes zamindars  and  peasants  of  the  same  caste  allied  in  rebelling  against  Mughal  authority.  These  peasant  revolts  challenged  the  stability  of  the  Mughal  Empire  from  the end of the seventeenth century.   Akbar Nama and Ain-i Akbari  Akbar ordered one of his close friends and  courtiers, Abul Fazl, to write a history of  his reign. Abul Fazl wrote a three-volume  history  of  Akbar’s  reign,  titled  Akbar  Nama. The first volume dealt with Akbar’s  ancestors and the second volume recorded  the  events  of  Akbar’s  reign.  The  third  volume  is  the  Ain-i  Akbari.  It  deals  with  Akbar’s administration, household, army,  the  revenues  and  the  geography  of  his  empire. It also provides rich details about  the  traditions  and  culture  of  the  people  living in India. The most interesting aspect  about the Ain-i Akbari is its rich statistical  details about things as diverse as crops,  yields, prices, wages and revenues.  Fig. 6 Akbar recieving the Akbar Nama  from Abul Fazl.  nur Jahan’s influence in Jahangir’s court  Mehrunnisa married the Emperor Jahangir  in 1611 and received the title Nur Jahan. She  remained extremely loyal and supportive  to  the  monarch.  As  a  mark  of  honour,  Jahangir  struck  silver  coins  bearing  his  own  titles  on  one  side  and  on  the  other  the inscription “struck in the name of the  Queen Begum, Nur Jahan”.   The  adjoining  document  is  an  order  (farman)  of  Nur  Jahan.  The  square  seal  states, “Command of her most Sublime and  Elevated Majesty Nur Jahan Padshah Begum”.  The round seal states, “by the sun of Shah  Jahangir she became as brilliant as the moon; may Nur  Jahan Padshah be the lady of the age”.  44  Fig. 7 Nur Jahan’s farman.

He consistently followed the  principle of “universal peace” (sulh-i kul).  the mughal empire in the seventeenth  century and after  The  administrative  and  military  efficiency  of  the  Mughal Empire led to great economic and commercial  prosperity. International travellers described it as the  fabled  land  of  wealth.  But  these  same  visitors  were  also appalled at the state of poverty that existed side  by  side  with  the  greatest  opulence.  The  inequalities  were  glaring.  Documents  from  the  twentieth  year  of  Shah Jahan’s reign inform us that the highest-ranking  mansabdars were only 445 in number out of a total  of 8,000. This small number – a mere 5.6 per cent of  the total number of mansabdars – received 61.5 per  cent of the total estimated revenue of the empire as  salaries for themselves and their troopers.   The Mughal emperors and their mansabdars spent  a  great  deal  of  their  income  on  salaries  and  goods.            This expenditure benefited the artisans and peasantry  who supplied them with goods and produce. But the  scale of revenue collection left very little for investment  in the hands of the primary producers – the peasant  and  the  artisan.  The  poorest  amongst  them  lived            from hand to mouth and they could hardly consider  investing in additional resources – tools and supplies –   45  Unit 1 to 4.indd   45  11-05-2022   10:37:42  the mughals Rationalised 2023-24to increase productivity. The wealthier peasantry and  artisanal groups, the merchants and bankers profited  in this economic world.  The  enormous  wealth  and  resources  commanded  by the Mughal elite made them an extremely powerful  group of people in the late seventeenth century. As the  authority of the Mughal emperor slowly declined, his  servants emerged as powerful centres of power in the  regions. They constituted new dynasties and held the  command  of  provinces  like  Hyderabad  and  Awadh.  Although  they  continued  to  recognise  the  Mughal  emperor in Delhi as their master, by the eighteenth  century the provinces of the empire had consolidated  their independent political identities.

18,18,0,"5 TriBeS, NomadS aNd   SeTTled CommuNiTieS  You  saw  in  Chapters  2,  3  and  4  how  kingdoms    rose and fell. Even as this was happening, new arts,  crafts  and  production  activities  flourished  in  towns  and  villages.  Over  the  centuries  important  political,  social and economic developments had taken place.  But  social  change  was  not  the  same  everywhere,  because different kinds of societies evolved  differently. It is important to understand  how and why this happened.  Fig. 1 Tribal dance,  Santal painted scroll.  In large parts of the subcontinent, society  was already divided according to the rules  of varna. These rules, as prescribed by the  Brahmanas, were accepted by the rulers  of large kingdoms. The difference between  the high and low, and between the rich and  poor, increased. Under the Delhi Sultans  and the Mughals, this hierarchy between  social classes grew further.   Beyond Big Cities: Tribal  Societies   There  were,  however,  other  kinds  of  societies  as  well.  Many  societies  in  the  subcontinent did not follow the social rules  and rituals prescribed by the Brahmanas.  Nor  were  they  divided  into  numerous  unequal classes. Such societies are often  called tribes.   49  Unit 5 to 7.indd   49  8/25/2022   12:23:00 PM  tribes, nomads andsettled communitiesRationalised 2023-24?  On a physical  map of the  subcontinent,  identify the areas  in which tribal  people may have  lived.  Members  of  each  tribe  were  united  by  kinship  bonds.  Many  tribes  obtained  their  livelihood  from  agriculture. Others were hunter-gatherers or herders.  Most  often  they  combined  these  activities  to  make  full use of the natural resources of the area in which  they  lived.  Some  tribes  were  nomadic  and  moved  from one place to another. A tribal group controlled  land and pastures jointly, and divided these amongst  households according to its own rules.   Many large tribes thrived in different parts of the  subcontinent.  They  usually  lived  in  forests,  hills,  deserts and places difficult to reach. Sometimes they  clashed with the more powerful caste-based societies.  In various ways, the tribes retained their freedom and  preserved their separate culture.   But  the  caste-based  and  tribal  societies  also  depended on each other for their diverse needs. This  relationship,  of  conflict  and  dependence,  gradually  caused both societies to change.  Who were Tribal People?   Contemporary  historians  and  travellers  give  very  scanty  information  about  tribes.  A  few  exceptions  apart, tribal people did not keep written records. But  they preserved rich customs and oral traditions. These  were passed down to each new generation. Present- day historians have started using such oral traditions  to write tribal histories.   Tribal people were found in almost every region of  the  subcontinent.  The  area  and  influence  of  a  tribe  varied at different points of time. Some powerful tribes  controlled  large  territories.  In  Punjab,  the  Khokhar  tribe  was  very  influential  during  the  thirteenth  and  fourteenth  centuries.  Later,  the  Gakkhars  became  more  important.  Their  chief,  Kamal  Khan  Gakkhar,  was made a noble (mansabdar) by Emperor Akbar. In  Multan and Sind, the Langahs and Arghuns dominated  extensive  regions  before  they  were  subdued  by  the  Mughals. The Balochis were another large and powerful   50  Unit 5 to 7.indd   50  17-05-2022   12:16:14  our pasts – iiRationalised 2023-24Map 1 Location of some  of the major Indian  tribes.  tribe in the north-west. They were divided into many  smaller  clans  under  different  chiefs.  In  the  western  Himalaya  lived  the  shepherd  tribe  of  Gaddis.  The  distant north-eastern part of the subcontinent too was  entirely dominated by tribes – the Nagas, Ahoms and  many others.  In many areas of present-day Bihar and Jharkhand,  Chero chiefdoms had emerged by the twelfth century.  Raja  Man  Singh,  Akbar’s  famous  general,  attacked  and defeated the Cheros in 1591. A large amount of  booty was taken from them, but they were not entirely  subdued. Under Aurangzeb, Mughal forces captured  many Chero fortresses and subjugated the tribe. The  Mundas and Santals were among the other important  tribes  that  lived  in  this  region  and  also  in  Orissa   and Bengal.   51  Clan A clan is a group  of families or  households  claiming descent  from a common  ancestor. Tribal  organisation is  often based on  kinship or clan  loyalties.

Kolis  also  lived  in  many  areas  of  Gujarat. Further south there were  large tribal populations of Koragas,  Vetars, Maravars and many others.  The  large  tribe  of  Bhils  was  spread across western and central  India.  By  the  late  sixteenth  c e n t u r y ,   m a n y   o f   t h e m   h a d  become  settled  agriculturists  and  some  even  zamindars.  Many  Bhil  clans,  nevertheless,  remained   hunter-gatherers. The Gonds were  found in great numbers across the  present-day states of Chhattisgarh,  Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and  Andhra Pradesh.   How Nomads and  mobile People lived Nomadic  pastoralists  moved  over  long  distances  with  their  animals.  They  lived  on  milk  and  other pastoral products. They also  exchanged  wool,  ghee,  etc.,  with  settled  agriculturists  for  grain,  cloth, utensils and other products.   Fig. 2 Bhils hunting deer by night.  Fig.3 A chain of mobile traders connected  India to the outside world. Here you see  nuts being gathered and loaded on the  backs of camels. Central Asian traders  brought such goods to India and the  Banjaras and other traders carried  these to local markets.  52  Unit 5 to 7.indd   52  17-05-2022   12:16:17  our pasts – iiRationalised 2023-24Nomads and  itinerant groups Nomads are  wandering people.  Many of them  are pastoralists  who roam from  one pasture to  another with their  flocks and herds.  Similarly, itinerant  groups, such as  craftspersons,  pedlars and  entertainers travel  from place to  place practising  their different  occupations.  Both nomads and  itinerant groups  often visit the  same places every  year.   They  bought  and  sold  these  goods  as  they  moved  from one place to another, transporting them on their  animals.  The  Banjaras  were  the  most  important  trader- nomads.  Their  caravan  was  called  tanda.  Sultan  Alauddin  Khalji  (Chapter  3)  used  the  Banjaras  to  transport grain to the city markets. Emperor Jahangir  wrote in his memoirs that the Banjaras carried grain  on  their  bullocks  from  different  areas  and  sold  it  in  towns.  They  transported  food  grain  for  the  Mughal  army  during  military  campaigns.  With  a  large  army  there could be 100,000 bullocks carrying grain.  The Banjaras  Peter  Mundy,  an  English  trader  who  came  to  India  during  the  early  seventeenth  century,  has  described  the Banjaras:   In the morning we met a tanda of Banjaras with 14,000  oxen.  They  were  all  laden  with  grains  such  as  wheat  and  rice  ...  These  Banjaras  carry  their  household  –  wives  and  children  –  along  with  them.  One  tanda  consists  of  many  families. Their way of life is similar to that of carriers who  continuously travel from place to place. They own their oxen.  They are sometimes hired by merchants, but most commonly  they are themselves merchants. They buy grain where it is  cheaply available and carry it to places where it is dearer.  From there, they again reload their oxen with anything that  can be profitably sold in other places … In a tanda there may  be as many as 6 or 7 hundred persons … They do not travel  more than 6 or 7 miles a day – that, too, in the cool weather.  After unloading their oxen, they turn them free to graze as  there is enough land here, and no one there to forbid them. ?  Find  out  how  grain  is  transported  from  villages  to cities at present. In what ways is this similar  to  or  different  from  the  ways  in  which  the    Banjaras functioned?   53  Unit 5 to 7.indd   53  17-05-2022   12:16:18  tribes, nomads andsettled communitiesRationalised 2023-24  Fig. 4 Bronze crocodile,  Kutiya Kond tribe,  Orissa.  Many  pastoral  tribes  reared  and  sold  animals,  such as cattle and horses, to the prosperous people.  Different  castes  of  petty  pedlars  also  travelled  from  village  to  village.  They  made  and  sold wares such as ropes,  reeds, straw matting and  coarse sacks. Sometimes  m e n d i c a n t s   a c t e d   a s  wandering merchants. There  were castes of entertainers who performed in different  towns and villages for their livelihood.   Changing Society: New Castes and  Hierarchies  As the economy and the needs of society grew, people  with  new  skills  were  required.  Smaller  castes,  or  jatis, emerged within varnas. For example, new castes  appeared  amongst  the  Brahmanas.  On  the  other   hand,  many  tribes  and  social  groups  were  taken  into  caste-based  society  and  given  the  status  of  jatis.  Specialised  artisans  –  smiths,  carpenters  and  masons  –  were  also  recognised  as  separate  jatis  by  the Brahmanas.

They deliberated on the status of a group known as  rathakaras (literally, chariot makers). They laid down  their occupations, which were to include architecture,  building  coaches  and  chariots,  erecting  gateways  for  temples  with  images  in  them,  preparing  wooden  equipment  used  to  perform  sacrifices,  building  mandapas, making jewels for the king.   54  Unit 5 to 7.indd   54  17-05-2022   12:16:19  our pasts – iiRationalised 2023-24Among  the  Kshatriyas,  new  Rajput  clans  became  powerful  by  the  eleventh  and  twelfth  centuries.  They belonged to different lineages, such as Hunas,  Chandelas, Chalukyas and others. Some of these, too,  had been tribes earlier. Many of these clans came to  be regarded as Rajputs. They gradually replaced the  older  rulers,  especially  in  agricultural  areas.  Here  a  developed society was emerging, and rulers used their  wealth to create powerful states.   The rise of Rajput clans to the position of rulers set  an example for the tribal people to follow. Gradually,  with  the  support  of  the  Brahmanas,  many  tribes  became a part of the caste system. But only the leading  tribal  families  could  join  the  ruling  class.  A  large  majority joined the lower jatis of caste society. On the  other hand, many dominant tribes of Punjab, Sind and  the North-West Frontier had adopted Islam quite early.  They continued to reject the caste system. The unequal  social  order,  prescribed  by  orthodox  Hinduism,  was  not widely accepted in these areas.   The emergence of states is closely related to social  change amongst tribal people. Two examples of this  important part of our history are described below.  Fig. 5 A Gond woman.  a Closer look  The Gonds  The  Gonds  lived  in  a  vast  forested  region  called  Gondwana  –  or  “country  inhabited  by  Gonds”.  They  practised shifting cultivation. The large Gond tribe  was further divided into many smaller clans. Each clan  had its own raja or rai. About the time that the power  of the Delhi Sultans was declining, a few large Gond  kingdoms  were  beginning  to  dominate  the  smaller  Gond  chiefs.  The  Akbar  Nama,  a  history  of  Akbar’s  reign, mentions the Gond kingdom of Garha Katanga  that had 70,000 villages.   The administrative system of these kingdoms was  becoming centralised. The kingdom was divided into   55  Shifting  cultivation Trees and bushes  in a forest area  are first cut and  burnt. The crop  is sown in the  ashes.

This  was further divided into units of  84 villages called chaurasi. The  chaurasi  was  subdivided  into  barhots which were made up of  12 villages each.  The emergence of large states  changed  the  nature  of  Gond  society.  Their  basically  equal  society  gradually  got  divided                   into  unequal  social  classes.  Brahmanas received land grants  from the Gond rajas and became  more influential. The Gond chiefs  now  wished  to  be  recognised  as  Rajputs.  So,  Aman  Das,  the  Gond  raja  of  Garha  Katanga,  assumed  the  title  of  Sangram  Shah. His son, Dalpat, married   princess Durgawati, the daughter  of  Salbahan,  the  Chandel  Rajput raja of Mahoba.   Dalpat,  however,  died  early.  Rani  Durgawati            was  very  capable,  and  started  ruling  on  behalf            of  her  five-year-old  son,             Bir  Narain.  Under  her,  the  kingdom  became  even  more  extensive.  In  1565, the Mughal forces  under Asaf Khan attacked  Garha Katanga. A strong  resistance was put up by  Rani Durgawati.  She was  defeated and preferred to  die rather than surrender.  Her son, too, died fighting  soon after.   56  Map 2 Gondwana.  Fig. 6 A carved door.  Gond tribe, Bastar  area, Madhya  Pradesh.

Garha  Katanga  was  a  rich  state.  It  earned  much  wealth by trapping and exporting wild elephants to other  kingdoms. When the Mughals defeated the Gonds, they  captured a huge booty of precious coins and elephants.  They annexed part of the kingdom and granted the rest  to Chandra Shah, an uncle of Bir Narain. Despite the  fall of Garha Katanga, the Gond kingdoms survived for  some time. However, they became much weaker and  later  struggled  unsuccessfully  against  the  stronger  Bundelas and Marathas.   The Ahoms  The Ahoms migrated to the Brahmaputra valley from  present-day  Myanmar  in  the  thirteenth  century.  They  created  a  new  state  by  suppressing  the  older  political system of the bhuiyans (landlords). During  the sixteenth century, they annexed the kingdoms of  the  Chhutiyas  (1523)  and  of  Koch-Hajo  (1581)  and  subjugated  many  other  tribes.  The  Ahoms  built  a  large state, and for this they used firearms as early as  the 1530s. By the 1660s they could even make high-  quality gunpowder and cannons.  However, the Ahoms faced many invasions from the  south-west.  In  1662,  the  Mughals  under  Mir  Jumla  attacked  the  Ahom  kingdom.  Despite  their  brave  defence, the Ahoms were defeated.  But direct Mughal control over the  region could not last long.   The Ahom state depended upon  forced labour. Those forced to work  for  the  state  were  called  paiks.  A  census  of  the  population  was  taken. Each village had to send a  number of paiks by rotation. People  from heavily populated areas were  shifted  to  less  populated  places.  Ahom clans were thus broken up.  By the first half of the seventeenth  century the administration became  quite centralised.  57  Unit 5 to 7.indd   57  17-05-2022   12:16:21  tribes, nomads andsettled communitiesRationalised 2023-24Fig. 7 Ear ornaments, Koboi  Naga tribe, Manipur.  ?  Why do you think  the Mughals  tried to conquer  the land of the  Ahoms?   Almost all adult males served in the army during  war.  At  other  times,  they  were  engaged  in  building  dams, irrigation systems and other public works. The  Ahoms also introduced new methods of rice cultivation.  Ahom society was divided into clans or khels. There  were  very  few  castes  of  artisans,  so  artisans  in  the  Ahom areas came from the adjoining kingdoms. A khel  often controlled several villages. The peasant was given  land by his village community. Even the king could not  take it away without the community’s consent.  Originally, the Ahoms worshipped their own tribal  gods. During the first half of the seventeenth century,  however,  the  influence  of  Brahmanas  increased.  Temples  and  Brahmanas  were  granted  land  by  the  king. In the reign of Sib Singh (1714 –1744), Hinduism  became the predominant religion.  But the Ahom kings  did not completely give up their traditional beliefs after  adopting Hinduism.  Ahom  society  was  very  sophisticated.  Poets  and  scholars  were  given  land  grants.  Theatre  was  encouraged.  Important  works  of  Sanskrit  were  translated  into  the  local  language.  Historical  works,  known as buranjis, were also written – first in the Ahom  language and then in Assamese.  Conclusion  Considerable social change took place in the subcontinent  during the period we have been examining. Varna-based  society and tribal people constantly interacted with each  other. This interaction caused both kinds of societies  to adapt and change. There were many different tribes  and they took up diverse livelihoods. Over a period of  time, many of them merged with caste-based society.  Others, however, rejected both the caste system and  orthodox Hinduism. Some tribes established extensive  states with well-organised systems of administration.  They thus became politically powerful. This brought  them  into  conflict  with  larger  and  more  complex  kingdoms and empires.  58  Unit 5 to 7.indd   58  17-05-2022   12:16:21  our pasts – iiRationalised 2023-24 Imagine  You  are  a  member  of  a  nomadic  community that shifts residence every  three months.

19,19,0,"6 devoTIonal paThS   To The dIvIne  You  may  have  seen  people  perform  rituals  of    worship, or singing bhajans, kirtans or qawwalis,  or  even  repeating  the  name  of  God  in  silence,  and  noticed that some of them are moved to tears. Such  intense devotion or love of God is the legacy of various  kinds of bhakti and Sufi movements that have evolved  since the eighth century.  The Idea of a Supreme God  Before  large  kingdoms  emerged,  different  groups                 of people worshipped their own gods and goddesses.  As people were brought together through the growth  of  towns,  trade  and  empires,  new  ideas  began  to  develop. The idea that all living things pass through  countless cycles of birth and rebirth performing good  deeds and bad came to be widely accepted. Similarly,  the idea that all human beings are not equal even at  birth gained ground during this period. The belief that  social privileges came from birth in a “noble” family or  a “high” caste was the subject of many learned texts.  Many  people  were  uneasy  with  such  ideas  and  turned to the teachings of the Buddha or the Jainas  according to which it was possible to overcome social  differences  and  break  the  cycle  of  rebirth  through  personal effort. Others felt attracted to the idea of a  Supreme God who could deliver humans from such  bondage  if  approached  with  devotion  (or  bhakti).  This  idea,  advocated  in  the  Bhagavadgita,  grew  in  popularity in the early centuries of the Common Era.    61  The beginning of  Bhakti Worship of certain  deities, which  became a central  feature of later  Hinduism, gained in  importance. These  deities included  Shiva, Vishnu, and  goddesses such as  Durga. These deities  were worshipped  through Bhakti, an  idea that became  very popular at  this time. Bhakti is  generally understood  as a person’s  devotion to his or  her chosen deity.  Anybody, whether  rich or poor, belonging  to the so-called ‘high’  or ‘low’ castes, man  or woman, could  follow the path of  Bhakti. The idea of  Bhakti is present in  the Bhagavad Gita, a  sacred book of   the Hindus.

You can observe  this process of  local myths and  legends receiving  wider acceptance  even today. Can  you find some  examples  around you?   Shiva, Vishnu and  Durga as supreme  deities  came  to             b e   w o r s h i p p e d  through  elaborate  r i t u a l s .   A t   t h e  same  time,  gods  a n d   g o d d e s s e s  w o r s h i p p e d   i n  d i f f e r e n t   a r e a s  t o   b e  c a m e   i d e n t i f i e d   w i t h  S h i v a ,   V i s h n u  or  Durga.  In  the  process, local myths and legends became a part of the  Puranic stories, and methods of worship recommended  in the Puranas were introduced into the local cults.  Eventually  the  Puranas  also  laid  down  that  it  was  possible  for  devotees  to  receive  the  grace  of  God  regardless  of  their  caste  status.  The  idea  of  bhakti  became  so  popular  that  even  Buddhists  and  Jainas  adopted these beliefs.  a New Kind of Bhakti in South india –  Nayanars and alvars  The seventh to ninth centuries saw the emergence of  new religious movements, led by the Nayanars (saints  devoted to Shiva) and Alvars (saints devoted to Vishnu)  who came from all castes including those considered  “untouchable” like the Pulaiyar and the Panars. They  were  sharply  critical  of  the  Buddhists  and  Jainas  and preached ardent love of Shiva or Vishnu as the  path to salvation. They drew upon the ideals of love  and heroism as found in the Sangam literature (the  earliest example of Tamil literature, composed during  the early centuries of the Common Era) and blended  them  with  the  values  of  bhakti.  The  Nayanars  and  Alvars went from place to place composing exquisite  poems in praise of the deities enshrined in the villages  they visited, and set them to music.  62  Unit 5 to 7.indd   62  17-05-2022   12:16:23  our pasts – iiRationalised 2023-24Hagiography  Writing of saints’  lives.  Fig. 2 A bronze image of  Manikkavasagar.  Nayanars and alvars  There  were  63  Nayanars,  who  belonged  to  different  caste  backgrounds,  such  as  potters,  “untouchable”  workers,  peasants,  hunters,  soldiers,  Brahmanas  and  chiefs.  The  best  known  among  them  were  Appar,  Sambandar, Sundarar and Manikkavasagar. There are  two sets of compilations of their songs – Tevaram and  Tiruvacakam.   There  were  12  Alvars,  who  came  from  equally   divergent  backgrounds,  the  best  known  being  Periyalvar,  his  daughter  Andal,  Tondaradippodi  Alvar  and Nammalvar. Their songs were compiled in the Divya  Prabandham.  Between the tenth and twelfth centuries, the Chola  and Pandya kings built elaborate temples around many  of the shrines visited by the saint-poets, strengthening  the  links  between  the  bhakti  tradition  and  temple  worship.  This  was  also  the  time  when  their  poems  were  compiled.  Besides,  hagiographies  or  religious  biographies  of  the  Alvars  and  Nayanars  were  also  composed.  Today  we  use  these  texts  as  sources  for  writing histories of the bhakti tradition.

Try and find out  more about the  ideas of Shankara  or Ramanuja.  Philosophy and Bhakti   Shankara, one of the most influential philosophers  of India, was born in Kerala in the eighth century.  He  was  an  advocate  of  Advaita  or  the  doctrine  of  the oneness of the individual soul and the Supreme  God  which  is  the  Ultimate  Reality.  He  taught  that  Brahman, the only or Ultimate Reality, was formless  and without any attributes. He considered the world  around  us  to  be  an  illusion  or  maya,  and  preached  renunciation of the world and adoption of the path of  knowledge to understand the true nature of Brahman  and attain salvation.    Ramanuja,  born  in  Tamil  Nadu  in  the  eleventh  century,  was  deeply  influenced  by  the  Alvars.  According  to  him  the  best  means  of  attaining  salvation was through intense devotion to Vishnu.  Vishnu  in  His  grace  helps  the  devotee  to  attain  the  bliss of union with Him. He propounded the doctrine  of Vishishtadvaita or qualified oneness in that the soul  even  when  united  with  the  Supreme  God  remained  distinct.  Ramanuja’s  doctrine  greatly  inspired  the  new  strand  of  bhakti  which  developed  in  north   India subsequently.    Basavanna’s virashaivism  We noted earlier the connection between the Tamil  bhakti movement and temple worship. This in turn  led  to  a  reaction  that  is  best  represented  in  the  Virashaiva movement initiated by Basavanna and his  companions like Allama Prabhu and Akkamahadevi.  T h i s   m o v e m e n t   b e g a n   i n   K a r n a t a k a   i n   t h e   mid-twelfth century. The Virashaivas argued strongly  for  the  equality  of  all  human  beings  and  against  Brahmanical ideas about caste and the treatment of  women. They were also against all forms of ritual and  idol worship.   64  Unit 5 to 7.indd   64  17-05-2022   12:16:24  our pasts – iiRationalised 2023-24Virashaiva vachanas  These are vachanas or sayings attributed to Basavanna:  The rich, Will make temples for Shiva. What shall I,  A poor man, Do?  My legs are pillars, The body the shrine, The head a cupola Of gold.  Listen, O Lord of the meeting rivers, Things standing shall fall, But the moving ever shall stay. ?  What is the temple that Basavanna is offering to God?  Bhakti movement in the decean From  the  thirteenth  to  the  seventeenth  centuries,  Maharashtra saw a great number of saint-poets, whose  songs  in  simple  Marathi  continue  to  inspire  people.  The most important among them were Dnyaneshwar  (Gyaneshwar), Namdev, Eknath and Tukaram as well  as women like Sakhubai and the family of Chokhamela,  who belonged to the “untouchable” Mahar caste. This  regional tradition of bhakti focused on the Vitthala (a  form of Vishnu) temple in Pandharpur, as well as on  the notion of a personal god residing in the hearts of  all people.   These  saint-poets  rejected  all  forms  of  ritualism,  outward  display  of  piety  and  social  differences  based on birth. In fact, they even rejected the idea of  renunciation and preferred to live with their families,  earning  their  livelihood  like  any  other  person,  while  humbly serving fellow human beings in need. A new  humanist idea emerged as they insisted that bhakti  65  The Vaishnava  poet-saints of  Maharashtra, such  as Jnaneshwar,  Namadeva,  Eknath and  Tukaram were  devotees of lord  Vitthala. Devotion  around lord  Vitthala gave rise  to the Varkari  sect which lay  emphasis on an  annual pilgrimage  to Pandharpur.  The cult of Vitthala  emerged as a  powerful mode  of devotion and  was very popular  amongst the  people.

As  the  famous  Gujarati  saint  Narsi  Mehta  said,  “They  are  Vaishnavas  who  understand the pain of others.”  Questioning the social order  This  is  an  abhang  (Marathi  devotional  hymn)  of  Sant  Tukaram:   He who identifies  with the battered and the beaten Mark him as a saint For God is with him  He holds Every forsaken man Close to his heart  He treats  A slave As his own son  Says Tuka I won’t be tired  to repeat again Such a man Is God  In person.  Here is an abhang composed by Chokhamela’s son:  You made us low caste, Why don’t you face that fact, Great Lord? Our whole life – left-over food to eat. You should be ashamed of this.  You have eaten in our home. How can you deny it? Chokha’s (son) Karmamela asks Why did you give me life? ?  Discuss the ideas about the social order expressed  in these compositions.   66  Unit 5 to 7.indd   66  17-05-2022   12:16:25  our pasts – iiRationalised 2023-24Nathpanthis, Siddhas and Yogis  A  number  of  religious  groups  that  emerged during this period criticised the  ritual and other aspects of conventional  religion  and  the  social  order,  using  simple, logical arguments. Among them  were  the  Nathpanthis,  Siddhacharas  and Yogis. They advocated renunciation  of  the  world.  To  them  the  path  to  salvation  lay  in  meditation  on  the  formless  Ultimate  Reality  and  the  realisation of oneness with it. To achieve  this, they advocated intense training of  the mind and body through practices  like  yogasanas,  breathing  exercises  and meditation. These groups became  particularly popular among “low” castes.  Their criticism of conventional religion  created  the  ground  for  devotional  religion  to  become  a  popular  force  in  northern India.  islam and Sufism The  sants  had  much  in  common  with  the  Sufis,  so  much  so  that  it  is  believed  that  they  adopted  many  ideas of each other. Sufis were Muslim mystics. They  rejected outward religiosity and emphasised love and  devotion  to  God  and  compassion  towards  all  fellow  human beings.   Islam propagated strict monotheism or submission  to one God. In the eighth and ninth centuries, religious  scholars developed different aspects of the Holy Law  (Shariat) and theology of Islam. While the religion of  Islam gradually became more complex, Sufis provided  it with an additional dimension that favoured a more  personal devotion to God. The Sufis often rejected the  elaborate rituals and codes of behaviour demanded by  Muslim religious scholars. They sought union with God  much as a lover seeks his beloved with a disregard for   67  Fig. 3 A fireside gathering of  ascetics.

Like the saint-poets, the Sufis too composed  poems expressing their feelings, and a rich literature  in  prose,  including  anecdotes  and  fables,  developed  around them. Among the great Sufis of Central Asia  were Ghazzali, Rumi and Sadi. Like the Nathpanthis,  Siddhas and Yogis, the Sufis too believed that the heart  can be trained to look at the world in a different way.  They developed elaborate methods of training using zikr  (chanting of a name or sacred formula), contemplation,  sama (singing), raqs (dancing), discussion of parables,  breath control, etc., under the guidance of a master or  pir. Thus emerged the silsilas, a spiritual genealogy of  Sufi teachers, each following a slightly different method  (tariqa) of instruction and ritual practice.   Fig. 4 Mystics in ecstasy.  In Kashmir, the  Rishi order of  Sufism flourished  in the 15th and  16th centuries.  This order was  established by  Sheikh Nuruddin  Wali also known  as Nund Rishi and  had a deep impact  on the life of the  people in Kashmir.  A number of  shrines dedicated  to  Rishi saints can  be found in many  parts of Kashmir.   68  Unit 5 to 7.indd   68  17-05-2022   12:16:30  our pasts – iiRationalised 2023-24A  large  number  of  Sufis                 from  Central  Asia  settled  in  Hindustan  from  the  eleventh  century  onwards.

Here is an excerpt from  his work:  He was not on the Cross of the Christians. I went to the Hindu  temples. In none of them was there any sign. He was not on  the heights or in the lowlands … I went to the Kaaba of  Mecca. He was not there. I asked about him from Avicenna  the philosopher. He was beyond the range of Avicenna … I  looked into my heart. In that, his place, I saw him. He was  in no other place.

New religious developments in   North india  The  period  after  the  thirteenth  century  saw  a  new  wave  of  the  bhakti  movement  in  North  India.  This  was  an  age  when  Islam,  Brahmanical  Hinduism,  Sufism,  various  strands  of  bhakti,  and  the  Nathpanths,  Siddhas  and  Yogis  influenced  one  another.  We  saw  that  new  kingdoms  (Chapters  2,  3   and 4) were emerging, and people were taking up new  professions and finding new roles for themselves. Such  people, especially craftspersons, peasants, traders and  labourers, thronged to listen to these  new saints and spread their ideas.  Some of them like Kabir and Baba  Guru  Nanak  rejected  all  orthodox  religions.  Others  like  Tulsidas  and  Surdas  accepted  existing  beliefs            and  practices  but  wanted  to  make  these  accessible  to  all.  Tulsidas  conceived  of  God  in  the  form  of  Rama.  Tulsidas’s  composition,  the  Ramcharitmanas, written in Awadhi  (a  language  used  in  eastern  Uttar  Pradesh),  is  important  both  as  an   70  Unit 5 to 7.indd   70  17-05-2022   12:16:32  our pasts – iiRationalised 2023-24Map 1 Major bhakti saints  and the regions  associated with them.  The essence of  Shankaradeva’s   devotion came to  be known as Eka  Sarana Nama  Dharma (supreme  surrender to  the One). The  teachings of  Shankaradeva  were based on the  Bhagavad Gita  and Bhagavata  Purana. He also  encouraged the  establishment  of satra or  monasteries for  transmission of  knowledge. His  major compositions  included   Kirtana-ghosha.  expression of his devotion and as a literary work. Surdas  was an ardent devotee of Krishna. His compositions,  compiled in the Sursagara, Surasaravali and Sahitya  Lahari, express his devotion. Also contemporary was  Shankaradeva  of  Assam  (late  fifteenth  century)  who  emphasised devotion to Vishnu, and composed poems  and plays in Assamese. He began the practice of setting  up  namghars  or  houses  of  recitation  and  prayer,  a  practice that continues to date.  This tradition also included saints like Dadu Dayal,  Ravidas and Mirabai. Mirabai was a Rajput princess  married into the royal family of Mewar in the sixteenth  century. Mirabai became a disciple of Ravidas, a saint  from  a  caste  considered  “untouchable”.  She  was   71  Unit 5 to 7.indd   71  17-05-2022   12:16:33  devotional paths to the divineRationalised 2023-24devoted  to  Krishna  and  composed  innumerable  bhajans  expressing  her  intense  devotion.  Her  songs  also openly challenged the norms of the “upper” castes  and  became  popular  with  the  masses  in  Rajasthan  and Gujarat.  A unique feature of most of the saints is that their  works were composed in regional languages and could  be  sung.  They  became  immensely  popular  and  were  handed  down  orally  from  generation  to  generation.  Usually the poorest, most deprived communities and  women transmitted these songs, often adding their own  experiences. Thus the songs as we have them today are  as much a creation of the saints as of generations of  people who sang them. They have become a part of our  living popular culture.   An important  contribution of  Bhakti saints  was towards the  development of  music. Jayadeva of  Bengal composed  the Gita Govinda  in Sanskrit, each  song composed  in a particular  raga and tala. A  significant impact  that these saints  had on music was  the use of bhajan,  kirtan and abhang.  These songs which  emphasised on  emotional experience  had a tremendous  appeal to the  common people.  Beyond the rana’s palace  This is a song composed by Mirabai:   Ranaji, I have left your norms of shame, and false decorum of the princely life. I have left your town. And yet Rana why have you kept up                              enmity against me? Rana you gave me a cup of poison. I drank it laughing.  Rana I will not be destroyed by you. And yet Rana why have you kept up                                     enmity against me? ?  Why do you think Mirabai left the                            Rana’s palace?

He  was brought up in a family of Muslim julahas or weavers  settled in or near the city of Benares (Varanasi). We  have little reliable information about his life. We get  to know of his ideas from a vast collection of verses  called sakhis and pads said to have been composed  by him and sung by wandering bhajan singers. Some  of these were later collected and preserved in the Guru  Granth Sahib, Panch Vani and Bijak.  in search of the True lord  Here is a composition of Kabir:   O Allah-Ram present in all living beings Have mercy on your servants, O Lord!  Why bump your head on the ground, Why bathe your body in water? You kill and you call yourself “humble” But your vices you conceal.  Twenty-four times the Brahmana keeps  the ekadasi fast While the Qazi observes the Ramzan Tell me why does he set aside the eleven  months  To seek spiritual fruit in the twelfth?  Hari dwells in the East, they say And Allah resides in the West, Search for him in your heart, in the heart  of your heart; There he dwells, Rahim-Ram.

Kabir’s teachings were based on a complete, indeed  vehement, rejection of the major religious traditions.  His teachings openly ridiculed all forms of external  worship of both Brahmanical Hinduism and Islam,  the pre-eminence of the priestly classes and the caste  system.  The  language  of  his  poetry  was  a  form  of  spoken Hindi widely understood by ordinary people.  He also sometimes used cryptic language, which is  difficult to follow.  Kabir  believed  in  a  formless  Supreme  God  and  preached that the only path to salvation was through  bhakti  or  devotion.  Kabir  drew  his  followers  from  among both Hindus and Muslims.  a Closer look: Baba Guru Nanak  We  know  more  about  Baba  Guru  Nanak  (1469-1539)  than  about  Kabir.  Born  at  Talwandi  (Nankana  Sahib  in  Pakistan),  he  travelled  widely  before  establishing  a  centre at Kartarpur (Dera Baba Nanak on the river Ravi).  A regular worship that consisted of the singing of his  own  hymns  was  established  there  for  his  followers.  Irrespective  of  their  former  creed,  caste  or  gender,  his  followers  ate  together  in  the  common kitchen (langar). The  sacred space thus created by  Baba Guru Nanak was known  as dharmsal. It is now known  as Gurdwara.   Before  his  death  in  1539,  Baba Guru Nanak appointed  one  of  his  followers  as  his  successor. His name was Lehna  but he came to be known as  Guru  Angad,  signifying  that   he was a part of Baba Guru  Nanak  himself.  Guru  Angad  compiled  the  compositions   of  Baba  Guru  Nanak,  to   which  he  added  his  own  in    74  Unit 5 to 7.indd   74  17-05-2022   12:16:35  our pasts – iiRationalised 2023-24Fig. 11 An early manuscript  of the Guru Granth  Sahib.  a  new  script  known  as  Gurmukhi.  The  three  successors  of  Guru  Angad  also wrote under the name of “Nanak”  and  all  of  their  compositions  were  compiled by Guru Arjan in 1604. To this  compilation were added the writings of  other  figures  like  Shaikh  Farid,  Sant  Kabir, Bhagat Namdev and Guru Tegh  Bahadur. In 1706, this compilation was  authenticated by Guru Tegh Bahadur’s  son and successor, Guru Gobind Singh.  It is now known as Guru Granth Sahib,  the holy scripture of the Sikhs.  The number of Baba Guru Nanak’s   followers  increased  through  the  sixteenth  century  under  his  successors.  They  belonged  to  a  number  of  castes  but  traders,  agriculturists,  artisans  and  craftsmen  predominated.  This  may  have  something  to  do  with  Baba  Guru  Nanak’s  insistence  that  his  followers  must  be  householders  and  should  adopt  productive  and  useful  occupations.  They  were  also  expected  to  contribute  to  the  general  funds  of  the  community of followers.   By  the  beginning  of  the  seventeenth  century,  the  town of Ramdaspur (Amritsar) had developed around  the central Gurdwara called Harmandar Sahib (Golden  Temple).  It  was  virtually  self-governing  and  modern  historians refer to the early-seventeenth-century Sikh  community as ‘a state within the state’. The Mughal  emperor  Jahangir  looked  upon  them  as  a  potential  threat  and  he  ordered  the  execution  of  Guru  Arjan  in 1606.  The Sikh movement began to get politicised  in  the  seventeenth  century,  a  development  which  culminated in the institution of the Khalsa by Guru  Gobind Singh in 1699. The community of the Sikhs,  called the Khalsa Panth, became a political entity.   The  changing  historical  situation  during  the  sixteenth  and  seventeenth  centuries  influenced  the  development  of  the  Sikh  movement.  The  ideas   75  Unit 5 to 7.indd   75  17-05-2022   12:16:36  devotional paths to the divineRationalised 2023-24of  Baba  Guru  Nanak  had  a  huge  impact  on  this  development from the very beginning. He emphasised  the importance of the worship of one God. He insisted  that caste, creed or gender was irrelevant for attaining  liberation. His idea of liberation was not that of a state  of inert bliss but rather the pursuit of active life with  a strong sense of social commitment. He himself used  the terms nam, dan and isnan for the essence of his  teaching, which actually meant right worship, welfare  of  others  and  purity  of  conduct.  His  teachings  are  now remembered as nam-japna, kirt-karna and vand- chhakna, which also underline the importance of right  belief and worship, honest living, and helping others.  Thus, Baba Guru Nanak’s idea of equality had social  and political implications. This might partly explain  the difference between the history of the followers of  Baba Guru Nanak and the history of the followers of  the other religious figures of the medieval centuries,  like Kabir, Ravidas and Dadu, whose ideas were very  similar to those of Baba Guru Nanak.

20,20,0,"7  the MAKING OF  ReGIONAL CULtUReS  One  of  the  commonest  ways  of  describing  people    is in terms of the language they speak. When we  refer to a person as a Tamil or an Oriya, this usually  means that he or she speaks Tamil or Oriya and lives  in  Tamil  Nadu  or  Orissa.  We  also  tend  to  associate  each  region  with  distinctive  kinds  of  food,  clothes,  poetry, dance, music and painting. Sometimes we take  these identities for granted and assume that they have  existed from time immemorial. However, the frontiers  separating  regions  have  evolved  over  time  (and  in  fact  are  still  changing).  Also,  what  we  understand  as  regional  cultures  today  are  often  the  product  of  complex  processes  of  intermixing  of  local  traditions  with  ideas  from  other  parts  of  the  subcontinent.  As  we will see, some traditions appear specific to some  regions, others seem to be similar across regions, and  yet others derive from older practices in a particular  area, but take a new form in other regions.   the Cheras and the Development                of Malayalam   Let  us  begin  by  looking  at  an  example  of  the  connection between language and region. The Chera  kingdom  of  Mahodayapuram  was  established  in  the  ninth  century  in  the  south-western  part  of  the  peninsula, part of the present-day Kerala. It is likely  that Malayalam was spoken in this area. The rulers  introduced the Malayalam language and script in their  inscriptions. In fact, this is one of the earliest examples  of the use of a regional language in official records in   the subcontinent.   79  ?

Find out when the  language(s) you  speak at home  were first used  for writing.     Fig. 2 The icons of  Balabhadra,  Subhadra and  Jagannatha, palm-leaf  manuscript, Orissa.  At  the  same  time,  the  Cheras  also  drew  upon  Sanskritic  traditions.  The  temple  theatre  of  Kerala,  which  is  traced  to  this  period,  borrowed  stories  from  the  Sanskrit  epics.  The  first  literary  works  in  Malayalam,  dated  to  about  the  twelfth  century,  are  directly indebted to Sanskrit.  Interestingly enough, a  fourteenth-century text, the Lilatilakam, dealing with  grammar and poetics, was composed in Manipravalam  – literally, “diamonds and corals” referring to the two  languages, Sanskrit and the regional language.     rulers and religious Traditions:               The Jagannatha Cult  In  other  regions,  regional  cultures  grew  around  religious  traditions.  The  best  example  of  this  process is the cult of Jagannatha (literally, lord of  the world, a name for Vishnu) at Puri, Orissa. To  date,  the  local  tribal  people  make  the wooden image of the deity, which  suggests that the deity was originally  a local god, who was later identified  with Vishnu.  In  the  twelfth  century,  one  of  the  most  important  rulers  of  the  Ganga  dynasty,  Anantavarman,  decided  to  erect  a  temple  for  Purushottama  Jagannatha at Puri. Subsequently, in  1230, king Anangabhima III dedicated  his kingdom to the deity and proclaimed  himself as the “deputy” of the god.  80  Unit 5 to 7.indd   80  17-05-2022   12:16:39  our pasts – iiRationalised 2023-24As  the  temple  gained  in  importance  as  a  centre  of  pilgrimage,  its  authority  in  social  and  political  matters  also  increased.  All  those  who  conquered  Orissa,  such  as  the  Mughals,  the  Marathas  and  the  English  East  India  Company,  attempted  to  gain  control over the temple. They felt  that this would make their rule  acceptable to the local people.    The rajputs and  Traditions of Heroism  Fig. 3 Jagannatha temple,  Puri.  Fig. 4 Prince Raj Singh of  Bikaner.  In the nineteenth century, the  region  that  constitutes  most  of  present-day  Rajasthan,  was called Rajputana by the British. While this may  suggest  that  this  was  an  area  that  was  inhabited  only  or  mainly  by  Rajputs,  this  is  only  partly  true.  There  were  (and  are)  several  groups  who  identify  themselves  as  Rajputs  in  many  areas  of  northern  and  central  India.  And  of  course,  there  are  several  peoples  other  than  Rajputs  who  live  in  Rajasthan.  However,  the  Rajputs  are  often  recognised  as  contributing  to  the  distinctive   culture of Rajasthan.   These cultural traditions were closely linked  with  the  ideals  and  aspirations  of  rulers.  From about the eighth century, most of the  present-day state of Rajasthan was ruled by  various Rajput families. Prithviraj (Chapter 2)  was one such ruler. These rulers cherished  the  ideal  of  the  hero  who  fought  valiantly,  often choosing death on the battlefield rather  than face defeat. Stories about Rajput heroes  were  recorded  in  poems  and  songs,  which  were  recited  by  specially  trained  minstrels.   81  Unit 5 to 7.indd   81  17-05-2022   12:16:42  the making of  regional culturesRationalised 2023-24These preserved the memories of heroes and were  expected to inspire others to follow their example.  Ordinary people were also attracted by these stories  –  which  often  depicted  dramatic  situations,  and  a  range of strong emotions – loyalty, friendship, love,  valour, anger, etc.   Did  women  find  a  place  within  these  stories?  Sometimes  women  are  depicted  as  following  their  heroic  husbands  in  both  life  and  death  –  there  are  stories  about  the  practice  of  sati  or  the  immolation  of widows on the funeral pyre of their husbands. So  those who followed the heroic ideal often had to pay  for it with their lives.   Map 1 Regions discussed in  this chapter.  82  Unit 5 to 7.indd   82  17-05-2022   12:16:43  our pasts – iiRationalised 2023-24?  Find out whether  there are  traditions of  heroes/heroines  in your town or  village. What  are the qualities  associated with  them? In what  ways are these  similar to or  different from the  heroic ideals of  the Rajputs?   Beyond regional Frontiers:                The Story of Kathak   If heroic traditions can be found in different regions in  different forms, the same is true of dance. Let us look at  the history of one dance form, Kathak, now associated  with  several  parts  of  north  India.  The  term  kathak  is  derived  from  katha,  a  word  used  in  Sanskrit  and  other languages for story. The kathaks were originally  a caste of story-tellers in temples of north India, who  embellished  their  performances  with  gestures  and  songs. Kathak began evolving into a distinct mode of  dance  in  the  fifteenth  and  sixteenth  centuries  with  the  spread  of  the  bhakti  movement.  The  legends  of  Radha-Krishna were enacted in folk plays called rasa  lila, which combined folk dance with the basic gestures  of the kathak story-tellers.  Under the Mughal emperors and their nobles, Kathak  was performed in the court, where it acquired its present  features  and  developed  into  a  form  of  dance  with  a  distinctive  style.  Subsequently,  it  developed  in  two  traditions or gharanas: one in the courts of Rajasthan  (Jaipur) and the other in Lucknow. Under the patronage  of Wajid Ali Shah, the last Nawab of Awadh, it grew into  a major art form. By the third quarter of the nineteenth  century, it was firmly entrenched as a dance form not  only in these two regions, but in the adjoining areas of  present-day Punjab, Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir,   Fig. 5 Dance class,  Lakshmana temple,  Khajuraho.  83  Unit 5 to 7.indd   83  17-05-2022   12:16:44  the making of  regional culturesRationalised 2023-24Bihar  and  Madhya  Pradesh.  Emphasis  was  laid  on  intricate and rapid footwork, elaborate costumes, as  well as on the enactment of stories.   Kathak,  like  several  other  cultural  practices,  was  viewed with disfavour by most British administrators  in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. However, it  survived and continued to be performed by courtesans,  and was recognised as one of the six “classical” forms  of dance in the country after independence.   “Classical” dances  The  question  of  defining  any  art  form  as  “classical”  is  often  quite  complicated.  Do  we  define  something  as  classical  if  it  deals  with  a  religious  theme?  Or  do  we consider it classical because it appears to  require a great deal of skill acquired through  long years of training? Or is it classical  because  it  is  performed  according  to  rules that are laid down, and variations  are  not  encouraged?  These  are  questions we need to think about.  It is worth remembering that many  dance  forms  that  are  classified  as “folk” also share several of the  characteristics considered typical  of “classical” forms. So, while the  use  of  the  term  “classical”  may  suggest  that  these  forms  are  superior, this need not always be  literally true.   Other  dance  forms  that  are  recognised as classical at present are: Bharatanatyam (Tamil Nadu) Kathakali (Kerala) Odissi (Odisha) Kuchipudi (Andhra Pradesh) Manipuri (Manipur)   Fig. 6 Kathak dancers, a court painting.  ?

Miniatures (as their very  name  suggests)  are  small-sized  paintings,  generally  done in water colour on cloth or paper. The earliest  miniatures were on palm leaves or wood. Some of the  most beautiful of these, found in western India, were  used to illustrate Jaina texts. The Mughal emperors  Akbar,  Jahangir  and  Shah  Jahan  patronised  highly  skilled painters who primarily illustrated manuscripts  containing historical accounts and poetry. These were  generally  painted  in  brilliant  colours  and  portrayed  court scenes, scenes of battle or hunting, and other  aspects of social life. They were often  exchanged as gifts and were viewed  only by an exclusive few – the emperor  and his close associates.  Fig. 7 Akbar resting  during a hunt,  Mughal miniature.  With  the  decline  of  the  Mughal  Empire,  many  painters  moved  out  to  the  courts  of  the  emerging  regional states (see also Chapter 8).  As  a  result  Mughal  artistic  tastes  influenced  the  regional  courts  of  the  Deccan  and  the  Rajput  courts  of  Rajasthan.  At  the  same  time,  they  retained  and  developed  their  distinctive  characteristics.  Portraits  of  rulers  and  court  scenes  came  to  be  painted,  following  the  Mughal  example.  Besides,  themes  from  mythology and poetry were depicted  at centres such as Mewar, Jodhpur,  Bundi, Kota and Kishangarh.

Fig. 9 Krishna, Radha and  her companion, Pahari  miniature, Kangra.  century, this region had developed a bold and intense  style  of  miniature  painting  called  Basohli.  The  most  popular  text  to  be  painted  here  was  Bhanudatta’s  Rasamanjari. Nadir Shah’s invasion and the conquest  of Delhi in 1739 resulted in the migration of Mughal  artists to the hills to escape the uncertainties of the  plains.  Here  they  found  ready  patrons  which  led  to  the founding of the Kangra school of painting. By the  mid-eighteenth century the Kangra artists developed  a  style  which  breathed  a  new  spirit  into  miniature  painting.  The  source  of  inspiration  was  the  Vaishnavite  traditions.  Soft  colours  including  cool  blues  and  greens,  and  a  lyrical  treatment  of  themes  distinguished  Kangra painting.             R e m e m b e r   t h a t  ordinary  women  and  men painted as well — on  pots, walls, floors, cloth —  works  of  art  that  have   86  Unit 5 to 7.indd   86  17-05-2022   12:16:51  our pasts – iiRationalised 2023-24occasionally survived, unlike the miniatures that were  carefully preserved in palaces for centuries.   a Closer look:  Bengal   The Growth of a Regional Language  As we saw at the outset, we often tend to identify regions  in terms of the language spoken by the people. So, we  assume  that  people  in  Bengal  always  spoke  Bengali.  However,  what  is  interesting  is  that  while  Bengali  is  now recognised as a language derived from Sanskrit,  early Sanskrit texts (mid-first millennium bce) suggest  that  the  people  of  Bengal  did  not  speak  Sanskritic   languages. How, then, did the new language emerge?   From the fourth-third centuries bce, commercial ties  began to develop between Bengal and Magadha (south  Bihar), which may have led to the growing influence  of  Sanskrit.  During  the  fourth  century,  the  Gupta  rulers established political control over north Bengal  and began to settle Brahmanas in this area. Thus, the  linguistic and cultural influence from the mid-Ganga  valley  became  stronger.  In  the  seventh  century,  the  Chinese traveller Xuan Zang observed that languages  related to Sanskrit were in use all over Bengal.   From the eighth century, Bengal became the centre  of  a  regional  kingdom  under  the  Palas  (Chapter  2).  Between  the  fourteenth  and  sixteenth  centuries,  Bengal was ruled by Sultans who were independent of  the rulers in Delhi (Chapter 3). In 1586, when Akbar   Fig. 10 A page from a  palm-leaf manuscript  of the earliest Bengali  Ramayana.  87  Unit 5 to 7.indd   87  17-05-2022   12:16:52  the making of  regional culturesRationalised 2023-24conquered Bengal, it formed the nucleus of the Bengal  suba. While Persian was the language of administration,  Bengali developed as a regional language.   In fact, by the fifteenth century the Bengali group  of  dialects  came  to  be  united  by  a  common  literary  language based on the spoken language of the western  part  of  the  region,  now  known  as  West  Bengal.  Thus,  although  Bengali  is  derived  from  Sanskrit,  it  passed  through  several  stages  of  evolution.  Also,  a  wide  range  of  non-Sanskrit  words,  derived  from  a  variety of sources including tribal languages, Persian,  and  European  languages,  have  become  a  part  of   modern Bengali.   Early  Bengali  literature  may  be  divided  into  two  categories  –  one  indebted  to  Sanskrit  and  the  other  independent of it. The first includes translations of the  Sanskrit epics, the Mangalakavyas (literally auspicious  poems, dealing with local deities) and bhakti literature,  such as the biographies of Chaitanyadeva, the leader  of the Vaishnava bhakti movement (Chapter 6).   The  second  includes  Nath  literature,  such  as  the  songs  of  Maynamati  and  Gopichandra,  stories  concerning the worship of Dharma Thakur, and fairy  tales, folk tales and ballads.   maynamati, Gopichandra and                   dharma Thakur   The  Naths  were  ascetics  who  engaged in  a  variety  of  yogic practices.   This  particular  song,  which  was  often  enacted,  described  how  Maynamati,  a  queen,  encouraged  her  son Gopichandra to adopt the path of asceticism in the  face of a variety of obstacles.   Dharma  Thakur  is  a  popular  regional  deity,  often   worshipped in the form of a stone or a piece of wood.  The texts belonging to the first category are easier  to  date,  as  several  manuscripts  have  been  found  indicating  that  they  were  composed  between  the   88  Unit 5 to 7.indd   88  17-05-2022   12:16:52  our pasts – iiRationalised 2023-24late  fifteenth  and  mid-eighteenth  centuries.  Those  belonging  to  the  second  category  circulated  orally  and cannot be precisely dated. They were particularly  popular  in  eastern  Bengal,  where  the  influence  of  Brahmanas was relatively weak.  Pirs and Temples  From the sixteenth century, people began to migrate  in large numbers from the less fertile western Bengal  to  the  forested  and  marshy  areas  of  south-eastern  Bengal.  As  they  moved  eastwards,  they  cleared  forests and brought the land under rice cultivation.  Gradually,  local  communities  of  fisherfolk  and  shifting  cultivators,  often  tribals,  merged  with  the  new communities of peasants.   This  coincided  with  the  establishment  of  Mughal  control over Bengal with their capital in the heart of  the eastern delta at Dhaka. Officials and functionaries  received land and often set up mosques that served  as centres for religious transformation in these areas.    The early settlers sought some order and assurance  in  the  unstable  conditions  of  the  new  settlements.  These were provided by community leaders, who also  functioned  as  teachers  and  adjudicators  and  were  sometimes ascribed with supernatural powers. People  referred to them with affection and respect as pirs.  This  term  included  saints  or  Sufis  and  other  religious  personalities,  daring  colonisers  and  deified  soldiers, various Hindu and Buddhist deities and even  animistic spirits. The cult of pirs became very popular  and their shrines can be found everywhere in Bengal.    Bengal  also  witnessed  a  temple-building  spree  from the late fifteenth century, which culminated in  the  nineteenth  century.  We  have  seen  (Chapter  2)  that temples and other religious structures were often  built  by  individuals  or  groups  who  were  becoming  powerful  –  to  both  demonstrate  their  power  and  proclaim  their  piety.  Many  of  the  modest  brick    89  ?  Why do you  think the second  category of texts  was not written  down?   Pir  A Persian word  meaning a  spiritual guide.

The coming of the European trading companies created  new economic opportunities; many families belonging  to these social groups availed of these. As their social  and  economic  position  improved,  they  proclaimed  their  status  through  the  construction  of  temples.  When local deities, once worshipped in thatched huts  in villages, gained the recognition of the Brahmanas,  their  images  began  to  be  housed  in  temples.  The  temples began to copy the double-roofed (dochala) or  four-roofed (chauchala) structure of the thatched huts.  This led to the evolution of the typical Bengali style in   temple architecture.   In  the  comparatively  more  complex  four-roofed  structure,  four  triangular  roofs  placed  on  the  four  walls move up to converge on a curved line or a point.  Temples were usually built on a square platform. The  interior was relatively plain, but the outer walls of many  temples  were  decorated  with  paintings,  ornamental  tiles or terracotta tablets. In some temples, particularly  in Vishnupur in the Bankura district of West Bengal,  such decorations reached a high degree of excellence.   ?

Fig. 14 Fish being  dressed for domestic  consumption,  terracotta plaque  from the Vishalakshi  temple, Arambagh.  Fish as Food   Traditional food habits are generally based  on locally available items of food. Bengal  is a riverine plain which produces plenty  of  rice  and  fish.  Understandably,  these  two items figure prominently in the menu  of even poor Bengalis. Fishing has always  been an important occupation and Bengali  literature  contains  several  references  to  fish. What is more, terracotta plaques on  the walls of temples and viharas (Buddhist  monasteries)  depict  scenes  of  fish  being  dressed and taken to the market in baskets.   Brahmanas were not allowed to eat non- vegetarian food, but the popularity of fish  in  the  local  diet  made  the  Brahmanical  authorities  relax  this  prohibition  for  the  Bengal  Brahmanas.  The  Brihaddharma  Purana,  a  thirteenth-century  Sanskrit  text  from  Bengal,  permitted  the  local  Brahmanas to eat certain varieties of fish.   91  Unit 5 to 7.indd   91  17-05-2022   12:16:58  the making of  regional culturesRationalised 2023-24Imagine  You are a Rajput prince.

21,21,0,"8 EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY  POLITICAL FORMATIONS  If  you  look  at  Maps  1  and  2  closely,  you  will  see    something significant happening in the subcontinent  during the first half of the eighteenth century. Notice  how  the  boundaries  of  the  Mughal  Empire  were  reshaped by the emergence of a number of independent   Map 1 State formations in the  eighteenth century.  94  Unit 8.indd   94  8/25/2022   12:22:13 PM  our pasts – iiRationalised 2023-24kingdoms.  By  1765,  notice  how  another  power, the British, had  successfully  grabbed  major chunks of territory  in eastern India. What  these  maps  tell  us  is  that political conditions  in  eighteenth-century  India  changed  quite  dramatically and within  a  relatively  short  span  of time.   In  this  chapter,  we  will  read  about  the  e m e r g e n c e   o f   n e w  political  groups  in  the  subcontinent  during   the  first  half  of  the  eighteenth  century  –  roughly  from  1707,  when  Aurangzeb  died,  till  the  third  battle  of  Panipat in 1761.  The Crisis of the Empire and   the Later Mughals In Chapter 4, you saw how the Mughal Empire reached  the height of its success and started facing a variety  of crises towards the closing years of the seventeenth  century. These were caused by a number of factors.  Emperor  Aurangzeb  had  depleted  the  military  and  financial  resources  of  his  empire  by  fighting  a  long  war in the Deccan.   Under his successors, the efficiency of the imperial  administration  broke  down.  It  became  increasingly  difficult for the later Mughal emperors to keep a check  on  their  powerful  mansabdars.  Nobles  appointed  as  governors  (subadars)  often  controlled  the  offices   95  Map 2 British territories in  the mid-eighteenth  century.  ?  See Chapter 4,  Table 1. Which  group of people  challenged Mughal  authority for the  longest time in  Aurangzeb’s reign?  Unit 8.indd   95  17-05-2022   12:40:39  eighteenth-centurypolitical formationsRationalised 2023-24of  revenue  and  military  administration  (diwani  and  faujdari) as well. This gave them extraordinary political,  economic and military powers over vast regions of the  Mughal Empire. As the governors consolidated their  control over the provinces, the periodic remission of  revenue to the capital declined.  Peasant and zamindari rebellions in many parts of  northern and western India added to these problems.  These revolts were sometimes caused by the pressures  of mounting taxes. At other times they were attempts  by  powerful  chieftains  to  consolidate  their  own  positions. Mughal authority had been challenged by  rebellious groups in the past as well. But these groups  were now able to seize the economic resources of the  region  to  consolidate  their  positions.  The  Mughal  emperors after Aurangzeb were unable to arrest the  gradual shifting of political and economic authority  into the hands of provincial governors, local chieftains  and other groups.   Rich harvests and empty coffers   The following is a contemporary writer’s account of the  financial bankruptcy of the empire:   The great lords are helpless and impoverished. Their peasants  raise two crops a year, but their lords see nothing of either, and  their agents on the spot are virtual prisoners in the peasants’  hands,  like  a  peasant  kept  in  his  creditor’s  house  until  he  can pay his debt. So complete is the collapse of all order and  administration that though the peasant reaps a harvest of  gold, his lord does not see so much as a wisp of straw. How  then can the lord keep the armed force he should? How can  he pay the soldiers who should go before him when he goes  out, or the horsemen who should ride behind him?  96  Unit 8.indd   96  17-05-2022   12:40:40  our pasts – iiRationalised 2023-24  In the midst of this economic and political crisis, the  ruler of Iran, Nadir Shah, sacked and plundered the  city of Delhi in 1739 and took away immense amounts  of  wealth.  This  invasion  was  followed  by  a  series  of  plundering  raids  by  the  Afghan  ruler  Ahmad  Shah  Abdali,  who  invaded  north  India  five  times  between  1748 and 1761.  Nadir Shah attacks Delhi  The devastation of Delhi after Nadir Shah’s invasion was  described by contemporary observers. One described  the wealth looted from the Mughal treasury as follows:   sixty lakhs of rupees and some thousand gold coins, nearly one  crore worth of gold-ware, nearly fifty crores worth of jewels,  most of them unrivalled in the world, and the above included  the Peacock throne.    Another  account  described  the  invasion’s  impact   upon Delhi:   (those) … who had been masters were now in dire straits;  and  those  who  had  been  revered  couldn’t  even  (get  water  to) quench their thirst. The recluses were pulled out of their  corners. The wealthy were turned into beggars. Those who  once  set  the  style  in  clothes  now  went  naked;  and  those  who owned property were now homeless … The New City  (Shahjahanabad) was turned into rubble. (Nadir Shah) then  attacked the Old quarters of the city and destroyed a whole  world that existed there …  Fig. 1 A 1779 portrait of Nadir  Shah.  Already under severe pressure from all sides, the  empire was further weakened by competition amongst  different  groups  of  nobles.  They  were  divided  into  two major groups or factions, the Iranis and Turanis  (nobles of Turkish descent). For a long time, the later  Mughal emperors were puppets in the hands of either   97  Unit 8.indd   97  17-05-2022   12:40:40  eighteenth-centurypolitical formationsRationalised 2023-24one or the other of these two powerful groups.  The worst possible humiliation came when two  Mughal  emperors,  Farrukh  Siyar  (1713 –1719)  and Alamgir II (1754 –1759) were assassinated,  and two others, Ahmad Shah (1748 –1754) and  Shah  Alam  II  (1759 –1816)  were  blinded  by   their nobles.  With  the  decline  in  the  authority  of  the  Mughal  emperors,  the  governors  of  large  provinces,  subadars,  and  the  great  zamindars  consolidated  their  authority  in  different  parts  of  the  subcontinent,  such  as  Awadh,  Bengal   and Hyderabad.   Fig. 2 Farrukh Siyar receiving  a noble in court.  Many Rajput  rulers had  accepted the  suzerainty of  the Mughals but  Mewar was the  only Rajput state  which defied  Mughal authority.  Rana Pratap  ascended the  throne at Mewar  in 1572, with  Udaipur and large  part of Mewar  under his control.  A series of envoys  were sent to the  Rana to persuade  him to accept  Mughal suzerainty,   but he stood his  ground.  The Rajputs  Many  Rajput  kings,  particularly  those  belonging  to  Amber and Jodhpur, had served under the Mughals  with distinction. In exchange, they were permitted to  enjoy considerable autonomy in their watan jagirs. In  the eighteenth century, these rulers now attempted to  extend their control over adjacent regions. Ajit Singh,  the ruler of Jodhpur, was also involved in the factional  politics at the Mughal court.   These  influential  Rajput  families  claimed  the  subadari of the rich provinces of Gujarat and Malwa.  Raja Ajit Singh of Jodhpur held the governorship of  Gujarat and Sawai Raja Jai Singh of Amber was the  governor  of  Malwa.  These  offices  were  renewed  by   Emperor Jahandar Shah in 1713. They also tried to  extend their territories by seizing portions of imperial  territories  neighbouring  their  watans.  Nagaur  was  conquered  and  annexed  to  the  house  of  Jodhpur,  while  Amber  seized  large  portions  of  Bundi.  Sawai  Raja  Jai  Singh  founded  his  new  capital  at  Jaipur  and was given the subadari of Agra in 1722. Maratha  campaigns into Rajasthan from the 1740s put severe  pressure  on  these  principalities  and  checked  their  further expansion.  98  Unit 8.indd   98  17-05-2022   12:40:41  our pasts – iiRationalised 2023-24Many  Rajput  chieftains  built  a  number of forts on hill tops which  became  the  centres  of  power.  With  extensive  fortifications,  t h e s e   m a j e s t i c   s t r u c t u re s    housed urban centres, palaces,  temples, trading centres, water  harvesting structures and other  buildings.  The  Chittorgarh  fort  contained many water bodies varying from talabs (ponds)  to kundis (wells), baolis (stepwells), etc.  Fig. 3  Chittorgarh Fort, Rajasthan  Raja Jai Singh of Jaipur  A description of Raja Jai Singh in a Persian account of  1732:   Raja Jai Singh was at the height of his power.

Fig. 4 Jantar Mantar in  Jaipur  Sawai Jai Singh,  the ruler of Amber  constructed five  astronomical  observatories,  one each in  Delhi, Jaipur,  Ujjain, Mathura  and Varanasi.

Do you recall  reading about  it in Chapter 6?  Seizing Independence  The Sikhs  The organisation of the Sikhs into a political community  during the seventeenth century (see Chapter 6) helped  in regional state-building in the Punjab. Several battles  were fought by Guru Gobind Singh against the Rajput  and Mughal rulers, both before and after the institution  of the Khalsa in 1699. After his death in 1708, the Khalsa  rose in revolt against the Mughal authority under Banda  Bahadur’s leadership, declared their sovereign rule by  striking coins in the name of Guru Nanak and Guru  Gobind Singh, and established their own administration  between the Sutlej and the Jamuna. Banda Bahadur  was captured in 1715 and executed in 1716.   Fig. 6 Sword of Maharaja  Ranjit Singh.  100  Unit 8.indd   100  17-05-2022   12:40:44  our pasts – iiRationalised 2023-24Under a number of able leaders in the eighteenth  century,  the  Sikhs  organised  themselves  into  a  number of bands called jathas, and later on misls.  Their  combined  forces  were  known  as  the  grand  army  (dal  khalsa).  The  entire  body  used  to  meet  at  Amritsar  at  the  time  of  Baisakhi  and  Diwali  to  take  collective  decisions  known  as  “resolutions  of  the  Guru  (gurmatas)”.  A  system  called  rakhi  was  introduced, offering protection to cultivators on the  payment of a tax of 20 per cent of the produce.   Guru Gobind Singh had inspired the Khalsa with  the belief that their destiny was to rule (raj karega  khalsa). Their well-knit organisation enabled them  to  put  up  a  successful  resistance  to  the  Mughal  governors first and then to Ahmad Shah Abdali who  had seized the rich province of the Punjab and the  Sarkar  of  Sirhind  from  the  Mughals.  The  Khalsa  declared their sovereign rule by striking their own  coin again in 1765. Significantly, this coin bore the  same inscription as the one on the orders issued by  the Khalsa in the time of Banda Bahadur.    The Sikh territories in the late eighteenth century  extended  from  the  Indus  to  the  Jamuna  but  they  were  divided  under  different  rulers.  One  of  them,  Maharaja Ranjit Singh, reunited these groups and  established his capital at Lahore in 1799.    The Marathas  The Maratha kingdom was another powerful regional  kingdom  to  arise  out  of  a  sustained  opposition  to  Mughal rule. Shivaji (1627–1680) carved out a stable  kingdom with the support of powerful warrior families  (deshmukhs).  Groups  of  highly  mobile,  peasant- pastoralists (kunbis) provided the backbone of the  Maratha army. Shivaji used these forces to challenge  the Mughals in the peninsula. After Shivaji’s death,  effective power in the Maratha state was wielded by a  family of Chitpavan Brahmanas who served Shivaji’s  successors as Peshwa (or principal minister). Poona  became the capital of the Maratha kingdom.  101  Fig. 7 Portrait of Shivaji  Towards the end of the  17th century,   a powerful state  started emerging in  the Deccan under the  leadership of Shivaji  which finally led to the  establishment of the  Maratha state. Shivaji  was born to Shahji and  Jija Bai at Shivneri  in 1630.  Under the  guidance of his mother  and his guardian  Dada Konddev, Shivaji  embarked on a career  of conquest at a young  age. The occupation  of Javli made him the  undisputed leader of  the Mavala highlands  which paved the way  for further expansion.  His exploits against  the forces of Bijapur  and the Mughals  made him a legendary  figure. He often  resorted to guerrilla  warfare against  his opponents. By  introducing an efficient  administrative system  supported by a revenue  collection method  based on chauth and  sardeshmukhi, he laid  the foundations of a  strong Maratha state.   Unit 8.indd   101  17-05-2022   12:40:45  eighteenth-centurypolitical formationsRationalised 2023-24Baji Rao I, also  known as Baji  Rao Ballal was  the son of Peshwa  Balaji Vishwanath.  He was  a great  Maratha general  who is credited to  have expanded  the Maratha  kingdom beyond  the Vindhyas and  is known for his  military campaigns  against Malwa,  Bundelkhand,  Gujarat and the  Portugese.  Chauth 25 per cent of  the land revenue  claimed by  zamindars. In the  Deccan, this was  collected by the  Marathas.  Sardeshmukhi 9 –10 per cent of  the land revenue  paid to the head  revenue collector   in the Deccan.   Under the Peshwas, the Marathas developed a very  successful  military  organisation.  Their  success  lay  in  bypassing  the  fortified  areas  of  the  Mughals,  by  raiding cities and by engaging Mughal armies in areas  where their supply lines and reinforcements could be  easily disturbed.   Between  1720  and  1761,  the  Maratha  empire  expanded. It gradually chipped away at the authority  of the Mughal Empire. Malwa and Gujarat were seized  from  the  Mughals  by  the  1720s.  By  the  1730s,  the  Maratha  king  was  recognised  as  the  overlord  of  the  entire  Deccan  peninsula.  He  possessed  the  right  to  levy chauth and sardeshmukhi in the entire region.    After raiding Delhi in 1737, the frontiers of Maratha  domination expanded rapidly: into Rajasthan and the  Punjab  in  the  north;  into  Bengal  and  Orissa  in  the  east; and into Karnataka and the Tamil and Telugu  countries  in  the  South  (see  Map  1).  These  were  not  formally  included  in  the  Maratha  empire,  but  were  made  to  pay  tribute  as  a  way  of  accepting  Maratha  sovereignty. Expansion brought enormous resources,  but it came at a price. These military campaigns also  made other rulers hostile towards the Marathas. As a  result, they were not inclined to support the Marathas   during the third battle of Panipat in 1761.  Alongside endless military campaigns, the Marathas  developed an effective administrative system as well.  Once conquest had been completed and Maratha rule  was secure, revenue demands were gradually introduced  taking local conditions into account. Agriculture was  encouraged and trade revived. This allowed Maratha  chiefs (sardars) like Sindhia of Gwalior, Gaekwad of  Baroda and Bhonsle of Nagpur the resources to raise  powerful  armies.  Maratha  campaigns  into  Malwa  in  the 1720s did not challenge the growth and prosperity  of  the  cities  in  the  region.  Ujjain  expanded  under  Sindhia’s  patronage  and  Indore  under  Holkar’s.  By  all accounts, these cities were large and prosperous  and functioned as important commercial and cultural  centres.  New  trade  routes  emerged  within  the  areas  controlled by the Marathas. The silk produced in the  Chanderi  region  now  found  a  new  outlet  in  Poona,  the  Maratha  capital.  Burhanpur  which  had  earlier   102  Unit 8.indd   102  17-05-2022   12:40:45  our pasts – iiRationalised 2023-24participated in the trade between Agra and Surat now  expanded its hinterland to include Poona and Nagpur  in the South and Lucknow and Allahabad in the East.  The Jats  Like the other states, the Jats consolidated their power  during the late seventeenth and eighteenth-centuries.  Under their leader, Churaman, they acquired control  over territories situated to the west of the city of Delhi,  and  by  the  1680s,  they  had  begun  dominating  the  region  between  the  two  imperial  cities  of  Delhi  and  Agra. For a while, they became the virtual custodians  of the city of Agra.    The Jats were prosperous agriculturists, and towns  like  Panipat  and  Ballabhgarh  became  important  trading centres in the areas dominated by them. Under  Suraj  Mal  the  kingdom  of  Bharatpur  emerged  as  a  strong state. When Nadir Shah sacked Delhi in 1739,  many of the city’s notables took refuge there. His son  Jawahir Shah had 30,000 troops of his own and hired  another  20,000  Maratha  and  15,000  Sikh  troops  to  fight the Mughals.  While  the  Bharatpur  fort  was  built  in  a  fairly  traditional  style,  at  Dig  the  Jats  built  an  elaborate  garden palace combining styles seen at Amber and Agra.  Its buildings were modelled on architectural forms first  associated with royalty under Shah Jahan.   The power of  the Jats reached  its zenith under  Suraj Mal who  consolidated the Jat  state at Bharatpur  (in present day  Rajasthan) during  1756 –1763. The  areas under the  political control of  Suraj Mal broadly  included parts of  modern eastern  Rajasthan, southern  Haryana, western  Uttar Pradesh and  Delhi. Suraj Mal  built a number of  forts and palaces  and the famous  Lohagarh fort  in Bharatpur is  regarded as one of  the strongest forts    built in this region.

22,22,0,"1 Environment  After the long vacation, when Ravi started going to school again, he noticed that the only playground next to his school was dug up. People said that a huge building with many flats will be constructed there. Ravi was almost in tears, when  he  realised  that  the  big  playground  with  its  soft grass, marigolds and butterflies is gone for ever. He shared his  feelings  with  his  classmates.  In  the  assembly,  the Principal  too  sadly  observed,  “See  how  our  environment is changing.”  In  the  class  Ravi  asked  his  teacher,  “What  is environment?” “Whatever you see in your surroundings,” said the teacher.  Ravi thought aloud, “That means, the school building, tables, chairs in the classroom, even that open field, the road,  the  garbage,  my  friends  –  all  are  parts  of  our environment”!  “Yes” said the teacher, “but wait….. Some objects are created by nature – for example, mountains, rivers, trees, animals. Others are made by people – for example roads, cars,  clothes,  books”.  Now work in pairs. Make a list with your classmate sitting  next  to  you,  of  the  creations  of  nature  and  by human beings.  Ravi, Paramjeet, Jessy, Mustafa, Asha were all excited about making the list. “Why is our environment changing?” asked  Iqbal.  “It’s  all  because  of  our  needs.  They  are  Environment  is  our basic  life  support system.  It  provides the  air  we  breath,  the water  we  drink,  the food we eat and the land  where  we  live.  How do human beings  modify  this natural  environment? The  car  fumes  pollute the  air,  water  is collected  in  a  pot, food  is  served  in vessels  and  land  is used  to  build factories.  Human  beings make  cars,  mills, factories  and manufacture containers.  This  is how  human  beings modify  natural environment.

Abiotic The world of non-living elements. e.g. land.  From  the  above  conversation  you understand that the place, people, things and nature that surround any living organism is called environment. It is a combination of natural and human made phenomena. While the natural environment refers to both biotic and abiotic conditions existing on the earth,  Biotic The world of living organisms. e.g. plants and animals.  2 OUR  ENVIRONMENT  Rationalised 2023-24human environment reveals the activities, creations and interactions among human beings.  NATURAL ENVIRONMENT Land, water, air, plants and animals comprise the natural environment.  You  are  familiar  with  the  meaning  of lithosphere,  hydrosphere,  atmosphere  and  biosphere from your previous class. Let us learn some more facts about these domains.  Lithosphere is the solid crust or the hard top layer of the earth. It is made up of rocks and minerals and covered by  a  thin  layer  of  soil.  It  is  an  irregular  surface  with various landforms such as mountains, plateaus, plains, valleys,  etc.  Landforms  are  found  over  the  continents and also on the ocean floors.  Lithosphere is the domain that provides us forests, grasslands for grazing, land for agriculture and human settlements. It is also a source of mineral wealth.  Word Origin  Environment:  French word Environer/ Environner  meaning “neighbourhood”.  Let’s do  Look at your surroundings.  Make  a list  of  uses  that  the land in your neighbourhood  is being  put  to.  Atmosphere  Biosphere  Lithosphere  Hydrosphere  Fig. 1.2: Domains of the Environment  The domain of water is referred to as hydrosphere. It comprises various sources of water and different types of water  bodies  like  rivers,  lakes,  seas,  oceans,  etc.  It  is essential for all living organisms.  The  atmosphere  is  the  thin  layer  of  air  that surrounds  the  earth.  The  gravitational  force  of  the earth holds the atmosphere around it. It protects us  Let’s do  Where  does  the  water you use in your home and  school  come from?  Make  a  list  of different  uses  of water  in  our  daily  life. Have  you  seen  anyone wasting  water?  How?  Let’s do  Observe  the  sky  while coming  to  school. Make  a  note  whether the  day  is  cloudy, rainy,  sunny,  foggy  etc.  ENVIRONMENT  3  Rationalised 2023-24Glossary  Ecosystem:  It  is  a system  formed  by  the interaction  of  all living  organisms  with each  other  and  with the  physical  and chemical  factors  of the  environment  in which  they  live,  all linked  by  transfer  of energy  and  material.  Let’s do  Sketch  or  bring photographs  of  your place  like  the students  in  the  story.  from the harmful rays and scorching heat of the sun. It consists of a number of gases, dust and water vapour. The  changes  in  the  atmosphere  produce  changes  in the weather and climate.  Plant and animal kingdom together make biosphere or  the  living  world.  It  is  a  narrow  zone  of  the  earth where land, water and air interact with each other to support life.  What is ecosystem? At an NCC camp that Ravi’s class was attending, Jessy exclaimed, “What a heavy downpour.  It reminds me of my  home  in  Kerala.  You  should  come  and  see  how  it pours  and  pours  and  pours  over  the  lush  green  fields and coconut plantations.”  Heera  from  Jaisalmer  exclaimed,  “We  get  no  rains. We  see  only  ‘kikar’  and  sand,  as  far  as  the  eyes  can see.” “But you also find camels”, said Ravi.  4 OUR  ENVIRONMENT  Fig. 1.3: A Pond Ecosystem  Rationalised 2023-24Heera says, “Not just camels. If you visit our desert,  Do you know?  you will see snakes, lizards and many insects too.”   Ravi wondered, “Why do the animals, the vegetation and the way people live vary from place to place? Are they all related to each other?”  “Oh yes, very much so”, the teacher replied.  All  plants,  animals  and  human  beings  depend  on their  immediate  surroundings.  Often  they  are  also interdependent on each other. This relation between the living  organisms,  as  well  as  the  relation  between  the organisms and their surroundings form an ecosystem. There  could  be  an  ecosystem  of  large  rain  forest, grassland, desert, mountains, lake, river, ocean and even a small pond.  Do you think the park in which Ravi and his friends  played formed an ecosystem?  HUMAN ENVIRONMENT Human beings interact with the environment and modify it  according  to  their  need.  Early  humans  adapted themselves  to  the  natural  surroundings.  They  led  a simple  life  and  fulfilled  their  requirements  from  the nature around them. With time needs grew and became more varied. Humans learn new ways to use and change environment.  They  learn  to  grow  crops,  domesticate animals and lead a settled life. The wheel was invented, surplus food was produced, barter system emerged, trade started and commerce developed. Industrial revolution enabled large scale production. Transportation became faster.  Information  revolution  made  communication easier and speedy across the world.  Have  you  ever  thought  why  you  love  eating  a  juicy watermelon  in  summer  and  hot  roasted  peanuts  in winter?  A  perfect  balance  is  necessary  between  the natural and human environment. Humans must learn to live and use their environment in a harmonious way.  Nurie, a girl from Mizoram from Ravi’s class often talks about  the  lush  green  surroundings  of  her  place.  Seeing Ravi  upset  at  having  lost  his  playground,  Nurie  invited him to visit her home state during the coming vacation. Ravi’s teacher asked the students to draw the landscape, houses and activities of the people and places they visit during the holidays.  On  5  June  every  year the  World  Environment Day  is  celebrated.  Glossary  Barter  System: It  is  a  trade  in  which goods  are  exchanged without  the  use  of money.

23,23,0,"2 Inside Our Earth  The  earth,  our  homeland  is  a  dynamic  planet.  It  is constantly undergoing changes inside and outside. Have you ever wondered what lies in the interior of the earth? What is the earth made up of?  Do you know?  • The  deepest  mine  in  the  world,  is  in South  Africa.  It  is about 4 km. deep. In search  for  oil engineers  have  dug  a hole about 6 km. deep.  • To  reach  to  the  centre  of  the  earth (which  is  not possible!)  you  will have to dig a hole 6000 km. deep on the  ocean  floor.  Crust  Mantle  Inner core  Lithosphere  Core-mantle boundary  Outer core  Fig. 2.1: Interior of the Earth  Continental Crust  Continent  Ocean  Oceanic Crust  Fig. 2.2: Continental Crust and Oceanic Crust  INTERIOR OF THE EARTH Just like an onion, the earth  is  made  up  of concentric several  layers  with  one  inside another  (Fig.  2.1).  The uppermost  layer  over the  earth’s  surface  is called the crust. It is the thinnest  of  all  the layers. It is about 35 km. on  the  continental masses and only 5 km. on the ocean floors. The  main  mineral constituents  of  the continental  mass  are silica and alumina. It is thus  called  sial  (si-silica and  al-alumina).   The oceanic  crust  mainly consists  of  silica  and magnesium; it is therefore called sima (si-silica and ma-magnesium) (Fig. 2.2). Just beneath the crust is  the  mantle  which extends up to a depth of 2900 km. below the crust.  Rationalised 2023-24Do you know?  • The  crust  forms  only  1 per cent of the volume  of  the  earth, 84  per  cent  consists of  the  mantle  and 15 per cent makes the  core.  • The  radius  of  the earth  is  6371  km.  Word Origin  Igneous:  Latin  word Ignis  meaning  fire. Sedimentary:  Latin word sedimentum meaning  settle  down. Metamorphic:  Greek word  metamorphose meaning change of form.  Glossary  Fossils:  The  remains of  the  dead  plants  and animals  trapped  in the  layers  of  rocks  are called  fossils.  The innermost layer is the core with a radius of about 3500 km. It is mainly made up of nickel and iron and is called  nife  (ni  –  nickel  and  fe  –  ferrous  i.e.  iron).  The central core has very high temperature and pressure.  ROCKS AND MINERALS The earth’s crust is made up of various types of rocks. Any natural mass of mineral matter that makes up the earth’s crust is called a rock. Rocks can be of different colour, size and texture.  There are three major types of rocks: igneous rocks,  sedimentary rocks and metamorphic rocks.  When  the  molten  magma  cools,  it  becomes  solid. Rocks  thus  formed  are  called  igneous  rocks.  They  are also called primary rocks. There are two types of igneous rocks: intrusive rocks and extrusive rocks.  Can you imagine lava coming out from the volcanoes? Lava is actually fiery red molten magma coming out from the interior of the earth on its surface. When this molten lava comes on the earth’s surface, it rapidly cools down and becomes solid. Rocks formed in such a way on the crust are called extrusive igneous rocks. They have a very  fine  grained  structure.  For  example,  basalt.  The Deccan plateau is made up of basalt rocks. Sometimes the molten magma cools down deep inside the earth’s crust. Solid rocks so formed are called intrusive igneous rocks.  Since  they  cool  down  slowly  they  form  large grains. Granite is an example of such a rock. Grinding stones used to prepare paste/powder of spices and grains are made of granite.  Rocks  roll  down,  crack,  and  hit  each  other  and  are broken down into small fragments. These smaller particles are called sediments. These sediments are transported and  deposited  by  wind,  water,  etc.  These  loose sediments are compressed and hardened to form layers  of  rocks.  These  types  of  rocks  are  called sedimentary  rocks.  For  example,  sandstone  is made from grains of sand. These rocks may also contain fossils of plants, animals and other micro- organisms that once lived on them.  Fig. 2.3: Sedimentary rock turned into a Metamorphic rock  8 OUR  ENVIRONMENT  Igneous  and  sedimentary  rocks  can  change into  metamorphic  rocks  under  great  heat  and pressure (Fig. 2.3). For example, clay changes into slate and limestone into marble.  Rationalised 2023-24Rocks are very useful to us. The hard rocks are used for making roads, houses and buildings. You use stones in many games. For example, seven stones (pitthoo), hop- scotch (stapu/kit kit), five stones (gitti). Find out some more such games by asking your grand parents, parents, neighbours, etc.  Let’s do  Collect  pictures  of  some  monuments  and  find  out  which  are  the  rocks used  to  build  them.  Two  pictures  have  been  collected  for  you.  The Red Fort is made of red sandstone  The Taj Mahal is made of white marble  You will be surprised to know that one type of rock changes to another type under certain conditions in a cyclic manner. This process of transformation of the rock from  one  to  another  is  known  as  the  rock  cycle.  You have  already  learnt  when  the molten magma cools; it solidifies to  become  igneous  rock.  These igneous  rocks  are  broken  down into  small  particles  that  are transported  and  deposited  to form  sedimentary  rocks.  When the  igneous  and  sedimentary rocks  are  subjected  to  heat and  pressure  they  change into  metamorphic  rocks.  The metamorphic rocks which are still under  great  heat  and  pressure melt down to form molten magma. This  molten  magma  again  can cool  down  and  solidify  into igneous rocks (Fig. 2.4).

Rocks are made up of different minerals. Minerals are naturally occurring substances which have certain physical properties and definite chemical composition. Minerals are very important to humankind. Some are used  as  fuels.  For  example,  coal,  natural  gas  and petroleum.  They  are  also  used  in  industries  –  iron, aluminium,  gold,  uranium,  etc,  in  medicine,  in fertilisers, etc.  Exercises  1. Answer the following questions.

24,24,0,"3 Our Changing Earth  Activity  Take  a  small  coloured paper  pellet  and  put  it in  a  beaker half  filled with  water. Place  the beaker on a tripod  stand and  heat  it.  As  the water  warms  up,  you will  observe  that  the paper  pellet  is  moving upward  along  with  the warm  layers  of  water and  then sinks  back along  with the  cooler layers  of  water.  The molten  magma  inside the  earth  moves  in  a similar  manner.  Glossary  Lithospheric  plates: The  earth’s  crust consists  of  several large  and  some  small, rigid,  irregularly- shaped  plates  (slabs) which  carry continents  and  the ocean  floor.  The lithosphere is broken into a number of plates known as the Lithospheric plates. You will be surprised to know that these plates move around very slowly – just a few millimetres each year. This is because of the movement of the molten magma inside the earth. The molten magma inside the earth moves in a circular manner as shown in the activity.  The movement of these plates causes changes on the surface of the earth. The earth movements are divided on the basis of the forces which cause them. The forces which  act  in  the  interior  of  the  earth  are  called  as Endogenic forces and the forces that work on the surface of  the  earth  are  called  as  Exogenic  forces  (Fig.  3.1).  Earth movements  Endogenic forces  Exogenic forces  Sudden forces  Diastrophic forces  Erosional and Depositional  Earthquake  Building mountains  Volcano  Landslides  River  Wind  Sea-waves  Glaciers  Fig. 3.1: Evolution of Landforms  Endogenic forces sometimes produce sudden movements and at the other times produce slow movements.

The vibrations can travel all  round  the  earth.  These  vibrations  are  called earthquakes (Fig. 3.3). The place in the crust where the movement starts is called the focus. The place on the surface  above  the  focus  is  called  the  epicentre. Vibrations travel outwards from the epicentre as waves. Greatest damage is usually closest to the epicentre and the  strength  of  the  earthquake  decreases  away  from the centre.  Plate boundary  Epicentre  Seismic waves radiate out in all directions  Focus – this is where the earthquake occurs. It is the origin of the seismic energy .

What do you notice?  As  the  water boils  the  lid  begins  to shake.  The  things which  you  have  put on  the  lid  also vibrate.  The  beads  roll down and the spoon vibrates  to  make  a sound.  In  the  same manner,  the  earth vibrates  when  an earthquake  occurs.  Do you know?  There  are  three  types of  earthquake  waves: 1. P waves or  longitudinal  waves  2. S  waves  or  transverse  waves 3.

The magnitude  of  the earthquake  is measured  on  the Richter  scale.  An earthquake  of  2.0  or less  can  be  felt  only  a little.  An  earthquake over  5.0  can  cause damage  from  things falling.  A  6.0  or higher  magnitude  is considered  very strong  and  7.0  is classified  as  a  major earthquake.

Rationalised 2023-24MAJOR LAND FORMS The landscape is being continuously worn away by two processes – weathering and erosion. Weathering is the breaking up of the rocks on the earth’s surface. Erosion is the wearing away of the landscape by different agents like water, wind and ice. The eroded material is carried away or transported by water, wind, etc. and eventually deposited. This process of erosion and deposition create different landforms on the surface of the earth.  Work of a River The running water in the river erodes the landscape. When the river tumbles at steep angle over very hard rocks or down a steep valley side it forms a waterfall (Fig. 3.4).  Do you know?  •  There are  thousands  of  small waterfalls  in  the world.  The  highest waterfall  is  Angel Falls  of  Venezuela in  South  America. The  other  waterfalls are  Niagara  falls located  on  the border  between Canada  and  USA  in North  America  and Victoria  Falls  on the  borders  of Zambia  and Zimbabwe  in  Africa.  Hard rock  Softer rock undercut by the power of the water  Fig. 3.4: Waterfall  The  Niagra  falls  As the river enters the plain it twists and turns forming large  bends  known  as  meanders.  Due  to  continuous erosion and deposition along the sides of the meander, the ends of the meander loop come closer and  closer.  In  due  course  of  time  the meander  loop  cuts  off  from  the  river  and forms a cut-off lake, also called an ox-bow lake. At times the river overflows its banks. This  leads  to  the  flooding  of  the neighbouring areas. As it floods, it deposits layers of fine soil and other material called sediments along its banks. This leads to the formation of a flat fertile floodplain. The raised banks are called levees. As the river approaches the sea, the speed of the flowing  water  decreases  and  the  Fig. 3.5: Features made by a river in a flood plain  OUR  CHANGING  EARTH  15  Rationalised 2023-24Let’s do  Find  out  the  names  of a  few  rivers  of  the world  that  form  a delta.  river  begins  to  break  up into  a  number  of  streams called  distributaries.

Seawaves continuously  strike  at  the rocks.  Cracks  develop.  Over time  they  become  larger  and wider. Thus, hollow like caves are formed on the rocks. They are called sea caves. As these cavities  become  bigger  and bigger  only  the  roof  of  the caves remain, thus forming sea a r c h e s .   F u r t h e r,   e ro s i o n breaks the roof and only walls are  left.  These  wall  like  features  are  called  stacks. The steep rocky coast rising almost vertically above sea  water  is  called  sea  cliff.  The  sea  waves  deposit sediments along the shores forming beaches.

Try  to  collect  some pictures of sand dunes.  An active agent of erosion and deposition in the deserts is wind. In deserts you can see rocks in the shape of a mushroom, commonly called mushroom rocks. Winds erode the lower section of the rock more than the upper part. Therefore, such rocks have narrower base and wider top. When the wind blows, it lifts and transports sand from  one  place  to  another.  When  it  stops  blowing  the sand falls and gets deposited in low hill – like structures. These are called sand dunes (Fig. 3.9). When the grains of sand are very fine and light, the wind can carry it over very  long  distances.  When  such  sand  is  deposited  in large areas, it is called loess. Large deposits of loess is found in China.  Fig. 3.9: Sand Dunes  Exercises  1. Answer the following questions. (i) Why do the plates move?  (ii) What are exogenic and endogenic forces?

25,25,0,"4 Air  Do you know?  Carbon  dioxide released  in  the atmosphere  creates  a green  house  effect  by trapping  the  heat radiated  from  the earth.  It  is  therefore called  a  greenhouse gas  and  without  it  the earth  would  have  been too cold to live in. However,  when  its level  in  the atmosphere  increases due to factory smoke or  car  fumes,  the  heat retained  increases  the temperature  of  the earth.  This  is  called global  warming.  This rise  in  temperature causes  the  snow  in coldest  parts  of  the world to melt. As a result  the  sea  level rises,  causing  floods  in the  coastal  areas. There  may  be  drastic changes  in  the  climate of a place leading to extinction  of  some plants  and  animals  in the  long  run.  Our  earth  is  surrounded  by  a  huge  blanket  of  air called  atmosphere.  All  living  beings  on  this  earth depend  on  the  atmosphere  for  their  survival.  It provides us the air we breathe and protects us from the  harmful  effects  of  the  sun’s  rays.  Without  this blanket of protection, we would be baked alive by the heat  of  the  sun  during  day  and  get  frozen  during night.  So  it  is  this  mass  of  air  that  has  made  the temperature on the earth liveable.  COMPOSITION OF THE ATMOSPHERE Do you know that the air we take in while breathing is actually a mixture of many gases? Nitrogen and oxygen are  two  gases  which  make  up  the  bulk  of  the atmosphere. Carbon d i o x i d e ,   h e l i u m , o z o n e ,   a r g o n   a n d hydrogen  are  found in  lesser  quantities. A p a r t   f r o m   t h e s e g a s e s ,   t i n y   d u s t p a r t i c l e s   a r e   a l s o present in the air.

They  can  not  take  Fig. 4.1: Constituents of Air  Rationalised 2023-24nitrogen directly from the air. Bacteria, that live in the soil and roots of some plants, take nitrogen from the air and change its form so that plants can use it.  Oxygen is the second most plentiful gas in the air. Humans and animals take oxygen from the air as they breathe.  Green  plants  produce  oxygen  during photosynthesis. In this way oxygen content in the air remains  constant.  If  we  cut  trees  then  this  balance gets disturbed.  Carbon  dioxide  is  another  important  gas.  Green plants  use  carbon  dioxide  to  make  their  food  and release  oxygen.  Humans  or  animals  release  carbon dioxide.  The  amount  of  carbon  dioxide  released  by humans or animals seems to be equal to the amount used  by  the  plants  which  make  a  perfect  balance. However, the balance is upset by burning of fuels, such as  coal  and  oil.  They  add  billions  of  tons  of  carbon dioxide into the atmosphere each year. As a result, the increased  volume  of  carbon  dioxide  is  affecting  the earth’s weather and climate.  Activity  Do you know?  When  air  is  heated,  it expands,  becomes lighter  and  goes  up. Cold  air  is  denser  and heavy.  That  is  why  it tends  to  sink  down. When  hot  air  rises, cold  air  from surrounding  area rushes  there  to  fill  in the  gap.  That  is  how air  circulation  takes place.  Read and Ponder: Is global warming a serious issue in today’s world?  AIR  21  Rationalised 2023-24STRUCTURE OF THE ATMOSPHERE Our atmosphere is divided into five layers starting from the  earth’s  sur face.  These  are  T roposphere, Stratosphere,  Mesosphere,  Thermosphere  and Exosphere (Fig. 4.2).  Troposphere: This layer is the most important layer of the  atmosphere.  Its  average  height  is  13  km.  The  air we  breathe  exists  here. Almost  all  the  weather phenomena  like  rainfall, fog and hailstorm occur in this layer.  lies   Stratosphere:  Above  the troposphere  the stratosphere. It extends up to a height of 50 km. This layer  is  almost  free  from clouds  and  associated weather  phenomenon, making  conditions  most ideal for flying aeroplanes. One  important  feature  of stratosphere  is  that  it contains  a  layer  of  ozone gas.  We  have  just  learnt how  it  protects  us  from the  harmful  effect  of  the sun rays.  of   layer   Mesosphere:  This  is  the third  the atmosphere.  It  lies  above the stratosphere. It extends up to the height of 80 km. Meteorites  burn  up  in this layer on entering from the space.  Fig. 4.2: Layers of the Atmosphere  22 OUR  ENVIRONMENT  Thermosphere:  In thermosphere temperature rises  very  rapidly  with increasing  height. Ionosphere is a part of this layer.  It  extends  between  Rationalised 2023-2480-400  km.  This  layer  helps  in  radio  transmission.  In fact, radio waves transmitted from the earth are reflected back to the earth by this layer.  Exosphere: The upper most layer of the atmosphere is  known  as  exosphere.  This  layer  has  very  thin  air. Light  gases  like  helium  and  hydrogen  float  into  the space from here.  WEATHER AND CLIMATE “Is it going to rain today?” “Will it be bright and sunny today?”  How  many  times  have  we  heard  this  from anxious cricket fans speculating the fate of a One Day match? If we imagine our body to be a radio and the mind  its  speaker,  weather  is  something  that  fiddles with its control knobs. Weather is this hour-to-hour, day to day condition of the atmosphere. A hot or humid weather  may  make  one  irritable.  A  pleasant,  breezy weather may make one cheerful and even plan for an outing. Weather can change dramatically from day to day. However, the average weather condition of a place for a longer period of time represents the climate of a place.  Now  do  you  understand  why  we  have  daily weather forecasts.  Let’s do  For  ten  days  note down  weather  report from  a  local newspaper  and observe  the  changes occurring  in  the weather.  Do you know?  You  will  be  surprised to  know  that  the earth  receives  only  1 in  2,000,000,000 parts  of  the  sun’s energy.  Temperature The temperature you feel everyday is  the  temperataure  of  the atmosphere. The degree of hotness and  coldness  of  the  air  is  known as temperature.  The   temperature  of   the atmosphere  changes  not  only between  day  and  night  but  also from  season  to  season.  Summers are hotter than winters.  Thermometer: Measures the temperature  Barometre:  Measures atmospheric  pressure  An  important  factor  that influences  the  distribution  of is  insolation . temperature  Insolation  is  the  incoming  solar energy intercepted by the earth.

The  standard  unit  of measuring temperature  is  degree Celsius.  It  was invented  by  Anders Celsius.  On  the Celsius  scale  the water  freezes  at  0°C and  boils  at  100°C.  Do you know?  On  the  moon  there  is no  air  and  hence  no air  pressure.  Astronauts  have  to  wear  special protective  space  suits filled  with  air  when they go to the moon. If they  did  not  wear these  space  suits,  the counter  pressure exerted by the body of the  astronauts  would make  the  blood  vessels burst.  The  astronauts would  bleed.  Do you know?  A  wind  is  named  after the  direction  from which  it  blows,  e.g. the  wind  blowing  from the  west  is  called westerly.  24 OUR  ENVIRONMENT  temperature  decreases  in  the  same  manner.  Now  do you understand why poles are covered with snow? If the earth’s temperature rises too high, it would become too warm for some crops to grow. Temperature in cities is much higher than that of villages. The concrete and metals  in  buildings  and  the  asaphalt  of  roads  get heated up during the day. This heat is released during the  night.  Also, the crowded high rise buildings of the cities trap the warm air and thus raise the temperature of the cities.  Air Pressure You will be surprised to know that air above us presses us with a great force on our bodies. However, we don’t even feel it. This is because the air presses us from all directions and our body exerts a counter pressure.  Air pressure is defined as the pressure exerted by the weight  of  air  on  the  earth’s  surface.  As  we  go  up  the layers of atmosphere, the pressure falls rapidly. The air pressure is highest at sea level and decreases with height. Horizontally the distribution of air pressure is influenced by temperature of air at a given place. In areas where temperature is high the air gets heated and rises. This creates a low-pressure area. Low pressure is associated with cloudy skies and wet weather.  In areas having lower temperature, the air is cold. It is therefore heavy. Heavy air sinks and creates a high pressure area. High pressure is associated with clear and sunny skies.  The air always moves from high pressure areas to low  pressure areas.  Wind The movement of air from high pressure area to low pressure areas is called wind. You can see wind at work as it blows dry leaves down the pavement or uproots trees during a storm. Sometimes when the wind blows gently you can even see it blowing away smoke or fine dust. At times wind can be so strong that it is difficult to walk against it. You must have experienced it is not easy  to  hold  an  umbrella  on  a  windy  day.  Think  of some other examples when strong winds have created  Rationalised 2023-24problems  for  you.  Winds  can  be broadly divided into three types.  1. Permanent  winds  –  The  trade winds, westerlies and easterlies are  the  permanent  winds. These  blow  constantly throughout  the  year  in  a particular direction.  2. Seasonal  winds  –  These winds change their direction in  different  seasons.  For example monsoons in India.  3.

On  17-18 October  1999,  cyclone  hit  five districts  of  the  state.  Another supercyclone  occurred  on  the 29  October  1999,  that devastated large portions of the state.  The  damages  caused were  mainly  due  to  three factors: wind velocity, rain and tidal  surge.  The  winds  of  upto 260  km.  per  hour  lasted  for  over  36  hours.  These  high  velocity  winds uprooted  trees  and  damaged  the  kutcha  houses.  Roof  tops  of  several industrial  sheds  and  other  houses  were  also  blown  away.  Power  supply and  telecom  lines  snapped  completely.  Heavy  rain  occurred  under  the influence  of  the  cyclone  for  three  days  continuously.  These  rains  led  to flooding  in  the  major  rivers  of  Odisha.  The  cyclonic  winds  caused  tidal waves  that  swept  20  km.  inland  and  brought  massive  destruction  to  the coastal  areas.  The  7  to  10  m  high  tidal  wave  intruded  suddenly  and caused  massive  damage  to  the  standing  paddy  crops.  Destruction caused by a cyclone  AIR 25  Rationalised 2023-24The  cyclone  originated  as  a  “depression”  in  the  Gulf  of  Thailand, near  east  of  Port  Blair,  on  25  October  1999  and  gradually  moved  in  a northwestward  direction.  It  intensified  into  a  supercyclone  and  hit  the  area between Erasama and Balikuda in Odisha on 29 October at 10.30 a.m.  The  supercyclone  swept  the  entire  coast  of  Odisha  including  the cities  of  Bhubaneshwar  and  Cuttack  and  28  coastal  towns.  About  13 million  people  were  affected.  A  large  number  of  livestock  were  killed. Standing  crops  of  paddy,  vegetables  and  fruits  were  heavily  damaged. Due  to  salinisation  caused  by  tidal  surge,  large  tracts  of  agricultural land  have  turned  infertile.  Large  tracts  of  sal,  teak  and  bamboo plantations  have  disappeared.  The  mangrove  forests  between  Paradeep and  Konark  vanished.  Cold air  Warm air  Cyclonic  Rainfall  Moist air  Relief  (Orographic)  Rainfall  Warm air  Convectional  Rainfall  Fig. 4.5: Types of Rainfall  26 OUR  ENVIRONMENT  Moisture When water evaporates from land and different water bodies, it becomes water vapour. Moisture in the air at any time, is known as humidity. When the air is full of water vapour we call it a humid day. As the air gets warmer, its capacity to  hold  the  water  vapour  increases  and  so  it becomes  more  and  more  humid.  On  a  humid day, clothes take longer to dry and sweat from our body does not evaporate easily, making us feel very uncomfortable.  When the water vapour rises, it starts cooling. The water vapour condenses causing formation of  droplets  of  water.  Clouds  are  just  masses  of such water droplets. When these droplets of water become too heavy to float in air, then they come down as precipitation.  Jet planes flying in the sky leave a white trail behind them. The moisture from their engines condenses.  We  see  trails  of  this  condensed moisture  for  some  time  when  there  is  no  air movement to disturb it.  Precipitation that comes down to the earth in liquid form is called rain. Most of the ground water comes from rainwater. Plants help preserve water. When trees on hill sides are cut, rainwater flows down the bare mountains and can cause flooding  of  low  lying  areas.  On  the  basis  of mechanism, there are three types of rainfall: the convectional rainfall, the orographic rainfall and the cyclonic rainfall (Fig. 4.5).  Rationalised 2023-24Rainfall is very important for the survival of plants and animals.  It  brings  fresh  water  to  the  earth’s  surface.  If rainfall is less – water scacity and drought occur. On the other hand if it is more, floods take place.  Do you know?  Other  forms  of precipitation  are snow,  sleet,  hail.  Exercises  1. Answer the following questions.  (i) What is atmosphere?

Plant the largest  plants  first and  then  arrange  the smaller  ones  around them.  Spray  the arrangement  with water  and  close  the jar.

The  sun’s  heat  causes  evaporation  of  water  into vapour. When the water vapour cools down, it condenses and forms clouds. From there it may fall on the land or sea in the form of rain, snow or sleet.

Waves  are  formed when  winds  scrape across  the  ocean surface.  The  stronger the  wind  blows,  the bigger  the  wave becomes.  Waves When you are playing throw ball on the beach and the ball falls into the water, what happens? It is fun to watch how  the  ball  gets  washed back  to  the  shore  by  the waves. When the water on the surface of the ocean rises and falls  alternately,  they  are called waves.  Fig.  5.4: Fig.  5.4: Fig.  5.4:  Waves Fig.  5.4: Fig.  5.4:  During a storm, the winds blowing at very high speed form  huge  waves.  These  may  cause  tremendous destruction.  An  earthquake,  a  volcanic  eruption  or underwater landslides can shift large amounts of ocean water. As a result a huge tidal wave called tsunami, that may be as high as 15m. is formed. The largest tsunami ever measured was 150m. high. These waves travel at a speed of more than 700 km. per hour. The tsunami of 2004 caused wide spread damage in the coastal areas of India.  The  Indira  point  in  the  Andaman  and  Nicobar islands got submerged after the tsunami.  Do you know?  Tsunami  is  a Japanese  word  that means  “Harbour waves”  as  the harbours  get destroyed  whenever there  is  tsunami.  TSUNAMI – THE EARTH’S PANDEMONIUM  Tsunami  or  the  harbour  wave  struck  havoc  in  the  Indian  Ocean  on  the 26 December 2004. The wave was the result of the earthquake that had its  epicenter  close  to  the  western  boundary  of  Sumatra.  The  magnitude of  the  earthquake  was  9.0  on  the  Richter  scale.  As  the  Indian  plate went  under  the  Burma  plate,  there  was  a  sudden  movement  of  the  sea floor,  causing  the  earthquake.  The  ocean  floor  was  displaced  by  about 10  –  20m  and  tilted  in  a  downwardly  direction.  A  huge  mass  of  ocean water flowed to fill in the gap that was being created by the displacement. This  marked  the  withdrawal  of  the  water  mass  from  the  coastlines  of the  landmasses  in  the  south  and  southeast  Asia.  After  thrusting  of  the Indian plate below the Burma plate, the water mass rushed back towards the  coastline.  Tsunami  travelled  at  a  speed  of  about  800km.  per  hour, comparable to speed of commercial aircraft and completely washed away  34 OUR  ENVIRONMENT  Rationalised 2023-24some of the islands in the Indian ocean. The Indira point in the Andaman and  Nicobar  islands  that  marked  the  southernmost  point  of  India  got completely  submerged.  As  the  wave  moved  from  earthquake  epicenter from  Sumatra  towards  the  Andaman  islands  and  Sri  Lanka  the  wave length  decreased  with  decreasing  depth  of  water.  The  travel  speed  also declined from 700-900km. per hour to less than 70km. per hour. Tsunami waves  travelled  upto  a  depth  of  3  km.  from  the  coast  killing  more  than 10,000  people  and  affected  more  than  lakh  of  houses.  In  India,  the worst  affected  were  the  coastal  areas  of  Andhra  Pradesh,  Tamil  Nadu, Kerala,  Puducherry  and  the  Andaman  and  Nicobar  Islands.  While  the  earthquake  cannot  be  predicted  in  advance,  it  is  possible to  give  a  three-hour  notice  of  a  potential  tsunami.  Such  early  warning systems  are  in  place  across  the  Pacific  ocean,  but  not  in  the  Indian Ocean.  Tsunamis  are  rare  in  the  Indian  Ocean  as  the  seismic  activity is  less  as  compared  to  the  Pacific.  Destruction  caused  by  tsunami  on  Tamil  Nadu  Coast  The tsunami that ravaged the South and South east Asian coasts in December  2004,  is  the  most  devastating  tsunami  in  the  last  several hundred  years.  The  large  damage  caused  to  life  and  property  was primarily  a  result  of  lack  of  monitoring,  the  early  warning  systems  and knowledge  among  the  coast  dwellers  of  Indian  ocean.  The  first  indication  that  tsunami  is  approaching  is  the  rapid withdrawal  of  water  from  the  coastal  region,  followed  by  destructive wave. When this happened on the coast, instead of people going to high ground,  they  started  assembling  at  the  coast  to  view  the  miracle.  As  a consequence  there  was  a  large  casualty  of  curious  onlookers  when  the gigantic  wave  (tsunami)  struck.  Tides The  rhythmic  rise  and  fall  of  ocean  water  twice  in  a day is called a tide. It is high tide when water covers much of the shore by rising to its highest level. It is low tide when water falls to its lowest level and recedes from the shore.

The water of the earth closer to  the  moon  gets  pulled  under t h e   i n f l u e n c e   o f   t h e   m o o n ’ s gravitational force and causes high tide. During the full moon and new moon days, the sun, the moon and the earth are in the same line and the  tides  are  highest.  These  tides are  called  spring  tides.  But  when the  moon  is  in  its  first  and  last quarter, the ocean waters get drawn in diagonally opposite directions by the  gravitational  pull  of  sun  and moon resulting in low tides. These tides are called neap tides (Fig. 5.5). High  tides  help  in  navigation. They raise the water level close to the shores. This helps the ships to arrive  at  the  harbour  more  easily. The high tides also help in fishing. Many more fish come closer to the shore  during  the  high  tide.  This  enables  fishermen to get a plentiful catch. The rise and fall of water due to  tides  is  being  used  to  generate  electricity  in some places.  Earth  Moon  OCEAN CURRENTS Ocean currents are streams of water flowing constantly on the ocean surface in definite directions. The ocean currents  may  be  warm  or  cold  (Fig.  5.6).  Generally, the  warm  ocean  currents  originate  near  the  equator and move towards the poles. The cold currents carry water from polar or higher latitudes to tropical or lower latitudes. The Labrador Ocean current is cold current while the Gulf Stream is a warm current. The ocean current  influence  the  temperature  conditions  of  the area. Warm currents bring about warm temperature over land surface. The areas where the warm and cold currents meet provide the best fishing grounds of the  Rationalised 2023-24Fig. 5.6: Ocean Currents  world.

Notice  that  the  tropical  region  lies  very close to the equator; between 10°N and 10°S. So, it is referred to as the equatorial region. The river Amazon flows through this region. Notice how it flows from the mountains to the west and reaches the Atlantic Ocean to the east.  The  place  where  a  river  flows  into  another  body  of water is called the river’s mouth. Numerous tributaries join the Amazon River to form the Amazon basin. The river basin drains portions of Brazil, parts of Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, Columbia and a small part of Venezuela.  Name the countries of the basin through which the  equator passes.  Do you know?  When  Spanish explorers  discovered the  Amazon  river, they  were  attacked  by a  group  of  local  tribes wearing  headgears and  grass  skirts. These  people reminded  them  of  the fierce  tribes  of  women warriors  known  in ancient  Roman Empire  as  the Amazons.  Hence  the name  Amazon.  Glossary  Tributaries:  These are  small  rivers  that join  the  main  river. The  main  river  along with  all  its  tributaries that  drain  an  area forms  a  river  basin  or the  catchment  area. The  Amazon  Basin  is the  largest  river  basin in  the  world.  40 OUR  ENVIRONMENT  Fig. 6.2: Fig. 6.2: Fig. 6.2: The Amazon Basin in South America Fig. 6.2: Fig. 6.2:  Rationalised 2023-24CLIMATE As you now know, the Amazon Basin stretches directly on the equator and is characterized by hot and wet climate throughout  the  year.  Both  day  and  nights  are  almost equally  hot  and  humid.  The  skin  feels  sticky.  It  rains almost  everyday,  that  too  without  much  warning.  The day temperatures are high with very high humidity. At night  the  temperature  goes  down  but  the  humidity remains high.  RAINFORESTS As it rains heavily in this region, thick forests grow (Fig. 6.3). The forests are in fact so thick that  the  dense  “roof”  created  by  leaves  and branches does not allow the sunlight to reach the ground. The ground remains dark and damp. Only shade tolerant vegetation may grow here. Orchids, bromeliads grow as plant parasites.  The  rainforest  is  rich  in  Fig. 6.3 : The Amazon Forest  Fig. 6.4 : Toucans  fauna. Birds such as toucans (Fig. 6.4), humming  birds,  macaw  with  their brilliantly coloured plumage, oversized bills  for  eating  make  them  different from birds we commonly see in India. These birds also make loud sounds in the  forests.  Animals  like  monkeys, sloth and ant-eating tapirs are found here (Fig. 6.5). Various species of reptiles and snakes also thrive in these jungles. Crocodiles, snakes, pythons abound. Anaconda and boa constrictor are some of the species.  Besides,  the  basin  is  home  to  thousands  of species  of  insects.  Several species of fishes including the flesh-eating  Piranha  fish  is also  found  in  the  river.  This basin  is  thus  extraordinarily rich in the variety of life found there.

Slash and Burn is a way  of  cultivating  land where  farmers  clear  a piece of land by slashing  or  cutting down trees and bushes. These  are  then  burnt, which  releases  the nutrients  into  the  soil. Now crops are grown in this  cleared  field  for  a few  years.  After  repeatedly using  the  patch  of land,  the  soil  looses its  nutrients.  So  it  is abandoned.  Then  they clear  another  plot  of land  to  plant.  In  the mean  time  young trees  grow  in  the  old field.  In  this  way  soil fertility  is  restored. People  can  then return  to  it  and  start cultivating  it  again.  tapioca, pineapple and sweet potato. As hunting and fishing are uncertain it is the women who keep their families alive by feeding them the vegetables they grow. They practice “slash and burn agriculture”. The staple food is manioc, also known as cassava that grows under the ground like the potato. They also eat queen ants and egg sacs. Cash crops like coffee, maize and cocoa are also grown.  The rainforests provide a lot of wood for the houses. Some  families  live  in  thatched  houses  shaped  like beehives.  There  are  other  large  apartment-like  houses called “Maloca” with a steeply slanting roof.  Life  of  the  people  of  the  Amazon  basin  is  slowly changing. In the older days the heart of the forest, could be reached only by navigating the river. In 1970 the Trans Amazon  highway  made  all  parts  of  the  rainforest accessible.  Aircrafts  and  helicopters  are  also  used  for reaching various places. The indigenous population was pushed  out  from  the  area  and  forced  to  settle  in  new areas where they continued to practice their distinctive way of farming.  The developmental activities are leading to the gradual destruction  of  the  biologically  diverse  rainforests.  It  is estimated  that  a  large  area  of  the rainforest has been disappearing annually in the Amazon basin. You  can  see  that  this destruction of forests has a much wider implication (Fig.  6.6).  The  topsoil is  washed  away  as the  rains  fall  and the lush forest turns  into a  barren landscape.  42 OUR  ENVIRONMENT  Fig. 6.6: Gradual Destruction of Forests  Rationalised 2023-24LIFE IN THE GANGA-BRAHMAPUTRA BASIN The tributaries of rivers Ganga and Brahmaputra  together  form  the Ganga-Brahmaputra  basin  in  the Indian  subcontinent  (Fig.  6.8).

Himalayas  and  the  Sundarbans  delta  are  the  main features of this basin. Ox-bow lakes dot the plain area. The  area  is  dominated  by  monsoon  climate.  The monsoon brings rains from mid-June to mid-September. The summers are hot and the winters cool.  Look at the map of India (Fig. 6.8). Find out the states  in which the Ganga-Brahmputra basin lies.  The  basin  area  has  varied  topography.  The environment plays a dominant role in the distribution of the population. The mountain areas with steep slopes have  inhospitable  terrain.  Therefore  less  number  of people  live  in  the  mountain  area  of  the  Ganga- Brahmaputra basin. The plain area provides the most suitable land  for human habitation. The soil is fertile. Agriculture is the main occupation of the people where flat  land  is  available  to  grow  crops.  The  density  of population of the plains is very high. The main crop is paddy  (Fig.  6.9).  Since  cultivation  of  paddy  requires sufficient water, it is grown in the areas where the amount of rainfall is high.  Wheat,  maize,  sorghum,  gram  and  millets  are  the other crops that are grown. Cash crops like sugarcane and jute are also grown. Banana plantations are seen in some areas of the plain. In West Bengal and Assam tea is grown in plantations (Fig. 6.10). Silk is produced through the cultivation of silk worms in parts of Bihar and Assam. In the mountains and hills, where the slopes are gentle, crops are grown on terraces.  The vegetation cover of the area varies according to the type of landforms. In the Ganga and Brahmaputra plain tropical deciduous trees grow, along with teak, sal and  peepal.  Thick  bamboo  groves  are  common  in  the Brahmaputra plain.

It is the world’s largest desert. It has  an  area  of  around  8.54  million sq. km. Do you recall that India has an area of 3.28 million sq. km? The Sahara desert touches eleven countries. These are  Algeria,  Chad,  Egypt,  Libya,  Mali, Mauritania,  Morocco,  Niger,  Sudan, Tunisia and Western Sahara.  When you think of a desert the picture  Fig. 7.1: The Sahara Desert  that immediately comes to your mind is that of sand. But besides the vast stretches of sands, that Sahara desert is covered  with,  there  are  also  gravel  plains  and  elevated plateaus with bare rocky surface. These rocky surfaces may be more than 2500m high at some places.  Rationalised 2023-24Do you know?  You  will  be  surprised to  know  that  present day  Sahara  once  used to be a lush green plain.  Cave  paintings in  Sahara  desert  show that  there  used  to  be rivers  with  crocodiles. Elephants,  lions, giraffes,  ostriches, sheep,  cattle  and goats  were  common animals.  But  the change  in  climate  has changed  it  to  a  very hot  and  dry  region.  Fig. 7.2: Sahara in Africa  Climate The climate of the Sahara desert is scorching hot and parch  dry.  It  has  a  short  rainy  season.  The  sky  is cloudless  and  clear.  Here,  the  moisture  evaporates faster than it accumulates. Days are unbelievably hot. The temperatures during the day may soar as high as 50°C, heating up the sand and the bare rocks, which in turn radiates heat making everything around hot. The  nights  may  be  freezing  cold  with  temperatures nearing zero degrees.  Flora and Fauna Vegetation  in  the  Sahara  desert  includes  cactus,  date palms and acacia. In some places there are oasis – green islands  with  date  palms  surrounding  them.  Camels, hyenas,  jackals,  foxes,  scorpions,  many  varieties  of  Do you know?

Fig. 7.3: Oasis in the Sahara Desert  People The Sahara desert despite its harsh climate has been inhabited  by  various  groups  of  people,  who  pursue different activities. Among them are the Bedouins and Tuaregs.  These  groups  are  nomadic  tribes  rearing livestock  such  as  goats,  sheep,  camels  and  horses. These  animals  provide  them  with  milk,  hides  from which  they  make  leather  for  belts,  slippers,  water bottles;  hair  is  used  for  mats,  carpets,  clothes  and blankets. They wear heavy robes as protection against dust storms and hot winds.  The oasis in the Sahara and the Nile Valley in Egypt supports settled population. Since water is available, the people grow date palms. Crops such as rice, wheat, barley and  beans  are  also  grown.  Egyptian  cotton,  famous worldwide is grown in Egypt.  The  discovery  of  oil  –  a  product  in  great  demand throughout  the  world,  in  Algeria,  Libya  and  Egypt  is constantly  transforming  the  Sahara  desert.  Other minerals of importance that are found in the area include iron, phosphorus, manganese and uranium.  The cultural landscape of the Sahara is undergoing change. Gleaming glass cased office buildings tower over mosques and superhighways crisscross the ancient camel paths.  Trucks  are  replacing  camels  in  the  salt  trade. Tuaregs  are  seen  acting  as  guides  to  foreign  tourists. More and more nomadic herdsmen are taking to city life finding jobs in oil and gas operations.  Do you know?  Scientists  have actually  found skeletons  of  fish  in this  desert.  What could  have  happened?  Do you know?  Depressions  are  formed when  the  wind  blows away the sands.  In  the depressions  where underground  water reaches  the  surface, an  oasis  is  formed. These  areas  are  fertile. People  may  settle around  these  water bodies  and  grow  date palms  and  other crops.  Sometimes  the oasis  may  be abnormally  large. Tafilalet  Oasis  in Morocco  is  a  large oasis  with  an  area  of about 13,000 sq.km.

Drass,  one  of  the coldest  inhabited places  on  earth  is located  in  Ladakh.  THE COLD DESERT - LADAKH Ladakh is a cold desert lying in the Great Himalayas, on the eastern side of Jammu and Kashmir (Fig. 7.4). The Karakoram Range in the north and the Zanskar mountains in the south enclose it. Several rivers flow through  Ladakh,  Indus  being  the  most  important among them. The rivers form deep valleys and gorges. Several glaciers are found in Ladakh, for example the Gangri glacier.  The altitude in Ladakh varies from about 3000m in  Kargil  to  more  than  8,000m  in  the  Karakoram. Due to its high altitude, the climate is extremely cold and  dry.  The  air  at  this  altitude  is  so  thin  that  the heat  of  the  sun  can  be  felt  intensely.  The  day temperatures in summer are just above zero degree and  the  night  temperatures  well  below  –30°C.  It  is freezing cold in the winters when the temperatures may remain below –40°C for most of the time. As it  lies  52 OUR  ENVIRONMENT  Fig. 7.4: Ladakh  Rationalised 2023-24in  the  rain  shadow  of  the  Himalayas,  there  is  little rainfall,  as  low  as  10  cm  every  year.  The  area experiences freezing winds and burning hot sunlight. You  will  be  surprised  to  know  that  if  you  sit  in  the sun with your feet in the shade, you may suffer from both sunstroke and frost bite at the same time.  Flora and Fauna Due to high aridity, the vegetation is sparse. There are scanty  patches  of  grasses  and  shrubs  for  animals  to graze.  Groves  of  willows  and  poplars  are  seen  in  the valleys. During the summers, fruit trees such as apples, apricots and walnuts bloom. Several species of birds are sighted in Ladakh. Robins, redstarts, Tibetan snowcock, raven  and  hoopoe  are  common.  Some  of  these  are migratory birds. The animals of Ladakh are wild goats, wild sheep, yak and special kinds of dogs. The animals are reared to provide for the milk, meat and hides. Yak’s milk is used to make cheese and butter. The hair of the sheep and goat is used to make woollens.  People Do you find any resemblance between the people of Ladakh and the inhabitants of Tibet and Central Asia? The people here are either Muslims or Buddhists. In fact several Buddhists monasteries dot the Ladakhi landscape  with  their  traditional  ‘gompas’.  Some famous  monasteries  are  Hemis,  Thiksey,  Shey  and Lamayuru (Fig. 7.5).  Do you know?  Ladakh  is  also  known as  Khapa-chan  which means  snow  land.  Do you know?  The  Chiru  or  the Tibetan  antelope  is  an endangered  species.  It is  hunted  for  its  wool known as shahtoosh, which  is  light  in weight  and  extremely warm.  Do you know?  The  finest  cricket  bats are  made  from  the wood  of  the  willow trees.  In the summer season the people are busy cultivating barley, potatoes, peas, beans and turnip. The climate in winter  months  is  so  harsh  that people keep themselves engaged in festivities  and  ceremonies.  The women are very hard working. They work  not  only  in  the  house  and fields,  but  also  manage  small business and shops. Leh, the capital of Ladakh is well connected both by road and air. The National Highway 1A  connects  Leh  to  Kashmir Valley through the Zoji la Pass. Can you  name  some  more  passes  in the Himalayas?

Baralacha  la  Tourism  is  a  major activity  with  several tourists streaming in from within India and abroad. Visits  to  the  gompas, treks to see the meadows and  glaciers,  witnessing ceremonies and festivities are important activities.  Life  of  people  is undergoing  change  due to  modernisation.  But the  people  of  Ladakh have over the centuries learned to live in balance and harmony with nature. Due to scarcity of resources like water and fuel, they are used with reverence and care.

The teacher will create a list of desert creatures. The number of the creatures should be same as the number of students in the class. The creatures can be picked up from the categories of mammals, birds and reptiles. Mammals can include – camel, yak, fox, sheep, goat, antelope… Birds – raven, eagle, vulture, turkey… Reptiles  –  snakes  …  Assign  one  desert  creature  to  each  student.  Ask  the  student  to  write  three characteristics of the creature on plain sheet of paper. (students can use index cards of size 10 cm × 15 cm). Questions such as - in what type of deserts it is found? Major adaptation? Use to man?  These characteristics will be used as clues in the guessing game. On the board make three columns – mammals, birs and reptiles. Paste a sheet of paper in the column under the particular category. The class can be divided in three to four groups. They will compete against each other in the ‘desert game’. Each group now takes turn in guessing the correct answer. Explain to the class that they have to guess what animal matches the characteristics listed on the paper. For example:  • Animal of hot desert • Has double set of eyelashes to keep away the sand • The hide is used for making water bottles   The correct answer is ‘camel’. Within the group there will be a student who has prepared the card. That student should not answer. Ten points are awarded for the correct answer.  This game will enable students to understand the desert. You can play the same game by taking different types of fruits, flora and the clothes the people wear.

This principle marks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our system and causes a gap between the  school,  home  and  community.  The  syllabi  and  textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp boundaries between different subject areas. We hope these measures will take us significantly further in the direction  of  a  child-centred  system  of  education  outlined  in  the National Policy on Education (1986).  The  success  of  this  effort  depends  on  the  steps  that  school principals and teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their  own  learning  and  to  pursue  imaginative  activities  and questions. We must recognise that, given space, time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and  initiative  is  possible  if  we  perceive  and  treat  children  as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge. These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in implementing the annual  calendar so that the required number  of  teaching  days  are  actually  devoted  to  teaching.  The methods used for teaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook proves for making children’s life at school a happy  experience,  rather  than  a  source  of  stress  or  boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of curricular burden  by  restructuring  and  reorienting  knowledge  at  different stages with greater consideration for child psychology and the time available  for  teaching.  The  textbook  attempts  to  enhance  this endeavour by giving higher priority and space to opportunities for contemplation  and  wondering,  discussion  in  small  groups,  and activities requiring hands-on experience.  The  National  Council  of  Educational  Research  and  Training (NCERT) appreciates the hard work done by the textbook development committee  responsible  for  this  book.  We  wish  to  thank  the Chairperson  of  the  advisory  committee  for  textbooks  in  Social Sciences, at the higher secondary level, Professor Hari Vasudevan and the Chief Advisor for this book, Vibha Parthasarathi for guiding  Rationalised 2023-24the  work  of  this  committee.

30,30,0,"UNIT ONE  2  Rationalised 2023-24Equality in Indian Democracy  in  people’s  movements  around  various social and economic issues.  Local  situations  should  be  used  as  a practical reference to make the discussion on underlying concepts more relevant and appropriate. A discussion on equality in the classroom requires empathy as well as a firm commitment on the teacher’s part to ensuring that the dignity of all learners be respected.  Teacher’s note  This  Unit  introduces  the  learner  to  the critical role of equality in democracy, with specific reference to India. The Constitution of India guarantees equality to all citizens. Despite  this,  the  daily  lives  of  people  in India  are  far  from  equal.  Earlier discussions on equality in Civics textbooks most often reiterated certain provisions of the  Constitution  without  adequately considering the reality of these in people’s lives. This Unit adopts a different approach. It discusses the need for equality through highlighting the inequalities that continue to be practised and experienced by various communities.  The government’s role in passing laws and instituting policies is discussed to show that commitment  to  the  alleviation  of  existing inequalities is a major part of the work that governments undertake. The chapter also briefly introduces an issue of inequality in the  United  States  of  America  to  highlight that  this  is  a  global  phenomenon  and  a feature of many democratic countries.  This  chapter  aims  to  help  the  learner understand  that  equality  and  democracy are dynamic and not static concepts. This dynamism is reflected in the government’s passing of new laws and programmes, and  3 3  Rationalised 2023-24R E T P A H  1C  Can you think of an incident in your life in which your dignity was  violated? How did this make you feel?  In the 1975 film, Deewar, a boy who works as a shoeshine refuses to pick up a coin  thrown  at  him.  He  feels  that  there is dignity in the work that he does and insists that his fee be given respectfully.  4  Social and Political Life  On Equality  Equality  in  Indian  democracy  The Indian Constitution recognises every person as equal.  This  means  that  every  individual  in  the country,  including  male  and  female  persons  from all castes, religions, tribes, educational and economic backgrounds are recognised as equal. This is not to say  that  inequality  ceases  to  exist.  It  doesn’t.  But atleast,  in  democratic  India,  the  principle  of  the equality  of  all  persons  is  recognised.  While  earlier no law existed to protect people from discrimination and ill-treatment, now there are several that work to see that people are treated with dignity and as equals.  This recognition of equality includes some of the following  provisions  in  the  Constitution:  first  that every person is equal before the law. What this means is that every person, from the President of the country to Kanta, a domestic worker, has to obey the same laws. Second, no person can be discriminated against on  the  basis  of  their  religion,  race,  caste,  place  of birth or whether they are female or male. Third, every person  has  access  to  all  public  places  including playgrounds, hotels, shops and markets. All persons can use publicly available wells, roads and bathing ghats. Fourth, untouchability has been abolished.  Rationalised 2023-24The two ways in which the government has tried to implement the equality that is guaranteed in the Constitution is first through laws and second through government  programmes  or  schemes  to  help disadvantaged communities. There are several laws in India that protect every person’s right to be treated equally. In addition to laws, the government has also set  up  several  schemes  to  improve  the  lives  of communities and individuals who have been treated unequally for several centuries. These schemes are to ensure greater opportunity for people who have not had this in the past.  One of the steps taken by the government includes the  midday  meal  scheme.  This  refers  to  the programme introduced in all government elementary schools to provide children with cooked lunch. Tamil Nadu was the first state in India to introduce this scheme, and in 2001, the Supreme Court asked all state governments to begin this programme in their schools within six months. This programme has had many positive effects. These include the fact that more poor  children  have  begun  enrolling  and  regularly attending  school.  Teachers  reported  that  earlier  The Parliament is the cornerstone of our democracy and we are represented in it through our elected representatives.  Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) www.in.undp.org  Chapter  1:  On  Equality  5  Rationalised 2023-24children would often go home for lunch and then not return to school but now with the midday meal being provided in school, their attendance has improved. Their mothers, who earlier had to interrupt their work to feed their children at home during the day, now no longer need to do so. This programme has also helped reduce caste prejudices because  children of all castes in the school eat this meal together, and in quite a few places, Dalit women have been employed to cook the meal. The midday meal programme also helps reduce the hunger of poor students who often come to school and cannot concentrate because their stomachs are empty.  While government programmes play an important role in increasing equality of opportunity, there is much that still needs to be done. While the midday meal programme has helped increase the enrolment and attendance of poor children in school, there continues to be big differences in our country between schools that the rich attend and those that the poor attend. Even today there are several schools in the country in which  Dalit  children  are  discriminated  against  and treated  unequally.  These  children  are  forced  into unequal  situations  in  which  their  dignity  is  not respected. This is because people refuse to think of them as equal even though the law requires it.  One of the main reasons for this is that attitudes change very slowly. Even though persons are aware that discrimination is against the law, they continue to treat people unequally on the basis of their caste, religion, disability, economic status and because they are women. It is only when people begin to believe that no one is inferior, and that every person deserves to be treated with dignity, that present attitudes can change. Establishing equality in a democratic society is a continuous struggle and one in which individuals as well as various communities in India contribute to and you will read more about this in this book.  Issues  of  equality  in  other  democracies  You are probably wondering whether India is the only democratic country in which there is inequality and  Children being served their midday meal at a government school in Uttarakhand.

The  truth  is  that  in  many  democratic  countries around the world, the issue of equality continues to be the key issue around which communities struggle. So, for example, in the United States of America, the African–Americans whose ancestors were the slaves who  were  brought  over  from  Africa,  continue  to describe their lives today as largely unequal. This, despite the fact that there was a movement in the late  1950s  to  push  for  equal  rights  for  African– Americans.  Prior  to  this,  African–Americans  were treated extremely unequally in the United States and denied  equality  through  law.  For  example,  when travelling by bus, they either had to sit at the back of the bus or get up from their seat whenever a white person wished to sit.  Rosa Parks (1913–2005) was an African–American woman. Tired from a long day at work she refused to give up her seat on a bus to a white man on 1 December 1955. Her refusal that day started a huge agitation against the unequal ways in which African–Americans were treated  and  which  came  to  be  known  as  the  Civil Rights  Movement.  The  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1964 prohibited  discrimination  on  the  basis  of  race, religion  or  national  origin.  It  also  stated  that  all schools would be open to African–American children and  that  they  would  no  longer  have  to  attend  “It is disgraceful to live at the cost of one's  self-respect.  Self-respect  is  the  most vital factor in life. Without it, man is a cipher.  To  live  worthily  with  self- respect,  one  has  to  overcome  difficulties. It is out of hard and ceaseless struggle alone  that  one  derives  strength, confidence  and  recognition.  “Man is mortal. Everyone has to die some  day  or  the  other.  But  one  must resolve to lay down one's life in enriching  the  noble  ideals  of  self-respect and in bettering one's human life... Nothing is more disgraceful for a brave man than to live life devoid of self- respect.”  –  B.R.

However, despite  this,  a  majority  of  African–Americans continue  to  be  among  the  poorest  in  the  country. Most African-American children can only afford to attend government schools that have fewer facilities and poorly qualified teachers as compared to white students who either go to private schools or live in areas where the government schools are as highly rated as private schools.  Challenge of democracy  No  country  can  be  described  as  being  completely democratic.  There  are  always  communities  and individuals trying to expand the idea of democracy and  push  for  a  greater  recognition  of  equality  on existing as well as new issues. Central to this is the struggle for the recognition of all persons as equal and for their dignity to be maintained. In this book you will read about how this issue of equality affects various aspects of our daily lives in democratic India. As  you  read  these  chapters,  think  about  whether the  equality  of  all  persons  and  their  being  able  to maintain their dignity is upheld.  Excerpt from Article 15 of the Indian Constitution  Prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth.  (1) The State shall not discriminate against any citizen on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth or any of them.  (2) No citizen shall, on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth or any of them, be subject to any disability, liability, restriction or condition with regard to –  (a) access to shops, public restaurants, hotels and places of public entertainment;  or  (b) the use of wells, tanks, bathing ghats, roads and places of public resort maintained wholly or partly out of State funds or dedicated to the use of the general public.  8  Social and Political Life  Rationalised 2023-24EXERCISES  1.

We  have  chosen  ‘health’  as  an  example; there  could  have  been  other,  equally important, choices.  Chapter  2  discusses  ‘health’  as  an important issue for people. There are both public  and  private  aspects  of  health provisioning.  Healthcare  in  India  is  not available  to  all.  While  the  Constitution supports a view that the right to health is an  aspect  of  our  fundamental  rights,  its provisioning  is  rather  unequal.  Through the accounts provided, learners will begin to  visualise  the  ideal  or  desired  role  of government, and the meanings behind its structures.  Some  ways  in  which  this situation  can  be  changed  are  also discussed.  Chapter  3  focuses  on  how  the government functions, and discusses ideas of  representation,  accountability  and  public welfare. Though both the executive and  the  legislature  are  presented,  one should not expect students to retain fine distinctions. It would be best to patiently encourage them to ask questions such as, “Who is the most powerful person?”, “Why can’t  the  MLA  solve  the  problem?”,  etc. Such queries will enable them to construct a sense of the government apparatus.  It is important that learners acquire the confidence to express their views on public issues  and  understand  the  role  of government through the exercises given in the  chapters.  You  could  choose  familiar issues  such  as  water,  transport,  school- fees, books, child-labour, etc., for them to discuss and arrive at how these problems need to be tackled. Allow them to express these ideas through wall charts. Given that discussions  on  the  government  and  its functioning  often  lead  to  boredom  and cynicism,  we  need  to  be  able  to  make the  classroom  session  less  didactic  and more  interactive  while  teaching  these lessons.  11 11  Rationalised 2023-24R E T P A H  2C  12  Role of the Government in Health In a democracy people expect the government to work for their welfare. This could be through the provision of education, health, employment, housing or the development of roads, electricity etc. In this chapter we shall examine the meanings and problems related to health. Look at the sub-headings of this chapter. In what ways do you think this topic is related to the work of government?  Rationalised 2023-24What  is  health?  We can think of health in many ways. Health means our ability to remain free of illness and injuries. But health  isn’t  only  about  disease.  You  may  have associated only some of the situations in the above collage with health. What we often ignore is the fact that each of the above situations is related to health. Apart from disease, we need to think of other factors that affect our health. For example, if people get clean drinking water or a pollution free environment they are likely to be healthy. On the other hand, if people do  not  get  adequate  food  to  eat  or  have  to  live  in cramped conditions, they will be prone to illness.  All of us would like to be active and in good spirits in whatever we may be doing. It isn’t healthy to be dull, inactive, anxious or scared for long stretches of time. We all need to be without mental strain. All of these various aspects of our lives are a part of health.  Would you associate all or some of  these pictures with ‘health’ ? In what ways? Discuss in groups.  Pick two situations from the above  collage that are not related to illness and write two sentences on  how they are related to health.

Compare and contrast the situation expressed in the first and second columns.  India has the largest number of medical colleges in the world and is among the largest producers of doctors. Approximately  more  than  30,000  new  doctors qualify is every year.  Most doctors settle in urban areas. People in rural areas have to travel long distances to reach a doctor.  The number of  doctors  with  respect  to  the  population much less in rural areas.  Healthcare facilities have grown substantially over the years. In 1950, there  were  only  2,717  government  hospitals in India. In 1991, there were 11,174 hospitals. In 2017, the number grew to 23,583.  About five lakh people die from tuberculosis every year.  This number is almost unchanged  since  Independence! Almost two million cases of malaria are reported every year and this number isn’t decreasing.  India gets a large number of medical tourists from many countries. They come for treatment in some of the hospitals in India that compare with the best in the world.  We are not able to provide clean drinking water to all. 21per cent of all  communicable diseases are water borne.  For example, diarrhoea, worms, hepatitis, etc.  India is the third largest producer of medicines in the world and is also a large exporter of medicines.  Half of all children  in India do not get  adequate food to eat and are undernourished.  In India, it is often said that we are unable to provide health  services for all because the government does not have enough  money and facilities. After reading the above left hand column, do  you think this is true? Discuss.    In  order  to  prevent  and  treat  illnesses  we  need appropriate  healthcare  facilities  such  as  health centres,  hospitals,  laboratories  for  testing, ambulance  services,  blood  banks,  etc.,  that  can provide the required care and services that patients need. In order to run such facilities we need health workers, nurses, qualified doctors and other health professionals  who  can  advice,  diagnose  and  treat illnesses. We also need the medicines and equipment that  are  necessary  for  treating  patients.  These facilities are required to take care of us.  14 Social and Political Life  Rationalised 2023-24Patients usually have to wait in long queues  in  government  hospitals,  like this one.  India has a large number of doctors, clinics and hospitals.  The  country  also  has  considerable experience  and  knowledge  in  running  a  public healthcare system. This is a system of hospitals and health  centres  run  by  the  government.  It  has  the ability to look after the health of a large section of its population scattered over hundreds of thousands of villages. We will go into more detail on this later. Moreover,  there  has  been  a  phenomenal advancement in medical sciences whereby many new technologies and treatment procedures are available in the country.  However, the second column points out how poor the health situation in our country is. With all the above positive developments we are not able to provide proper  healthcare  facilities  to  people.  This  is  the paradox  –  something  that  is  contrary  to  what  we would expect. Our country has the money, knowledge and  people  with  experience  but  cannot  make  the necessary healthcare available to all. In this chapter, we will look at some of the reasons for this.

While Ranjan comes from a well-to-do family, Aman’s parents have to struggle to make ends meet...  I had viral fever and had to go to the hospital...  Hi Aman! Good to see you back! How have you been?  Oh! Me, too! I just got back to school on Monday. My Daddy took me to see the doctor at the new hospital in Kingsway. It was very exciting!  The building looked so posh. I thought it was a five star hotel! Daddy said that was because it was a private hospital, with the best of facilities.  Daddy had to pay Rs 500 at the reception counter itself – before we even met the doctor! There was nice music playing and everything was really clean and  shiny.  The doctor asked for many tests...but everyone was so friendly! The lady who took my blood for testing told me so many jokes that I forgot to feel the pain!  After the test results came, we went back to the doctor. He looked through them and said everything was fine, and I only had viral fever. He prescribed some medicines and rest.  ...and  have  you heard  the  one about  Batman on  Reality TV?  ...and so young man – this pink pill should be taken three times a day, and the white tablet once before bed time – that’s for the bodyache! This one is a syrup – don’t worry, it’s tasty  16 Social and Political Life  Thank you Doctor...I feel better already!  Rationalised 2023-24You see, I’ve been dying to tell you all about it! But what about you? Which hospital did  you go to?  ...and it really did! We went to a big Government Hospital. We had to wait in a long queue at the OPD counter. I was feeling so sick that I had to lean on Abba all the time!  Um...it wasn’t as nice as your’s at all! At first, Abba didn’t want to take me because he said it would take too much time...  When our turn came, the doctor examined me, and asked for a blood test. Then we had to go and stand in another long queue! People were crowding around in the testing room too.  We got the test results after three days...and went back to the hospital. There was a different doctor that day.  Show me his OPD card...and the test results – quickly please!  He seems to be suffering from a bout of viral fever – nothing to worry about.  All he needs is this one fever-reducing medicine.  My hospital was nice, but they gave me many medicines and the whole thing cost quite a lot!  Oh! My treatment did not cost much!  17  Rationalised 2023-24Where do you go when you are ill? Are there any problems that you face? Write a paragraph based on your experience.  What problems did Aman face in the government hospital? How do you think the hospital can work in a better manner? Discuss.  Public and private health care services  From  the  above  story,  you  must  have  understood that we can roughly divide up various health care facilities in two categories –  (a) Public health services and  (b) Private health facilities.  Why did Ranjan have to spend so much money? Give reasons.  Public health services  What problems do we face in private hospitals? Discuss.  Why pay taxes to the government?  Government uses tax money for providing many public services for the benefit of all citizens. Some services such as defence, police, judicial system, highways etc. benefit all citizens. Otherwise, the citizens cannot organise these services for themselves.  Taxes fund developmental programmes and services such as education, health care, employment, social welfare, vocational training etc. required for needy citizens. Tax money is utilised for relief and rehabilitation in case of natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, tsunami etc. Space, nuclear, and missile programmes are also funded from the revenues collected as taxes.  Government provides some services especially for the poor who cannot afford to purchase them from the market. One example is health care. Can you give other examples?  The public health service is a chain of health centres and hospitals run by the government. They are linked together  so  that  they  cover  both  rural  and  urban areas and can also provide treatment to all kinds of problems – from common illnesses to special services. At  the  village  level  there  are  health  centres  where there is usually a nurse and a village health worker. They are trained in dealing with common illnesses and  work  under  the  supervision  of  doctors  at  the Primary Health Centre (PHC). Such a centre covers many villages in a rural area. At the district level is the District Hospital that also supervises all the health centres. Large cities have many government hospitals such  as  the  one  where  Aman  was  taken  and  also specialised government hospitals.  The  health  service  is  called  ‘public’  for  many reasons. In order to fulfil its commitment of providing health  care  to  all  citizens,  the  government  has established these hospitals and health centres. Also, the  resources  needed  to  run  these  services  are obtained from the money that we, the public, pay to the government as taxes. Hence, such facilities are meant  for  everyone.  One  of  the  most  important aspects of the public health system is that it is meant to provide quality health care services either free or at  a  low  cost,  so  that  even  the  poor  can  seek treatment.  Another  important  function  of  public health  is  to  take  action  to  prevent  the  spread  of diseases  such  as  TB,  malaria,  jaundice,  cholera,  18 Social and Political Life  Rationalised 2023-24diarrhoea,  chikungunya,  etc.  This  has  to  be organised by the government with the participation of people otherwise it is not effective. For example, when taking up a campaign to see that mosquitoes do  not  breed  in  water  coolers,  rooftops,  etc.,  this has to be done for all houses in the area.  According  to  our  Constitution,  it  is  the  primary duty of the government to ensure the welfare of the people and provide health care facilities to all.  The government must safeguard the Right to Life of every person. If a hospital cannot provide timely medical  treatment  to  a  person,  it  means  that  this protection of life is not being given.  The  Court  also  said  that  it  was  the  duty  of  the government to provide the necessary health services, including  treatment  in  emergency  situations. Hospitals and medical staff must fulfil their duty of providing  the  necessary  treatment.  Therefore,  the Court asked the State Government to give him the money that he had spent on his treatment.  Private  health  facilities  There is a wide range of private health facilities that exist in our country. A large number of doctors run their  own  private  clinics.  In  the  rural  areas,  one finds Registered Medical Practitioners (RMPs). Urban areas have a large number of doctors, many of them providing  specialised  services.  There  are  hospitals and nursing homes that are privately owned. There are many laboratories that do tests and offer special facilities  such  as  X-ray,  ultrasound,  etc.  There  are also shops from where we buy medicines.  As  the  name  suggests,  private  health  facilities are  not  owned  or  controlled  by  the  government. Unlike  the  public  health  services,  in  private facilities,  patients  have  to  pay  a  lot  of  money  for every service that they use.  A  doctor  in  a  rural  health  care  centre giving medicines to a patient.  A woman and her sick child at a government  hospital.  According  to UNICEF, more than a million children die  every  year  in  India  from  preventable infections.  In what ways is the public health system meant for everyone?  List some Primary Health Centres  (PHCs) or hospitals near your place. From your experience (or by  visiting any one of them), find out the facilities provided and people  who run the centre.  Chapter 2: Role of the Government in Health  19  Rationalised 2023-24Today the presence of private facilities can be seen all  around.  In  fact  now  there  are  large  companies that  run  hospitals  and  some  are  engaged  in manufacturing and selling medicines. Medical shops are found in every corner of the country.  Healthcare and equality: Is adequate healthcare available to all?  In India, we face a situation where private services are increasing but public services are not. What is then available to people are mainly private services. These are concentrated in urban areas. The cost of these  services  is  rather  high.  Medicines  are expensive. Many people cannot afford them or have to  borrow  money  when  there  is  an  illness  in  the family.  Some  private  services  encourage  incorrect practices  to  earn  more.  At  times  inexpensive alternatives, though available, may not be used. For example,  some  medical  practitioners  are  found  to prescribe superfluous medicines, injections or saline when simple medication may suffice.   In fact, barely 20 per cent of the population can afford all the medicines that they require during an illness. Hence, even for those whom one might not  A  post-operative  room  in  a  leading private  hospital  in  Delhi.  Private health facilities can mean many things. Explain with the help  of some examples from your area.  The  Medical  Council  of  India’s  Code  of  Medical  Ethics  states:  “Every physician should, as far as  possible,  prescribe  drugs  with  generic names and he/she shall  ensure  that  there  is  a  rational  prescription and use of drugs.”  How can health care be made more affordable? Discuss.  20 Social and Political Life 20 Social and Political Life  Rationalised 2023-24think  as  being  poor,  medical  expenses  cause hardship.  It  was  reported  in  a  study  that  40  per cent  of  people  who  are  admitted  to  a  hospital  for some illness or injury have to borrow money or sell some of their possessions to pay for the expenses.  For those who are poor, every illness in the family is a cause of great anxiety and distress. What is worse is  that  this  situation  tends  to  happen  again  and again.  Those  who  are  poor  are  in  the  first  place undernourished.  These  families  are  not  eating  as much as they should. They are not provided basic necessities  like  drinking  water,  adequate  housing, clean  surroundings,  etc.,  and  therefore,  are  more likely to fall ill. The expenses on illness make their situation even worse.  Sometimes  it  is  not  only  the  lack  of  money  that prevents  people  from  getting  proper  medical treatment. Women, for example, are not taken to a doctor  in  a  prompt  manner.  Women’s  health concerns are considered to be less important than the health of men in the family. Many tribal areas have few health centres and they do not run properly. Even private health services are not available.  What can be done?  There is little doubt that the health situation of most people  in  our  country  is  not  good.  It  is  the responsibility of the government to provide quality healthcare services to all its citizens, especially the poor and the disadvantaged. However, health is as much  dependent  on  basic  amenities  and  social conditions  of  the  people,  as  it  is  on  healthcare services. Hence, it is important to work on both in order to improve the health situation of our people. And this can be done. Look at the following example.  In  rural  areas,  a  jeep  is  often  used  to serve  as  a  mobile  clinic  for  patients.  This pregnant lady has to travel many kilometres  to  see  a  qualified  doctor.

Forty per cent of the entire state budget  was  given  to  panchayats.  They  could  plan and  provide  for  their  requirements.  This  made  it possible  for  a  village  to  make  sure  that  proper planning  was  done  for  water,  food,  women’s development and education. This meant that water supply schemes were checked, the working of schools and anganwadis was ensured and specific problems of  the  village  were  taken  up.  Health  centres  were also  improved.  All  of  this  helped  to  improve  the situation.  Despite  these  efforts,  however,  some problems  –  such  as  shortage  of  medicines, insufficient  hospital  beds,  not  enough  doctors  – remained, and these needed to be addressed.  For more details, visit http://lsgkerala.gov.in/en  Let us look at an example of another country and  its approach to issues of health.  The Costa Rican approach  Costa Rica is considered to be one of the healthiest countries in Central America. The main reason for this can be found in the Costa Rican Constitution. Several years ago, Costa Rica took a very important decision  and  decided  not  to  have  an  army.  This helped  the  Costa  Rican  government  to  spend  the money that the army would have used, on health, education and other basic needs of the people. The Costa Rican government believes that a country has to be healthy for its development and pays a lot of attention to the health of its people. The Costa Rican government  provides  basic  services  and  amenities to  all  Costa  Ricans.  For  example,  it  provides  safe drinking  water,  sanitation,  nutrition  and  housing. Health education is also considered very important and knowledge about health is an essential part of education at all levels.  The above map of India shows the state of Kerala in pink.

Can you explain the following terms–majority, ruling party,  opposition with reference to your state.  government.  In  this  way  we  say  that  the  MLAs represent  people.  The  example  below  will  help  us understand this better.  Every  state  in  India  has  a  Legislative  Assembly. Each  state  is  divided  into  different  areas  or constituencies. For example, look at the map below. It shows that the state of Himachal Pradesh is divided into  68  assembly  constituencies.  From  each constituency, the people elect one representative who then becomes a Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA). You would have noticed that people stand for elections in the name of different parties. These MLAs, therefore, belong to different political parties.  How do people who are MLAs become ministers or chief  minister?  A  political  party  whose  MLAs  have won more than half the number of constituencies in a state can be said to be in a majority. The political party that has the majority is called the ruling party and all other members are called the opposition. For example,  the  Legislative  Assembly  of  the  state  of Himachal Pradesh has 68 MLA constituencies.

Since the total number of MLAs in the Legislative Assembly is  68,  a  political  party  would  have  needed  to  have more than 34 MLAs in order to gain a majority. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) with 44 MLAs had the majority and it became the ruling party. All other MLAs became the opposition. In this case, the Indian National Congress (INC) was the major opposition party, since it had the largest number of MLAs after the BJP. Among the opposition were other parties, including those who had been elected as independent candidates.  After  the  elections,  the  MLAs  belonging  to  the ruling party will elect their leader who will become the chief minister. In this case, the BJP MLAs chose Shri Jairam Thakur as their leader and he became the  chief  minister.  The  chief  minister  then  selects other people as ministers. After the elections, it is the  Governor  of  the  state  who  appoints  the  chief minister and other ministers.  The  chief  minister  and  other  ministers  have  the responsibility  of  running  various  government departments or ministries. They have separate offices. A Legislative Assembly is a place where all the MLAs, whether from the ruling party or from the opposition meet  to  discuss  various  things.  Hence,  some  MLAs have  dual  responsibilities:  one  as  an  MLA  and  the other as a minister. We will read about this further.  Construct a table, similar to the one given for Himachal Pradesh,  for your state.  The Head of the State is the Governor. She/He is appointed by the Central Government to ensure that the State Government works within the rules and regulations of the Constitution. Find out the name of Governor of your State.  At times, the ruling party may not be a single party but a group of  parties working together. This is called a coalition. Discuss with  your teacher.

The children were excited. After security checks, they were taken upstairs. There was a  gallery  from  where  they  could  see  the  large  hall below. There were rows and rows of desks.   This Assembly was going to have a debate on a current problem. During this time, MLAs can express their opinions and ask questions related to the issue or give suggestions about what should be done by the government. Those who wish to, can respond to this. The minister then replies to the questions and tries to assure the Assembly that adequate steps are being taken.    The  chief  minister  and  other  ministers  have  to take decisions and run the government. We usually hear about them or see them in the news channels or  in  the  papers.  However,  whatever  decisions  are being taken have to be approved by the members of the  legislative  assembly.  In  a  democracy,  these members  can  ask  questions,  debate  an  important issue, decide where money should be spent, etc. They have the main authority.  MLA  1:  In  my  constituency  of  Akhandagaon, during the last three weeks, there were 15 deaths because of diarrhoea. I think it is a shame that this government has not been able to check the situation of a simple problem like diarrhoea while proclaiming itself to be a champion of technology. I would call the attention of the minister in charge of health to take immediate measures to control the situation.  MLA  2:  My  question  is  why  are  government hospitals  in  such  a  bad  situation?  Why  is  the government not appointing proper doctors and other medical staff in the district? I would also like to know how the government plans to deal with this situation  28 Social and Political Life 28 Social and Political Life  Rationalised 2023-24which is affecting a large number of people and is also spreading. This is an epidemic.  MLA  3:  My  constituency  of  Tolpatti  too  has  a serious shortage of water. Women travel up to 3 or 4 kilometres to collect water. How many tankers have been  put  into  service  to  supply  water?  How  many wells and ponds have been cleaned and disinfected?  MLA 4: I think my colleagues are exaggerating the problem. The government has taken steps to control the  situation.  Water  tankers  have  been  put  into service.  ORS  packets  are  being  distributed.  The government  is  doing  everything  possible  to  help people.  MLA 5: We have very poor facilities in our hospitals. There are hospitals that do not have a doctor and no medical  staff  has  been  appointed  for  the  last  few years. In another hospital, the doctor has gone on a long leave. This is a shame. I think the situation is going  from  bad  to  worse.  How  are  we  going  to ensure  that  ORS  packets  reach  all  families  in  the affected areas?  MLA 6: The opposition members are unnecessarily blaming the government. The previous government did not pay any attention to sanitation. We have now taken up a drive to clear the garbage that has been lying around for years.  1  Can you identify the MLAs of the ruling party and the opposition in  the illustration?

The  members  were debating  the  action  taken  or  not  taken  by  the government. This is because the MLAs are together responsible  for  the  work  of  the  government.  In common  usage  the  word  ‘government’  refers  to government departments and various ministers who head them. The overall head is the chief minister. More  correctly,  this  is  called  the  executive  part  of the government. All the MLAs who gather together (assemble) in the legislative assembly are called the Legislature.  They  are  the  ones  who  authorise  and supervise their work. As we saw in the earlier section, it is from among them that the head of the executive, or the chief minister is formed.  Working of the government  The Legislative Assembly is not the only place where opinions  are  expressed  about  the  work  of  the government and action is demanded. You will find newspapers,  TV  channels  and  other  organisations regularly  talking  about  the  government.  In  a democracy,  there  are  various  ways  through  which people express their views and also take action. Let us look at one such way.  Soon after the discussion in the assembly, there was  a  press  conference  organised  by  the  health minister.  Large  numbers  of  people  from  different newspapers  were  present.  The  minister  and  some government officials were also present. The minister explained  the  steps  the  government  had  taken. Reporters  asked  many  questions  at  this  meeting. These  discussions  were  then  reported  in  different newspapers. The following page has one such report.  During the next week, the chief minister and the minister for health visited Patalpuram district. They went to visit the families who had lost their relatives and  also  visited  people  in  the  hospitals.  The government  announced  a  compensation  for  these  What were the main arguments put forward by different MLAs  who thought that the government was not taking the situation in a  serious manner?  If you were the health minister, how would you respond to the  above discussion?  Do you think the above debate would have been useful in some  ways? How? Discuss.  In the working of the government, explain the difference between  being an MLA and an MLA who is also a minister.  30 Social and Political Life  Rationalised 2023-24Write two measures that the goverment undertook for  controlling diarrhoea?  What is the purpose of a press conference? How does  the press conference help you get information on what the  goverment is doing?  Government  smells  the  garbage Chief Minister promises funds for work  Patalpuram  |  Ravi  Ahuja  During the last few weeks, there  have  been  many deaths in some districts of our state. There has been a strong  reaction  that  the government has not taken this  seriously.  The  health minister explained today at a press conference that his government has asked all the collectors and the chief medical  officers  to  take urgent measures. The most important problem is that of  drinking  water.  The minister  said  that  they  intend  to  supply  drinking water  to  every  village through  tanker  trucks. The  chief  minister  has promised  funds  for  this work.  They  also  plan  to start a campaign to inform people about the steps that can  be  taken  to  prevent diarrhoea. When a reporter asked him as to what steps are being taken to see that garbage that has been lying around  for  months  is quickly collected, the chief minister said that he would look into this.  families. The chief minister also said that he thought the problem was not only one of sanitation but also of a lack of clean drinking water. He said that a high- level  enquiry  committee  will  be  asked  to  look  into the needs of the district to provide sanitation facilities and would request the minister for Public Works to take care of the needs of proper water supply in the region.  As  you  saw  above,  the  people  in  power  like  the chief minister and the minister have to take action. They  do  so  through  various  departments  like  the Public  Works  Department,  the  Agriculture Department, the Health Department, the Education Department  and  so  on.  They  also  have  to  answer questions that are asked in the Legislative Assembly and convince people asking the questions that proper steps are being taken. At the same time, newspapers and  the  media  widely  discuss  the  issue  and  the government has to respond, for example, by holding the press conferences.  Chapter 3: How the State Government Works  31  Rationalised 2023-24 The government can also decide to make new laws for the state regarding sanitation and health facilities. For  example,  it  may  make  it  compulsory  for municipal  corporations  to  ensure  that  there  are adequate  toilets  in  every  urban  area.  It  may  also ensure  that  a  health  worker  is  appointed  in  every village. This act of making laws on certain issues is done in the Legislative Assembly of each state. The various  government  departments  then  implement these laws. Laws for the entire country are made in the  Parliament.  You  will  read  more  about  the Parliament next year.  In  a  democracy,  it  is  the  people  who  elect  their representatives  as  Members  of  the  Legislative Assembly (MLAs) and, thus, it is the people who have the main authority. The ruling party members then form  the  government  and  some  members  are appointed ministers. These ministers are in charge of various departments of the government such as health in the above example. Whatever work is done by  these  departments  has  to  be  approved  by  the members of the legislative assembly.  In a democracy, people organise meetings to voice their opinions and protest against the government.

The  following  photographs  explain  the  different aspects  involved  in  creating  a  wallpaper  in  a classroom.  After introducing the topic and having a brief discussion with the whole class, the teacher divides the class into groups. The group discusses the issue and decides what it would like to include in the wall-paper. Children then work individually or in pairs to read the collected material and write their observations or experiences. They can do this through creating stories, poems, case studies, interviews, etc.  Find out with the help of your  teacher, the work done by the government departments  mentioned above, and fill in the table.  The group looks at the material that they have selected, drawn or written. They read each other’s writing and provide feedback to each other. They make decisions on what should be included and finalise the layout for the wallpaper.  Chapter 3: How the State Government Works  33  Rationalised 2023-24Each group then presents the wallpaper to the entire class. It is important that more than one member of the group is asked to present and that each group is allotted the same amount of time to discuss their work. After each group has presented, it would be a good idea to have a feedback session on the following – What more could they do on their own? How could their work be organised better? How could writing and presentation be improved upon?  This wallpaper about the 2006 dengue epidemic was prepared by children of Class VI B of Kendriya Vidyalaya II, Hindon, Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh.

33,33,0,"UNIT THREE  Rationalised 2023-24Gender  Teacher’s note  Gender is a term that you may often have heard.  It  is  a  term,  however,  that  is  not easily  understood.  It  tends  to  remain distant  from  our  lives  and  restricted  to discussions during training programmes. In  fact,  it  is  something  that  all  of  us experience in our lives on a daily basis. It determines, for example, who we are and what we will become, where we can go and where not, the life choices available to us and  those  we  eventually  make.  Our understanding of gender is often based on the family and society that we live in. This leads us to think that the roles we see men and women around us play are fixed and natural.  In  fact,  these  roles  differ  across communities around the world. By gender, then, we mean the many social values and stereotypes  our  cultures  attach  to  the biological distinction ‘male’ and ‘female’. It is a term that helps us to understand many of  the  inequalities  and  power  relations between men and women in society.  The  following  two  chapters  explore  the concept of gender without actually using the  term.  Instead,  through  different pedagogic tools like case studies, stories, classroom  activities,  data  analysis  and photographs, students are encouraged to question and think about their own lives and  the  society  around  them.  Gender  is often mistakenly thought to be something that concerns women or girls alone. Thus, care has been taken in these chapters to draw boys into the discussion as well.  Chapter 4 uses two case studies, situated in  different  places  and  points  in  time  to show how girls and boys are brought up or socialised differently. This enables them to  understand  that  the  process  of socialisation  is  not  uniform;  instead  it  is socially  determined  and  changes continuously over time. The chapter also addresses  the  fact  that  societies  assign different  values  to  the  roles  men  and women play and the work they do, which becomes  a  basis  for  inequality  and discrimination.  Through  a  storyboard, students discuss the issue of housework. Done  primarily  by  women,  housework  is often not considered ‘work’ and, therefore made invisible and devalued.   Chapter 5 further develops ideas around gender inequalities in the world of work and describes  women’s  struggles  for  equality. Through  a  classroom  activity,  students begin  questioning  existing  stereotypes regarding  work  and  career  choices.  The chapter also points out that opportunities like education are not equally available to boys and girls. By reading about the lives of  two  Indian  women,  from  the  ninteenth and twentieth centuries, students see how women  struggled  to  change  their  lives  by learning  to  read  and  write.  Change  on  a large  scale  usually  takes  place  through collective struggles. The chapter concludes with a photo-essay that gives examples of different strategies the women’s movement has used to fight for change.  37  Rationalised 2023-24R E T P A H  4C  Growing up as Boys and Girls Being a boy or a girl is an important part of one’s identity. The society we grow up in teaches us what kind of behaviour is acceptable for girls and boys, what boys and girls can or cannot do. We often grow up thinking that these things are exactly the same everywhere. But do all societies look at boys and girls in the same way? We will try and answer this question in this chapter. We will also look at how the different roles assigned to boys and girls prepare them for their future roles as men and women. We will learn that most societies value men and women differently. The roles women play and the work they do are usually valued less than the roles men play and the work they do. This chapter will also examine how inequalities between men and women emerge in the area of work.  Rationalised 2023-24Growing up in Samoa in the 1920s  The Samoan Islands are part of a large group of small islands in the southern part of the Pacific Ocean. In the 1920s, according to research reports on Samoan society,  children  did  not  go  to  school.  They  learnt many things, such as how to take care of children or do  household  work  from  older  children  and  from adults. Fishing was a very important activity on the islands. Young people, therefore, learnt to undertake long fishing expeditions. But they learnt these things at different points in their childhood.  As  soon  as  babies  could  walk,  their  mothers  or other  adults  no  longer  looked  after  them.  Older children, often as young as five years old, took over this responsibility. Both boys and girls looked after their younger siblings. But, by the time a boy was about  nine  years  old,  he  joined  the  older  boys  in learning  outdoor  jobs  like  fishing  and  planting coconuts. Girls had to continue looking after small children  or  do  errands  for  adults  till  they  were teenagers. But, once they became teenagers they had much more freedom. After the age of fourteen or so, girls  also  went  on  fishing  trips,  worked  in  the plantations, learnt how to weave baskets. Cooking was done in special cooking-houses, where boys were supposed to do most of the work while girls helped with the preparations.  Growing up male in Madhya Pradesh in the 1960s  The  following  is  adapted  from  an  account  of experiences  of  being  in  a  small  town  in  Madhya Pradesh in the 1960s.  A Class VII Samoan child in his school uniform.  In what ways do the experiences  of Samoan children and teenagers differ from your own experiences  of growing up? Is there anything in this experience that you wish  was part of your growing up?  From  Class  VI  onwards,  boys  and  girls  went  to separate schools. The girls’ school was designed very differently from the boys’ school. They had a central courtyard where they played in total seclusion and  Why do girls like to go to school together  in  groups?

Show  the different kinds of activities young boys and girls may be  engaged in. You could do this individually or in groups.  Are there as many girls as boys in  your drawing? Most probably you would have drawn fewer girls. Can  you think of reasons why there are fewer women and girls in your  neighbourhood streets, parks and markets in the late evenings or at  night?  Are girls and boys doing different activities? Can you think of  reasons why this might be so? What would happen if you  replaced the girls with the boys and  vice-versa?  safety from the outside world. The boys’ school had no such courtyard and our playground was just a big space attached to the school. Every evening, once school was over, the boys watched as hundreds of school  girls  crowded  the  narrow  streets.  As  these girls walked on the streets, they looked so purposeful. This was unlike the boys who used the streets as a place to stand around idling, to play, to try out tricks with their bicycles. For the girls, the street was simply a place to get straight home. The girls always went in groups, perhaps because they also carried fears of being teased or attacked.  After reading the two examples above, we realise that  there  are  many  different  ways  of  growing  up. Often we think that there is only one way in which children  grow  up.  This  is  because  we  are  most familiar with our own experiences. If we talk to elders in our family, we will see that their childhoods were probably very different from ours.  We  also  realise  that  societies  make  clear distinctions between boys and girls. This begins from a very young age. We are for example, given different toys to play with. Boys are usually given cars to play with and girls dolls. Both toys can be a lot of fun to play with. Why are girls then given dolls and boys cars? Toys become a way of telling children that they will have different futures when they become men and women. If we think about it, this difference is created  in  the  smallest  and  most  everyday  things. How girls must dress, what games boys should play, how girls need to talk softly or boys need to be tough. All these are ways of telling children that they have specific roles to play when they grow up to be men and women. Later in life this affects the subjects we can study or the careers we can choose.  In most societies, including our own, the roles men and women play or the work they do, are not valued equally.  Men  and  women  do  not  have  the  same status. Let us look at how this difference exists in the work done by men and women.  40 Social and Political Life 40 Social and Political Life  Rationalised 2023-24‘MY MOTHER DOES NOT WORK’  Ma, we are going on a school excursion.

You know that Jaspreet aunty is up at 5 a.m. everyday doing all the housework!  Yes, but that’s not real work, it’s just house work!  Oh! That’s what you think, do you? Let’s go over to their house and ask Jaspreet what she thinks!  At the Singh’s house  Harsharan, Shonali thinks that your wife is not a working person!  But isn’t that correct aunty? My mother is a housewife – she does not work!  Then Jaspreet, why don’t you just relax and let them manage everything for a change?  Great idea! OK, I’ll go on strike tomorrow!  What fun! We’ll take care of everything tomorrow – with Papa!  Ha, ha!  Next morning, 7:30 a.m.  Oh God! Look at the time! Where’s my breakfast? Why aren’t the children ready?  Oh-ho! That’s the school bus! I’ll have to drop them in the car.  Hurry, hurry! And ask Harmeet to switch on the pump!  H O N K  HONK  How would I know? I’m on strike, remember?

Oh, I forgot...your strike...I’ll make some myself.  The house looks like it was hit by a hurricane!

I wonder if they still believe I don’t work?...and now I have to remind them that Chachaji and Chachiji are coming for dinner.  Valuing housework  Harmeet’s family did not think that the work Jaspreet did within the house was real work. This feeling is not unique to their families. Across the world, the main responsibility for housework and care-giving tasks,  like  looking  after  the  family,  especially children,  the  elderly  and  sick  members,  lies  with women. Yet, as we have seen, the work that women do within the home is not recognised as work. It is also  assumed  that  this  is  something  that  comes naturally to women. It, therefore, does not have to be paid for. And society devalues this work.  42 Social and Political Life  Rationalised 2023-24Lives of domestic workers  In the story above, Harmeet’s mother was not the only one who did the housework. A lot of the work was  done  by  Mangala,  their  domestic  helper. Many  homes,  particularly  in  towns  and  cities, employ domestic workers. They do a lot of work – sweeping  and  cleaning,  washing  clothes  and dishes, cooking, looking after young children or the elderly. Most domestic workers are women. Sometimes, even young boys or girls are employed to do this work. Wages are low, as domestic work does not have much value. A domestic worker’s day can begin as early as five in the morning and end as late as twelve at night! Despite the hard work they do, their employers often do not show them  much  respect.  This  is  what  Melani,  a domestic worker had to say about her experience of working in Delhi – “My first job was with a rich family  that  lived  in  a  three-storeyed  house.  The memsahib was very strange as she would shout to get any work done. My work was in the kitchen. There were two other girls who did the cleaning. Our  day  would  begin  at  5  o’clock.  For  breakfast we would get a cup of tea and two dry rotis. We could never get a third roti. In the evening, when I  cooked  the  food,  the  two  other  girls  would  beg me  to  give  them  an  extra  roti.  I  would  secretly give it to them and make an extra one for myself. We were so hungry after working through the day! We could not wear chappals in the house. In the winter,  our  feet  would  swell  up  with  the  cold.  I used to feel scared of the memsahib but also felt angry and humiliated. Did we not work all day? Did  we  not  deserve  to  be  treated  with  some respect?”  In fact, what we commonly term as housework actually involves many different tasks. A number of  these  tasks  require  heavy  physical  work.  In both rural and urban areas women and girls have to  fetch  water.  In  rural  areas  women  and  girls carry  heavy  headloads  of  firewood.  Tasks  like  Melani with her daughter.  Were Harmeet and Shonali correct  in saying that Harmeet’s mother did not work?  What do you think would happen  if your mother or those involved in doing the work at home went  on a strike for a day?  Why do you think that men and boys generally do not do  housework? Do you think they should?  Chapter 4: Growing up as Boys and Girls  43  Rationalised 2023-24washing clothes, cleaning, sweeping and picking up loads  require  bending,  lifting  and  carrying.  Many chores, like cooking, involve standing for long hours in  front  of  hot  stoves.  The  work  women  do  is strenuous and physically demanding — words that we normally associate with men.  Another aspect of housework and care-giving that we do not recognise is that it is very time consuming. In fact, if we add up the housework and the work, women  do  outside  the  home,  we  find  that  women spend much more time working than men and have much less time for leisure.  Below  is  some  data  from  a  special  study  done by  the  Central  Statistical  Organization  of  India (1998–1999). See if you can fill in the blanks.

What are the total number of work hours spent by women in Haryana  and Tamil Nadu each week?  How does this compare with the total number of work hours spent  by men?  Many women like Shonali’s mother in the story and the women in Tamil Nadu and Haryana who were surveyed work both inside and outside the home. This is often referred to as the double burden of women’s work.  44 Social and Political Life  Women’s work and equality  As we have seen the low value attached to women’s household and care-giving work is not an individual or  family  matter.  It  is  part  of  a  larger  system  of inequality  between  men  and  women.  It,  therefore, has to be dealt with through actions not just at the level of the individual or the family but also by the government.  As  we  now  know,  equality  is  an important  principle  of  our  Constitution.  The Constitution says that being male or female should not become a reason for discrimination. In reality, inequality between the sexes exists. The government is, therefore, committed to understanding the reasons for  this  and  taking  positive  steps  to  remedy  the situation. For example, it recognises that burden of child-care and housework falls on women and girls.  Rationalised 2023-24Children at an Anganwadi centre in a village in Madhya Pradesh.  This naturally has an impact on whether girls  can  attend  school.  It  determines whether  women  can  work  outside  the house and what kind of jobs and careers they can have. The government has set up anganwadis or child-care centres in several villages  in  the  country.  The  government has passed laws that make it mandatory for organisations that have more than 30 women  employees  to  provide  crèche facilities.  The  provision  of  crèches  helps many  women  to  take  up  employment outside the home. It also makes it possible for more girls to attend schools.

Housework is time consuming.  Write  in  your  own  words  what  is  meant  by  the  terms  ‘invisible’,  ‘physically  demanding’,  and  ‘time  consuming’? Give  one  example  of  each  based  on  the  household  tasks  undertaken by women in your home.  3. Make a list of toys and games that boys typically play and  another for girls. If there is a difference between the two lists, can you think of some reasons why this is so? Does  this have any relationship to the roles children have to play as adults?  4.  If you have someone working as a domestic help in your house or locality talk to her and find out a little bit more  about her life – Who are her family members?  Where is her home?  How many hours does she work?  How much  does she get paid?  Write a small story based on these details.  Glossary  Identity: Identity is a sense of self-awareness of who one is. Typically, a person can have several  identities. For example, a person can be a girl, a sister and a musician.  Double-burden: Literally means a double load. This term is commonly used to describe the women’s  work situation. It has emerged from a recognition that women typically labour both inside the home (housework) and outside.  Care-giving: Care-giving refers to a range of tasks related to looking after and nurturing. Besides physical tasks, they also involve a strong emotional aspect.  De-valued: When someone is not given due recognition for a task or job they have done, they can feel de-valued. For example, if a boy has put in a lot of effort into making a special birthday gift for  his friend and this friend does not say anything about this, then the boy may feel de-valued.

We also read how doing household work and taking care of family members is a full time job and there are no specific hours at which it begins or ends. In this chapter, we will look at work outside the home, and understand how some occupations are seen to be more suitable for men than for women. We will also learn about how women struggle for equality. Getting an education was, and still is, one way in which new opportunities were created for women. This  chapter will also briefly trace the different types of efforts made by the women’s movement to challenge discrimination in more recent  years.  48 Social and Political Life  Rationalised 2023-24Who  does  what  work?

The reason they did this is because they feel that outside the home too, women are good at only certain jobs. For example, many people believe that women make better  nurses  because  they  are  more  patient  and gentle.  This  is  linked  to  women’s  roles  within  the family. Similarly, it is believed that science requires a technical mind and girls and women are not capable of dealing with technical things.  Because  so  many  people  believe  in  these stereotypes, many girls do not get the same support that boys do to study and train to become doctors and  engineers.  In  most  families,  once  girls  finish school, they are encouraged by their families to see marriage as their main aim in life.  Breaking stereotypes  Engine drivers are men. But 27-year-old Laxmi Lakra, from a poor tribal family in Jharkhand has begun to change things. She is the first woman engine driver for Northern Railways.  Laxmi’s  parents  are  not  literate  but  they  struggled  and overcame many hardships to make sure their children got an education. Laxmi studied in a government school. Even in school, Laxmi helped with the housework and did odd jobs. She studied hard  and  did  well  and  then  went  on  to  get  a  diploma  in electronics. She then took the railway board exam and passed it on her first attempt.  Laxmi says, “I love challenges and the moment somebody says it is not for girls, I make sure I go ahead and do it.”  Laxmi has had to do this several times in her life – when she wanted to take electronics; when she rode motorcycles at the polytechnic; and when she decided to become an engine driver.  Her philosophy is simple – “As long as I am having fun without harming anyone, as long as I am doing well and helping my parents,  why should I not lead a lifestyle of my choice?”  (Adapted  from  Driving  Her Train  by  Neeta  Lal, Women’s  Features  Service)  Chapter 5: Women Change the World  51  Rationalised 2023-24Read the story below and answer  the questions –  If you were Xavier, what subject would you choose and why?  In your experience, what are some  of the other pressures that boys experience?  It  is  important  to  understand  that  we  live  in  a society in which all children face pressures from the world around them. Sometimes, these come in the form of demands from adults. At other times, they can  just  be  because  of  unfair  teasing  by  our  own friends. Boys are pressurised to think about getting a job that will pay a good salary. They are also teased and  bullied  if  they  do  not  behave  like  other  boys. You may remember that in your Class VI book you read about how boys at an early age are encouraged not to cry in front of others.  Xavier was happy with the results of his Class X board exams. Though his marks in Science and Maths were not high, he had done well in his favourite subjects – History and Languages.

As  more  and  more  children  enter  school every year, we begin to think that it is normal for all children to go to school. Today, it is difficult for us to imagine that school and learning could be seen as  “out  of  bounds”  or  not  appropriate  for  some children.  But  in  the  past,  the  skill  of  reading  and writing was known to only a few. Most children learnt the work their families or elders did. For girls, the situation was worse. In communities that taught sons to read and write, daughters were not allowed to learn the  alphabet.  Even  in  families  where  skills  like pottery,  weaving  and  craft  were  taught,  the contribution of daughters and women was only seen as  supportive.  For  example,  in  the  pottery  trade, women  collected  the  mud  and  prepared  the  earth for the pots. But since they did not operate the wheel, they were not seen as potters.  In the nineteenth century, many new ideas about education  and  learning  emerged.  Schools  became more  common  and  communities  that  had  never learnt  reading  and  writing  started  sending  their children to school. But there was a lot of opposition to educating girls even then. Yet many women and men made efforts to open schools for girls. Women struggled to learn to read and write.  Ramabai (1858–1922), shown above with her daughter, championed the cause of women’s education. She never went to school but learnt to read and write from her parents. She was given the title ‘Pandita’ because she could read and write Sanskrit, a remarkable achievement as women then were not allowed such knowledge. She went on to set up a Mission in Khedgaon near Pune in 1898, where widows and poor women were encouraged not only to become literate but to be independent. They were taught a variety of skills from carpentry to running a printing press, skills that are not usually taught to girls even today. The printing press can be seen in the picture on the top left corner. Ramabai’s Mission is still active today.  Chapter 5: Women Change the World  53  Rationalised 2023-24Learning to read and write led some women to question the situation of women in society. They wrote stories, letters and autobiographies describing their own experiences of inequality. In their writings, they also imagined new ways of thinking and living for both men and women.  Let us read about the experience of Rashsundari Devi  (1800–1890),  who  was  born  in  West  Bengal, some 200 years ago. At the age of 60, she wrote her autobiography in Bangla. Her book titled Amar Jiban is the first known autobiography written by an Indian woman. Rashsundari Devi was a housewife from a rich landlord’s family. At that time, it was believed that if a woman learnt to read and write, she would bring bad luck to her husband and become a widow! Despite this, she taught herself how to read and write in secret, well after her marriage.  “I would start working at dawn, and I would still be at it until well beyond midnight. I had no rest in between. I was only fourteen years old at the time. I came  to  nurture  a  great  longing:  I  would  learn  to read and I would read a religious manuscript. I was  Rokeya Sakhawat Hossain and her dreams about ‘Ladyland’  Rokeya Sakhawat Hossain (1880 –1932) was born into a rich family who owned a lot of land.  Though she knew how to read and write Urdu, she was stopped from learning Bangla and English. In those days, English was seen as a language that would expose girls to new ideas, which people thought were not correct for them. Therefore, it was mostly boys who were taught English. Rokeya learnt to  read  and  write  Bangla  and  English  with  the  support  of  her  elder  brother  and  an  elder sister.    She  went  on  to  become  a  writer.  She  wrote  a  remarkable  story  titled Sultana’s Dream in 1905 to practise her English skills when she was merely 25 years old. This story imagined a woman called Sultana who reaches a place called Ladyland. Ladyland is a place where women had the freedom to study, work,  and  create  inventions  like  controlling  rain  from  the  clouds  and flying air cars. In this Ladyland, the men had been sent into seclusion – their aggressive guns and other weapons of war defeated by the brain- power of women. As Sultana travels in Ladyland with Sister Sarah, she awakes to realise that she was only dreaming.  As  you  can  see,  Rokeya  Sakhawat  Hossain  was  dreaming  of women  flying  planes  and  cars  even  before  girls  were  being allowed to go to school! This was the way in which education and learning had changed Rokeya’s own life.  Rokeya did not stop at getting education just for herself. Her education gave her the power not only to dream and write, but also to do more – to help other girls go to school and to build their own dreams.  In 1910, she started a school for girls in Kolkata, and to this day, the school is still functioning.  54 Social and Political Life  Rationalised 2023-24unlucky, in those days women were not educated. Later, I began to resent my own thoughts. What is wrong with me? Women do not read, how will I do it? Then I had a dream: I was reading the manuscript of Chaitanya Bhagabat (the life of a saint)… Later in the day, as I sat cooking in the kitchen, I heard my husband say to my eldest son: “Bepin, I have left my Chaitanya Bhagabat here. When I ask for it, bring it in.” He left the book there and went away. When the book  had  been  taken  inside,  I  secretly  took  out  a page and hid it carefully. It was a job hiding it, for nobody must find it in my hands. My eldest son was practising  his  alphabets  at  that  time.  I  hid  one  of them  as  well.  At  times,  I  went  over  that,  trying  to match letters from that page with the letters that I remembered.  I  also  tried  to  match  the  words  with those  that  I  would  hear  in  the  course  of  my  days. With  tremendous  care  and  effort,  and  over  a  long period of time, I learnt how to read…”  After learning the alphabet, Rashsundari Devi was able to read the Chaitanya Bhagabat. Through her own writing she also gave the world an opportunity to  read  about  women’s  lives  in  those  days. Rashsundari  Devi  wrote  about  her  everyday  life experiences  in  details.  There  were  days  when  she did  not  have  a  moment’s  rest,  no  time  even  to  sit down and eat!  Schooling and education today  Today,  both  boys  and  girls  attend  school  in  large numbers.  Yet,  as  we  will  see,  there  still  remain differences between the education of boys and girls. India has a census every 10 years, which counts the whole  population  of  the  country.  It  also  gathers detailed  information  about  the  people  living  in India – their age, schooling, what work they do, and so  on.  We  use  this  information  to  measure  many things, like the number of literate people, and the ratio  of  men  and  women.  According  to  the  1961 census,  about  40  per  cent  of  all  boys  and  men  Unlike Rashsundari Devi and Rokeya Hossain, who were not allowed to learn to read and write, large numbers of girls attend school in India today. Despite this, there continue to be many girls who leave school for reasons of poverty, inadequate schooling facilities and discrimination. Providing equal schooling facilities to children from all communities and class backgrounds, and particularly girls, continues to be a challenge in India.

In the most recent census of 2011, these figures have grown to 82 per cent for boys and men, and 65 per cent for girls and women. This means that the proportion of both men and women who are now able to read and have at least some amount of schooling has increased. But, as  you  can  also  see,  the  percentage  of  the  male group is still higher than the female group. The gap has not gone away.  Here is a table that shows the percentage of girls and  boys  who  leave  schools  from  different  social groups  including  Scheduled  Caste  (SC)  and Scheduled Tribe (ST).

At which level of education do you  see the highest percentage of children leaving?  Why do you think that the  percentage of Adivasi girls and boys leaving school is higher than  that of any other group?  Source: Educational Statistics at a Glance, MHRD, 2018  You have probably noticed in the above table that SC and ST girls leave school at a rate that is higher than the category ‘All Girls’. This means that girls who are from Dalit (SC) and Adivasi (ST) backgrounds are less likely to remain in school. The 2011 census also found that Muslim girls are less likely, than SC and  ST  girls,  to  complete  primary  school.  While  a Muslim  girl  is  likely  to  stay  in  school  for  around three  years,  girls  from  other  communities  spend around four years in school.  There are several reasons why children from Dalit, Adivasi  and  Muslim  communities  leave  school.

There are other spheres – like legal reform, violence and health – where the situation of women and  girls  has  improved.  These  changes  have  not happened  automatically.  Women  individually,  and collectively  have  struggled  to  bring  about  these changes.  This  struggle  is  known  as  the  Women’s Movement.  Individual  women  and  women’s organisations from different parts of the country are part of the movement. Many men support the women’s movement as well. The diversity, passion and efforts of those involved makes it a very vibrant movement. Different  strategies  have  been  used  to  spread awareness,  fight  discrimination  and  seek  justice. Here are some glimpses of this struggle.  Chapter 5: Women Change the World  57  Rationalised 2023-24Campaigning  Campaigns  to  fight  discrimination and  violence  against  women  are  an important  part  of  the  women’s movement. Campaigns have also led to new laws being passed. A law was made in 2006 to give women who face physical and mental violence within their  homes,  also  called  domestic violence, some legal protection.  Similarly,  efforts  made  by  the women’s movement led the Supreme Court to formulate guidelines in 1997 to  protect  women  against  sexual harassment  at  the  workplace  and within educational institutions.  In the 1980s, for example, women’s groups across the country spoke out against  ‘dowry  deaths’  — cases  of young brides being murdered by their in-laws or husbands, greedy for more dowry.  Women’s  groups  spoke  out against  the  failure  to  bring  these cases  to  justice.  They  did  so  by coming on to the streets, approaching the  courts,  and  by  sharing information. Eventually, this became a public issue in the newspapers and society,  and  the  dowry  laws  were changed to punish families who seek dowry.  Satyarani, an active member of the women’s movement, sitting on the steps of the Supreme Court surrounded by legal files gathered during the course of a long legal battle to seek justice for her daughter who was murdered for dowry.

Their message has been spread through street plays, songs and public meetings.  Protesting  The women’s movement raises its voice when violations against women take place or for  example,  when  a  law  or  policy  acts  against  their  interests.

If you had to  organise  a  struggle  against  stereotypes,  about  what women can or cannot do, what method would you employ  from the ones that you have read about? Why would you choose this particular method?  Glossary  Stereotype: When we believe that people belonging to particular groups based on religion, wealth,  language are bound to have certain fixed characteristics or can only do a certain type of work, we create a stereotype. For example, in this chapter, we saw how boys and girls are made to take  certain subjects not because he or she has an aptitude for it, but because they are either boys or girls. Stereotypes prevent us from looking at people as unique individuals.  Discrimination:  When  we  do  not  treat  people  equally  or  with  respect  we  are  indulging  in discrimination. It happens when people or organisations act on their prejudices. Discrimination  usually takes place when we treat some one differently or make a distinction.  Violation: When someone forcefully breaks the law or a rule or openly shows disrespect, we can  say that he or she has committed a violation.  Sexual  harassment:  This  refers  to  physical  or  verbal  behaviour  that  is  of  a  sexual  nature  and  against the wishes of a woman.

This  Unit  offers  some  ways  by which we can begin to think about these.  The  focus  is  on  explaining  the  strong links between media and technology and media and big business.  It explains how the  media  ‘sets  the  agenda’  through influencing  our  perception  of  issues worth  devoting  time  and  attention  to, a n d   i s s u e s   t h a t   a r e   n e g l e c t e d   o r overridden.  Chapter  6  foregrounds  the  widespread effects  of  the  media,  and  attempts  to connect the issues under discussion to the learner’s  own  lives.    At  the  end  of  the chapter, we expect the learner to recognise the  role  of  big  business  in  the  media coverage  of  events  —  the  way  ‘news’  is selected  for  coverage,  and  the  explicit/ implicit  dimensions  of  that  coverage.  We use  two  fictitious  news  reports  to  demonstrate that there is seldom just one version of a story or an event.  Building on this, we expect the learner to develop the skills  required  to  critically  analyse  a newspaper  report  or  a  TV  story  through scrutinising the information provided, as well as understanding the logic behind the exclusion of certain perspectives.  These  ideas  can  be  strengthened  by selecting  from  actual advertisements  and  structuring  similar questions around them.  examples   This  chapter  concludes  by  linking  its contents  to  the  idea  of  democracy.    It emphasises,  through  using  examples  of local  media  as  well  as  social  advertising, how  mainstream  media  and  advertising tend  to  favour  those  who  have  greater financial as well as social resources. This point  can  be  reinforced  in  the  classroom by using local examples of media stories, as well as posing questions about the ways in  which  advertising  is  changing  what  is locally available as well as locally valued.  63  Rationalised 2023-24R E T P A H  6C  Understanding Media  What is your favourite TV programme?

Because media refers to all means of communication, everything ranging from a phone call to the evening news on TV can be called media. TV, radio and newspapers are a form of media that reaches millions of people, or the masses, across the country and the world and, thus, they are called mass media.  Media and technology  It would probably be difficult for you to imagine your life without the media. But cable television and the widespread  use  of  the  Internet  is  a  recent phenomenon. These have been around for less than twenty years. The technology that mass media uses keeps changing.  Newspapers,  television  and  radio  can  reach millions  of  people  because  they  use  certain technologies.  We  also  tend  to  discuss  newspapers and magazines as the print media; and TV and radio as  the  electronic  media.  Why  do  you  think newspapers  are  called  print  media?  As  you  read further, you will find that this naming is related to the different technologies that these media use. The following  photographs  will  give  you  a  sense  of  the ways in which technology that mass media uses has changed over the years and continues to change.  Changing  technology,  or  machines,  and  making technology more modern, helps media to reach more people. It also improves the quality of sound and the images that you see. But technology does more than this. It also changes the ways in which we think about our lives. For example, today it is quite difficult for us to think of our lives without television. Television has enabled us to think of ourselves as members of a larger global world. Television images travel huge  Look at the collage on the left and  list six various kinds of media that you see.

This allows us to view news and entertainment channels from other parts of the world. Most of the cartoons that you see on television are mostly from Japan or the United States. We can now be sitting in Chennai or Jammu and can see images of a storm that has hit the coast of Florida in the United States. Television has brought the world closer to us.  With electronic typerwriters, journalism underwent a sea-change in the 1940s.  Media and money  The different technologies that mass media use are expensive. Just think about the TV studio in which the newsreader sits – it has lights, cameras, sound recorders, transmission satellites, etc., all of which cost a lot of money.  In  a  news  studio,  it  is  not  only  the  newsreader who  needs  to  be  paid  but  also  a  number  of  other people  who  help  put  the  broadcast  together.  This includes those who look after the cameras and lights. Also, as you read earlier the technologies that mass media use keep changing and so a lot of money is spent on getting the latest technology. Due to these costs, the mass media needs a great deal of money to do its work. As a result, most television channels and newspapers are part of big business houses.  Mass media is constantly thinking of ways to make money.  One  way  in  which  the  mass  media  earns money  is  by  advertising  different  things  like  cars, chocolates,  clothes,  mobile  phones,  etc.  You  must have noticed the number of advertisements that you have to see while watching your favourite television show.  While  watching  a  cricket  match  on  TV,  the same advertisements are shown repeatedly between each over and so you are often watching the same image over and over again. As you will read in the following chapter, advertisements are repeated in the hope that you will go out and buy what is advertised.  John L. Baird sits in front of the apparatus with which he demonstrated to the Royal Institute, his invention, the ‘televisor’, an early television.  Can you list three different  products that are advertised during your favourite TV  programme?  Take a newspaper and count the number of advertisements in it.  Some people say that newspapers have too many advertisements. Do  you think this is true and why?  66 Social and Political Life  Rationalised 2023-24Media and democracy  In a democracy, the media plays a very important role in providing news and discussing events taking place in the country and the world. It is on the basis of  this  information  that  citizens  can,  for  example, learn how government works. And often, if they wish to, they can take action on the basis of these news stories. Some of the ways in which they can do this is  by  writing  letters  to  the  concerned  minister, organising  a  public  protest,  starting  a  signature campaign,  asking  the  government  to  rethink  its programme, etc.  Given the role that the media plays in providing information, it is important that the information be balanced.  Let  us  understand  what  we  mean  by  a balanced  media  report  by  reading  two  versions  of the same news event given on the next page.  The cost to advertise on a TV channel varies from ` 1,000 to ` 1,00,000 per 10 seconds depending on the popularity of the channel and time.  The print media offers a large variety of information to suit the tastes of different readers.  Chapter 6: Understanding Media  67  Rationalised 2023-24News of India Report Crackdown  on  polluting  factories Protestors block roads and disrupt traffic Radhika  Malik  |  INN Violent protests by owners and  workers  brought  the city  to  a  standstill  today. People  getting  to  work could  not  do  so  on  time because  of  huge  traffic jams.  The  owners  and workers are protesting the government’s  decision  to close  down  polluting factory units. Although the government  did  take  this decision rather hastily, the protestors have known for quite some time that their legal. units  are  not   Moreover  the  levels  of pollution in the city will be greatly  reduced  by  this closure.  Mr.  Jain  a  well- known  figure  in  the  city said,  “With  our  city becoming gradually  Indias’s new business hub, it is important that it be a clean  and  green  city. Polluting  factories  should be  moved.  The  factory owners  and  workers the should  relocation being offered by the government instead of protesting.”  accept   Daily News Service  India Daily Report Closure of factories causes unrest The  closure  of  one  lakh  factories  in  the city’s residential areas is likely to become a serious issue. On Monday, thousands of factory owners and workers took to the streets to strongly protest  this  closure.  They  said  that  their livelihoods would be lost. They say that the fault lies with the municipal corporation because it continued to issue licenses for new factories to be set up in residential areas.They also say that there were no adequate relocation efforts. The owners and workers plan a one-day city bandh to protest against this closure. Mr. Sharma, one of the factory owners said, “The government says that it has done a lot to relocate us. But the areas they have sent us to have no facilities and have not been developed for the last five years.”  Are the above stories in the two newspapers similar? And if not,  why not? What, in your view, are the similarities and the  differences?  If you read the story in the News of India, what would you think  about the issue?  The fact is that if you had read either newspaper you  would  only  know  one  side  of  the  story.  If  you had read the News of India, you would most likely think  of  the  protestors  as  a  nuisance.  Their disrupting traffic and continually polluting the city with their factories leaves you with a bad impression about them. But on the other hand, if you had read the  story  in  the  India  Daily,  you  would  know  that the protests are because a lot of livelihoods will be lost if the factories close because the relocation efforts have not been adequate. Neither of these stories is a balanced  report.  A  balanced  report  is  one  that discusses all points of view of a particular story and then leaves it to the readers to make up their minds.  Writing a balanced report, however, depends on the media being independent. An independent media means that no one should control and influence its coverage of news. No one should tell the media what  68 Social and Political Life  Rationalised 2023-24can be included and what should not be included in a news story. An independent media is important in a democracy. As you read above, it is on the basis of the information that the media provides that we take action  as  citizens,  so  it  is  important  that  this information is reliable and not biased.  However,  the  reality  is  that  media  is  far  from independent. This is mainly because of two reasons. The first is the control that the government has on the media. When the government prevents either a news item, or scenes from a movie, or the lyrics of a song from being shared with the larger public, this is referred to as censorship. There have been periods in Indian history when the government censored the media.  The  worst  of  these  was  the  Emergency between 1975–1977.  Do you think it is important to know both sides of the story?  Why?  Pretend that you are a journalist for a newspaper and write a  balanced story from the two news reports.  What does TV do to us and what can we do with TV?  In many of our homes, TV is on a lot of the time. In many ways, a lot of our impressions about the world around us are formed by what we see on TV: it is like a ‘window on the world’. How do you think it influences us? TV has different types of programmes, soap operas, like Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi, game shows, like Kaun Banega Crorepati, reality TV shows like Big Boss, news, sports and cartoons. Before, in between and after each programme are advertisements. Since TV time costs so much money, only those programmes that can attract the maximum number of viewers are shown. Can you think of what such programmes might be? Think of what are the kinds of things that TV shows and what it does not. Does it show us more about the lives of the rich or the poor?  We need to think about what TV does to us, how it shapes our views of the world, our beliefs, attitudes and values. We need to realise that it gives us a partial view of the world. While we  enjoy  our  favourite  programmes,  we  should  always  be  aware  of  the  large  exciting world beyond our TV screens. There is so much happening out there that TV ignores.  A world beyond film stars, celebrities and rich lifestyles, a world that all of us need to reach out  to  and  respond  to  in  various  ways. We  need  to  be  active  viewers,  who  question whatever we see and hear, while we may enjoy it too!  Chapter 6: Understanding Media  69  Rationalised 2023-24  While  the  government  does  continue  to  censor films, it does not really censor the media’s coverage of news. Despite the absence of censorship by the government, most newspapers nowadays still fail to provide  a  balanced  story.  The  reasons  for  this  are complicated. Persons who research the media have said  that  this  happens  because  business  houses control the media. At times, it is in the interest of these  businesses  to  focus  on  only  one  side  of  the story. Media’s continual need for money and its links to  advertising  means  that  it  becomes  difficult  for media to be reporting against people who give them advertisements. Media is, thus, no longer considered independent because of its close links to business.  Besides the above, the media also tends to focus on a particular aspect of a story because they believe this makes the story interesting. Also, if they want to increase public support for an issue, they often do this by focusing on one side of a story.  Setting agendas  The media also plays an important role in deciding what stories to focus on, and therefore, decides on what  is  newsworthy.  For  example,  the  annual function at your school is unlikely to make the news. But if a famous actor is invited as the Chief Guest, then the media might be interested in covering it. By focusing on particular issues, the media influences our thoughts, feelings and actions, and brings those issues  to  our  attention.  Due  to  the  significant influence  it  plays  in  our  lives  and  in  shaping  our thoughts, it is commonly said that the media ‘sets the agenda’.  Very  recently,  the  media  drew  our  attention  to alarming  levels  of  pesticides  in  cola  drinks.  They published  reports  that  indicated  the  high  level  of pesticides and, thus, made us aware of the need to regularly  monitor  these  colas  according  to international quality and safety standards. They did  70 Social and Political Life  Rationalised 2023-24this  despite  the  government’s  resistance  by  boldly declaring  that  colas  were  unsafe.  In  covering  this story,  the  media  positively  helped  us  focus  on  an issue that affects our lives and one that we might not even have been aware of it had it not been for media reporting.  There are several instances when the media fails to focus on issues that are significant in our lives. For example, drinking water is a major problem in the country. Every year, thousands of people suffer and die because they do not get safe drinking water. However, we seldom find the media discussing this issue. A well-known Indian journalist wrote of how the Fashion Week, in which clothes designers show their new creations to rich people, formed the front page headlines of all the newspapers while several slums were being demolished in Mumbai, the very same week, and this was not even noticed!  As citizens of a democracy, the media has a very important  role  to  play  in  our  lives  because  it  is through the media that we hear about issues related  Local media  Recognising that the media will not be interested in covering ‘small’ issues that involve ordinary people and their daily lives, several local groups have come forward to start their own media. Several people use community radio to tell farmers about the prices of different crops and advise them on the use of seeds and fertilisers. Others make documentary films with fairly cheap and easily  available  video  cameras  on  real-life  conditions faced by different poor communities, and, at times, have even given the poor these video cameras to make films on their own lives.  Fashion shows are very popular with the media.  What is the consequence of the media ‘setting the agenda’ by  reporting on the Fashion Week rather than the slum demolitions?  Can you think of an issue that  does not seem important to you because it is never featured in the  media?  Another example is a newspaper called Khabar Lahriya which is a fortnightly that is run by eight Dalit women in Chitrakoot district in Uttar Pradesh. Written in the local language, Bundeli, this eight-page newspaper reports on Dalit issues and cases of violence against women and political corruption. The newspaper reaches farmers, shopkeepers, panchayat members, school teachers and women who have recently learnt to read and write.  Chapter 6: Understanding Media  71  Rationalised 2023-24to the working of the government. The media decides what to focus on and in this way it ‘sets the agenda’. The  government  can,  at  times,  prevent  the  media from publishing a story and this is called censorship. Nowadays, media’s close relationship with business often means that a balanced report is difficult to come by. Given this, it is important for us to be aware that the ‘factual information’ that a news report provides is  often  not  complete  and  can  be  one-sided.  We, therefore,  need  to  analyse  the  news  by  asking  the following  questions:  what  is  the  information  I  am learning from this report? What information is not being  provided?  From  whose  point  of  view  is  the article being written? Whose point of view is being left out and why?  Social advertising  Social  advertisements refer  to  advertisements made by the Government or private agencies that have a larger message for society. The following is a social advertisement regarding crossing of manned/unmanned level  crossings.  72 Social and Political Life  Rationalised 2023-24EXERCISES  1.

While  some  of  these  processes may  be  visible  and,  therefore,  easily observable, there are also others that are relatively unfamiliar.  Chapter  7  discusses  ‘Markets  Around Us’. At one level, we study different market sites:  a  weekly  market,  neighbourhood shops, a shopping complex, etc. At another level,  we  explore  the  intricate  question, ‘how  do  goods  reach  these  markets?’  We examine how a chain of markets operates and the role of wholesale markets within this, through the case study of a wholesale vegetable  market.  We  usually  associate ‘market’ with marketplaces, but buying and selling takes place in diverse ways and the chapter  discusses  how  all  of  this  falls within a larger understanding of markets.  Chapter  8  looks  at  how  markets  offer people different opportunities. This is done through the ‘story of a shirt’, and the chain  of markets involved in the process. Together with  understanding  each  step  of  the manufacture and circulation of a shirt, we realise that some people stand to gain in the market transaction whereas others do not  gain  as  much,  or  none  at  all.  The opportunities are highly unequal. Ways do exist,  such  as  those  of  cooperative marketing,  which  can  provide  a  better return to the producers. However, we need to  find  many  more  viable  avenues  for equitable distribution.  These  chapters  offer  an  opportunity  of bringing in the experience of local markets for discussion in the classroom. A visit to a  wholesale  market  would  be  of  interest, and would allow the learner to find out the profit margins and details of daily earnings so that those inequalities can be directly examined. The experiences of markets are varied  and  also  quite  rich.  Hence,  one should  allocate  time  for  some  questions, not addressed in the text, which students may wish to discuss.  75  Rationalised 2023-24R E T P A H  7C  Markets Around Us  We go to the market to buy many things – vegetables, soap, toothpaste, masala, bread, rice, dal, clothes, notebooks, biscuits, etc. If we make a list of the goods that we purchase, it would be really long. There are many kinds of markets that we may visit for our everyday needs: these can include shops, hawker’s stalls in our neighbourhood, a weekly market, a large shopping complex, perhaps even a mall. In this chapter, we look at some of these markets and try to understand how the goods that are sold there reach buyers, who these buyers are, who these sellers are, and the sorts of problems they face.  76 Social and Political Life  Rationalised 2023-247777  Rationalised 2023-24Why do people go to a weekly market? Give three reasons.  Weekly market  Who are the sellers in a weekly  market? Why don’t we find big business persons in these  markets?  Why are things cheap in the weekly market?  Explain with an example how  people bargain in the market. Can you think of a situation where the  bargain would be unfair?  Sameer: Seller of clothes  Sameer is a small trader in the weekly market.  He  buys  clothes  from  a  large trader in the town and sells them in six different  markets  in  a  week.  He  and other cloth sellers move in groups. They hire a mini van for this. His customers are  from  villages  that  are  near  the marketplace. At  festival  times,  such  as during  Deepavali  or  Pongal,  he  does good business.  78 Social and Political Life  A weekly market is so called because it is held on a specific day of the week. Weekly markets do not have permanent shops. Traders set up shops for the day and then close them up in the evening.  Then they may set up at a different place the next day. There are thousands of such markets in India. People come here for their everyday requirements.  Many  things  in  weekly  markets  are  available  at cheaper  rates.  This  is  because  when  shops  are  in permanent buildings, they incur a lot of expenditure –  they  have  to  pay  rent,  electricity,  fees  to  the government.  They  also  have  to  pay  wages  to  their workers. In weekly markets, these shop owners store the things they sell at home. Most of them are helped by their family members and, hence, do not need to hire  workers.  Weekly  markets  also  have  a  large number of shops selling the same goods which means there is competition among them. If some trader were to charge a high price, people would move to another shop where the same thing may be available more cheaply or where the buyer can bargain and bring the price down.  One of the advantages of weekly markets is that most  things  you  need  are  available  at  one  place. Whether  you  want  vegetables,  groceries  or  cloth items, utensils – all of them can be found here. You do not have to go to different areas to buy different things. People also prefer going to a market where they have a choice and a variety of goods.  Shops in the neighbourhood  We have seen that the weekly markets offer a variety of  goods.  However,  we  also  buy  things  from  other kinds  of  markets.  There  are  many  shops  that  sell goods and services in our neighbourhoods. We may buy milk from the dairy, groceries from departmental stores, stationery, eatables or medicines from other  Rationalised 2023-24Sujata and Kavita were sent to buy groceries from their neighbourhood shop. This was the shop they usually went to. It was crowded today. The shop  owner  managed  the  shop herself with two helpers. When they managed to get into the shop, Sujata dictated  a  list  to  her.  She  in  turn began asking her helpers to weigh and  pack  the  items.  Meanwhile Kavita looked around…  On  the  top  left  shelf  there  were different brands of detergent cakes. Another  shelf  had  toothpastes, talcum  powder,  shampoo,  hair  oil. The  different  brands  and  different colours looked so attractive.  On the floor lay a few sacks.  It took almost 20 minutes to weigh and  pack  all  the  groceries.   Then Sujata showed her “notebook.”  The woman  noted  the  amount  of ` 3000 in the notebook and gave it back.    She  also  noted  the  amount in her big register.  Then Sujata took the heavy bags out of the shop.  Her family will pay for the purchases in the first week of next month.  shops.  Many  of  these  are  permanent  shops,  while others  are  roadside  stalls  such  as  that  of  the vegetable  hawker,  the  fruit  vendor,  the  mechanic, etc.  Shops in the neighbourhood are useful in many ways.  They are near our home and we can go there on any day of the week.  Usually, the buyer and seller know each other and these shops also provide goods on  credit.  This  means  that  you  can  pay  for  the purchases  later,  as  we  saw  in  Sujata’s  case,  for example.  Why did Sujata carry a notebook? Do you think this system is  useful? Can there be problems?  What are the different kinds of shops that you find in your  neighbourhood? What do you purchase from them?  Why are goods sold in permanent  shops costlier than those sold in the weekly markets or by roadside  hawkers?  Chapter 7: Markets Around Us  79  Rationalised 2023-24You  might  have  noticed  that  there  are  different kinds of sellers even in the neighbourhood markets. Some of them have permanent shops and others sell their goods on the roadside.  Anzal Mall is a five-floor shopping complex. Kavita and Sujata were enjoying  going  up  and  down  in the  lift.    It  seemed  as  if  it  was made of glass and they were able to see outside as they went up. It was fascinating to see so many different kinds of shops such as the ice-cream, burger, pizza and other  food  shops;  shops  full  of home  appliances;  footwear  and items  as  well  as leather  bookshops.  While  wandering  about  on  the third floor they entered a shop that was selling branded ready- made clothes.The security guard looked at them as if he wanted to stop them but he did not say anything. They  looked  at  some dresses and then looked at the price tag. None of them was less than ` 3,000, almost five times the weekly market price!  Sujata whispered to Kavita, “I’ll take you to another shop which has good quality ready-made clothes at more reasonable prices”.  Why do you think the guard  Shopping complexes and malls  wanted to stop Kavita and Sujata from entering the shop? What  would you say if someone stops you from entering a shop in a  market?  So  far  we  have  seen  two  kinds  of  marketplaces  – weekly markets and markets in our neighbourhood. There are other markets in the urban area that have many shops, popularly called shopping complexes. These days, in many urban areas, you also have large multi-storeyed air-conditioned buildings with shops on different floors, known as malls. In these urban markets,  you  get  both  branded  and  non-branded goods. As you have read in the chapter on advertising,  80 Social and Political Life  Rationalised 2023-24branded  goods  are  expensive,  often  promoted  by advertising  and  claims  of  better  quality.  The companies  producing  these  products  sell  them through shops in large urban markets and, at times, through  special  showrooms.  As  compared  to  non- branded  goods,  fewer  people  can  afford  to  buy branded ones.  Chain of markets  In  the  previous  sections,  you  have  read  about different markets from where we buy goods. From where do you think shop-owners procure their goods? Goods  are  produced  in  factories,  on  farms  and  in homes.  However,  we  don’t  buy  directly  from  the factory or from the farm. Nor would the producers be interested in selling us small quantities such as one kilo of vegetables or one plastic mug.  The people in between the producer and the final consumer are the traders. The wholesale trader first buys  goods  in  large  quantities.  For  example,  the vegetable wholesale trader will not buy a few kilos of vegetables,  but  will  buy  in  large  lots  of  25  to  100 kilos.  These  will  then  be  sold  to  other  traders.  In these  markets,  buying  and  selling  takes  place between traders. It is through these links of traders that  goods  reach  faraway  places.  The  trader  who finally sells this to the consumer, is the retailer. This could be a trader in a weekly market, a hawker in the neighbourhood or a shop in a shopping complex.  We  can  understand  this  with  the  help  of  the  following examples –  Every city has areas for wholesale markets. This is where goods first reach and are then supplied to other traders. The roadside hawker whom you read about earlier would have purchased a large quantity of plastic items from a wholesale trader in the town. He, in turn, might have bought these from another, even  bigger  wholesale  trader  in  the  city.  The  city  Why do people not bargain in  shops located in malls whereas they bargain in weekly markets?  How do you think your neighbourhood shop gets its  goods? Find out and explain with some examples.  Why is a wholesale trader  necessary?  Azadpur  Daryaganj  Keshopur  Okhla  The above map of Delhi shows four of the 10 wholesale markets in the city.  Chapter 7: Markets Around Us  81  Rationalised 2023-24wholesale trader would have bought a large quantity of plastic items from the factory and stored them in a godown. In this way, a chain of markets is set up. When we purchase, we may not be aware of the chain of markets through which these goods travel before they reach us.  Aftab – The wholesaler in the city  Aftab is one of the wholesale traders who purchases in bulk. His business starts around 2 o’clock in the morning when vegetables reach the market. This is the time when the vegetable market or mandi starts buzzing with activity. The vegetables come in trucks, matadors, tractor trolleys from farms both near and far. Soon the process  of  auctions  begins. Aftab  participates  in  this  auction  and decides what he will buy.  Today, for example, he bought 5 quintals of cauliflower, 10 quintals of onions. He has a shop in the market where he stores the vegetables that he has bought. From here he sells to hawkers and shopkeepers who start coming to the market around six in the morning. They have to organise their purchases so that they can start their shop for the day around ten in the morning.  Markets everywhere  So  far  we  have  seen  different  marketplaces  where people buy and sell a variety of goods and services. All these markets are in a specific locality and work in a particular manner and time. However, it is not always necessary that one has to go to the market to purchase goods. You can place orders for a variety of things through the phone and these days through the  Internet,  and  the  goods  are  delivered  at  your home. In clinics and nursing homes, you may have noticed  sales  representatives  waiting  for  doctors. Such persons are also engaged in the selling of goods. Thus,  buying  and  selling  takes  place  in  different ways, not necessarily through shops in the market.  The markets that we looked at above are the ones that we recognise easily. However, there are markets that we may not be so aware of. This is because a  82 Social and Political Life  Rationalised 2023-24People in urban areas can enter markets without stepping out of their homes via the Internet. They use their credit cards to make ‘online purchases’.  A car being put together in a factory.  large number of goods are bought and sold that we don’t  use  directly.  For  example,  a  farmer  uses fertilisers  to  grow  crops  that  he  purchases  from special shops in the city and they, in turn get them from factories.  A car factory purchases engine, gears, petrol tanks, axles, wheels, etc., from various other factories.  We  don’t  usually  see  all  the  buying  and selling, but only the final product – the car in the showroom. The story is similar for any other good.  Markets and equality  In this chapter, we have looked at shop owners in a weekly  market  and  those  in  a  shopping  complex. They are very different people. One is a small trader with little money to run the shop whereas the other is able to spend a lot of money to set up the shop. They also earn unequal amounts. The weekly market trader earns little compared to the profit of a regular shop owner in a shopping complex. Similarly, buyers are differently placed. There are many who are not able to afford the cheapest of goods while others are busy shopping in malls. Thus, whether we can be buyers or sellers in these different markets depends, among other things, on the money that we have.  We have also examined  the chain of markets that is formed before goods can reach us. It is through  Chapter 7: Markets Around Us  83  Rationalised 2023-24Malls, like the one above, sell expensive and branded goods.  this chain that what is produced in one place reaches people  everywhere.

37,37,0,"R E T P A H  7C  Markets Around Us  We go to the market to buy many things – vegetables, soap, toothpaste, masala, bread, rice, dal, clothes, notebooks, biscuits, etc. If we make a list of the goods that we purchase, it would be really long. There are many kinds of markets that we may visit for our everyday needs: these can include shops, hawker’s stalls in our neighbourhood, a weekly market, a large shopping complex, perhaps even a mall. In this chapter, we look at some of these markets and try to understand how the goods that are sold there reach buyers, who these buyers are, who these sellers are, and the sorts of problems they face.  76 Social and Political Life  Rationalised 2023-247777  Rationalised 2023-24Why do people go to a weekly market? Give three reasons.  Weekly market  Who are the sellers in a weekly  market? Why don’t we find big business persons in these  markets?  Why are things cheap in the weekly market?  Explain with an example how  people bargain in the market. Can you think of a situation where the  bargain would be unfair?  Sameer: Seller of clothes  Sameer is a small trader in the weekly market.  He  buys  clothes  from  a  large trader in the town and sells them in six different  markets  in  a  week.  He  and other cloth sellers move in groups. They hire a mini van for this. His customers are  from  villages  that  are  near  the marketplace. At  festival  times,  such  as during  Deepavali  or  Pongal,  he  does good business.  78 Social and Political Life  A weekly market is so called because it is held on a specific day of the week. Weekly markets do not have permanent shops. Traders set up shops for the day and then close them up in the evening.  Then they may set up at a different place the next day. There are thousands of such markets in India. People come here for their everyday requirements.  Many  things  in  weekly  markets  are  available  at cheaper  rates.  This  is  because  when  shops  are  in permanent buildings, they incur a lot of expenditure –  they  have  to  pay  rent,  electricity,  fees  to  the government.  They  also  have  to  pay  wages  to  their workers. In weekly markets, these shop owners store the things they sell at home. Most of them are helped by their family members and, hence, do not need to hire  workers.  Weekly  markets  also  have  a  large number of shops selling the same goods which means there is competition among them. If some trader were to charge a high price, people would move to another shop where the same thing may be available more cheaply or where the buyer can bargain and bring the price down.  One of the advantages of weekly markets is that most  things  you  need  are  available  at  one  place. Whether  you  want  vegetables,  groceries  or  cloth items, utensils – all of them can be found here. You do not have to go to different areas to buy different things. People also prefer going to a market where they have a choice and a variety of goods.  Shops in the neighbourhood  We have seen that the weekly markets offer a variety of  goods.  However,  we  also  buy  things  from  other kinds  of  markets.  There  are  many  shops  that  sell goods and services in our neighbourhoods. We may buy milk from the dairy, groceries from departmental stores, stationery, eatables or medicines from other  Rationalised 2023-24Sujata and Kavita were sent to buy groceries from their neighbourhood shop. This was the shop they usually went to. It was crowded today. The shop  owner  managed  the  shop herself with two helpers. When they managed to get into the shop, Sujata dictated  a  list  to  her.  She  in  turn began asking her helpers to weigh and  pack  the  items.  Meanwhile Kavita looked around…  On  the  top  left  shelf  there  were different brands of detergent cakes. Another  shelf  had  toothpastes, talcum  powder,  shampoo,  hair  oil. The  different  brands  and  different colours looked so attractive.  On the floor lay a few sacks.  It took almost 20 minutes to weigh and  pack  all  the  groceries.   Then Sujata showed her “notebook.”  The woman  noted  the  amount  of ` 3000 in the notebook and gave it back.    She  also  noted  the  amount in her big register.  Then Sujata took the heavy bags out of the shop.  Her family will pay for the purchases in the first week of next month.  shops.  Many  of  these  are  permanent  shops,  while others  are  roadside  stalls  such  as  that  of  the vegetable  hawker,  the  fruit  vendor,  the  mechanic, etc.  Shops in the neighbourhood are useful in many ways.  They are near our home and we can go there on any day of the week.  Usually, the buyer and seller know each other and these shops also provide goods on  credit.  This  means  that  you  can  pay  for  the purchases  later,  as  we  saw  in  Sujata’s  case,  for example.  Why did Sujata carry a notebook? Do you think this system is  useful? Can there be problems?  What are the different kinds of shops that you find in your  neighbourhood? What do you purchase from them?  Why are goods sold in permanent  shops costlier than those sold in the weekly markets or by roadside  hawkers?  Chapter 7: Markets Around Us  79  Rationalised 2023-24You  might  have  noticed  that  there  are  different kinds of sellers even in the neighbourhood markets. Some of them have permanent shops and others sell their goods on the roadside.  Anzal Mall is a five-floor shopping complex. Kavita and Sujata were enjoying  going  up  and  down  in the  lift.    It  seemed  as  if  it  was made of glass and they were able to see outside as they went up. It was fascinating to see so many different kinds of shops such as the ice-cream, burger, pizza and other  food  shops;  shops  full  of home  appliances;  footwear  and items  as  well  as leather  bookshops.  While  wandering  about  on  the third floor they entered a shop that was selling branded ready- made clothes.The security guard looked at them as if he wanted to stop them but he did not say anything. They  looked  at  some dresses and then looked at the price tag. None of them was less than ` 3,000, almost five times the weekly market price!  Sujata whispered to Kavita, “I’ll take you to another shop which has good quality ready-made clothes at more reasonable prices”.  Why do you think the guard  Shopping complexes and malls  wanted to stop Kavita and Sujata from entering the shop? What  would you say if someone stops you from entering a shop in a  market?  So  far  we  have  seen  two  kinds  of  marketplaces  – weekly markets and markets in our neighbourhood. There are other markets in the urban area that have many shops, popularly called shopping complexes. These days, in many urban areas, you also have large multi-storeyed air-conditioned buildings with shops on different floors, known as malls. In these urban markets,  you  get  both  branded  and  non-branded goods. As you have read in the chapter on advertising,  80 Social and Political Life  Rationalised 2023-24branded  goods  are  expensive,  often  promoted  by advertising  and  claims  of  better  quality.  The companies  producing  these  products  sell  them through shops in large urban markets and, at times, through  special  showrooms.  As  compared  to  non- branded  goods,  fewer  people  can  afford  to  buy branded ones.  Chain of markets  In  the  previous  sections,  you  have  read  about different markets from where we buy goods. From where do you think shop-owners procure their goods? Goods  are  produced  in  factories,  on  farms  and  in homes.  However,  we  don’t  buy  directly  from  the factory or from the farm. Nor would the producers be interested in selling us small quantities such as one kilo of vegetables or one plastic mug.  The people in between the producer and the final consumer are the traders. The wholesale trader first buys  goods  in  large  quantities.  For  example,  the vegetable wholesale trader will not buy a few kilos of vegetables,  but  will  buy  in  large  lots  of  25  to  100 kilos.  These  will  then  be  sold  to  other  traders.  In these  markets,  buying  and  selling  takes  place between traders. It is through these links of traders that  goods  reach  faraway  places.  The  trader  who finally sells this to the consumer, is the retailer. This could be a trader in a weekly market, a hawker in the neighbourhood or a shop in a shopping complex.  We  can  understand  this  with  the  help  of  the  following examples –  Every city has areas for wholesale markets. This is where goods first reach and are then supplied to other traders. The roadside hawker whom you read about earlier would have purchased a large quantity of plastic items from a wholesale trader in the town. He, in turn, might have bought these from another, even  bigger  wholesale  trader  in  the  city.  The  city  Why do people not bargain in  shops located in malls whereas they bargain in weekly markets?  How do you think your neighbourhood shop gets its  goods? Find out and explain with some examples.  Why is a wholesale trader  necessary?  Azadpur  Daryaganj  Keshopur  Okhla  The above map of Delhi shows four of the 10 wholesale markets in the city.  Chapter 7: Markets Around Us  81  Rationalised 2023-24wholesale trader would have bought a large quantity of plastic items from the factory and stored them in a godown. In this way, a chain of markets is set up. When we purchase, we may not be aware of the chain of markets through which these goods travel before they reach us.  Aftab – The wholesaler in the city  Aftab is one of the wholesale traders who purchases in bulk. His business starts around 2 o’clock in the morning when vegetables reach the market. This is the time when the vegetable market or mandi starts buzzing with activity. The vegetables come in trucks, matadors, tractor trolleys from farms both near and far. Soon the process  of  auctions  begins. Aftab  participates  in  this  auction  and decides what he will buy.  Today, for example, he bought 5 quintals of cauliflower, 10 quintals of onions. He has a shop in the market where he stores the vegetables that he has bought. From here he sells to hawkers and shopkeepers who start coming to the market around six in the morning. They have to organise their purchases so that they can start their shop for the day around ten in the morning.  Markets everywhere  So  far  we  have  seen  different  marketplaces  where people buy and sell a variety of goods and services. All these markets are in a specific locality and work in a particular manner and time. However, it is not always necessary that one has to go to the market to purchase goods. You can place orders for a variety of things through the phone and these days through the  Internet,  and  the  goods  are  delivered  at  your home. In clinics and nursing homes, you may have noticed  sales  representatives  waiting  for  doctors. Such persons are also engaged in the selling of goods. Thus,  buying  and  selling  takes  place  in  different ways, not necessarily through shops in the market.  The markets that we looked at above are the ones that we recognise easily. However, there are markets that we may not be so aware of. This is because a  82 Social and Political Life  Rationalised 2023-24People in urban areas can enter markets without stepping out of their homes via the Internet. They use their credit cards to make ‘online purchases’.  A car being put together in a factory.  large number of goods are bought and sold that we don’t  use  directly.  For  example,  a  farmer  uses fertilisers  to  grow  crops  that  he  purchases  from special shops in the city and they, in turn get them from factories.  A car factory purchases engine, gears, petrol tanks, axles, wheels, etc., from various other factories.

It begins with the production of cotton and ends with the sale of the shirt. We shall see that a chain of markets links the producer of cotton to the buyer of the shirt in the supermarket. Buying and selling takes place at every step in the chain. Does everyone benefit equally from this? Or do some people benefit more than others? We shall find out.  86 Social and Political Life  Rationalised 2023-24A cotton farmer in Kurnool  Swapna, a small farmer in Kurnool (Andhra Pradesh) grows cotton on her small piece of land. The bolls of the  cotton  plant  are  ripe  and  some  have  already burst, so Swapna is busy picking cotton. The bolls, which carry the cotton in them, do not burst open all  at  once  so  it  takes  several  days  to  harvest  the cotton.  Once the cotton is collected, instead of selling it at Kurnool  cotton  market,  Swapna  and  her  husband take the harvest to the local trader. At the beginning of  the  cropping  season,  Swapna  had  borrowed ` 2,500 from the trader at a very high interest rate to  buy  seeds,  fertilisers,  pesticides  for  cultivation. At that time, the local trader made Swapna agree to another condition. He made her promise to sell all her cotton to him.  Cultivation of cotton requires high levels of inputs such  as  fertilisers  and  pesticides  and  the  farmers have to incur heavy expenses on account of these. Most often, the small farmers need to borrow money to meet these expenses.  At  the  trader’s  yard,  two  of  his  men  weigh  the bags of cotton. At a price of ` 1,500 per quintal, the cotton  fetches  `  6,000.  The  trader  deducts ` 3,000 for repayment of loan and interest and pays Swapna ` 3,000.  Swapna: ` 3,000 only!  Trader:  Cotton  is  selling  cheap.  There  is  a  lot  of cotton in the market.  Swapna:  I  have  toiled  so  hard  for  four  months  to grow this cotton. You can see how fine and clean the cotton is this time. I had hoped to get a much better price.  Did Swapna get a fair price on the cotton?  Why did the trader pay Swapna  a low price?  Where do you think large farmers would sell their cotton? How is  their situation different from Swapna?  1. Trader sells the cotton at the Kurnool cotton market.  2. Ginning mill buys the cotton.  3. Ginning mill removes the seeds and presses the cotton into bales.  4. Spinning mill buys the bales.  5. Spinning mill spins the cotton into yarn.  6. Spinning mill sells the yarn to yarn dealers.  Chapter 8: A Shirt in the Market  87 87  Rationalised 2023-24Trader: Amma, I am giving you a good price. Other traders are not even paying this much. You can check at the Kurnool market, if you do not believe me.  Swapna: Don’t be angry. How can I doubt you? I had only  hoped  that  we  would  earn  enough  from  the cotton crop to last us a few months.  Though Swapna knows that cotton will sell for at least ` 1,800 per quintal, she doesn’t argue further. The trader is a powerful man in the village and the farmers have to depend on him for loans not only for cultivation, but also to meet other exigencies such as illnesses, children’s school fees. Also, there are times  in  the  year  when  there  is  no  work  and  no income for the farmers, so borrowing money is the only means of survival.  Swapna’s earning from cotton cultivation is barely more than what she might have earned as a wage labourer.  The cloth market of Erode  Erode’s bi-weekly cloth market in Tamil Nadu is one of  the  largest  cloth  markets  in  the  world.  A  large variety of cloth is sold in this market. Cloth that is made  by  weavers  in  the  villages  around  is  also brought here for sale. Around the market are offices of cloth merchants who buy this cloth. Other traders from  many  south  Indian  towns  also  come  and purchase cloth in this market.    On  market  days,  you  would  also  find  weavers bringing cloth that has been made on order from the merchant. These merchants supply cloth on order to garment manufacturers and exporters around the country.  They  purchase  the  yarn  and  give instructions to the weavers about the kind of cloth that is to be made. In the following example, we can see how this is done.  A shop in Erode.  88 Social and Political Life  Rationalised 2023-241  2  3  Putting-out system– weavers producing cloth at home  The merchant distributes work among the weavers based on the orders he has received for cloth. The weavers get the yarn from the merchant and supply him  the  cloth.  For  the  weavers,  this  arrangement seemingly has two advantages. The weavers do not have to spend their money on purchase of yarn. Also, the problem of selling the finished cloth is taken care of.  Weavers  know  from  the  outset  what  cloth  they should make and how much of it is to be woven.  However, this dependence on the merchants both for  raw  materials  and  markets  means  that  the merchants have a lot of power. They give orders for what is to be made and they pay a very low price for making  the  cloth.  The  weavers  have  no  way  of  1.This is a merchant’s shop in the bazaar. Over the years, these traders have developed extensive contacts with garment firms around the country from whom they get orders. These traders purchase the yarn (thread) from others. 2. The weavers live in villages around and take the yarn supplied by these traders to their homes where the looms are located in sheds adjacent to their houses. This photograph shows a powerloom in one such home. The weavers and their families spend long hours working on these looms. Most weaving units have about  2–8 powerlooms on which the yarn is woven into cloth. A variety of sarees, towels, shirting, ladies dress material and bedsheets are produced in these looms. 3. They then bring back the finished cloth to the traders. Here, they can be seen getting ready to go to the merchant in the town. The trader keeps an account of the yarn given and pays them money for weaving this into cloth.  What are the following people doing at the Erode cloth market –  merchants, weavers, exporters?  In what ways are weavers dependent on cloth merchants?

How? Discuss.  knowing  who  they  are  making  the  cloth  for  or  at what price it will be sold. At the cloth market, the merchants sell the cloth to the garment factories. In this  way,  the  market  works  more  in  favour  of  the merchants.  Do  you  find  similar  ‘putting-out’ arrangements in making papads,  masalas, beedis? Find out about this in your area and discuss in  class.  You might have heard of cooperatives in your area. It could  be in milk, provisions, paddy, etc. Find out for whose benefit they  were set up?  Weavers invest all their savings or borrow money at high interest rates to buy looms. Each loom costs ` 20,000, so a small weaver with two looms has to invest ` 40,000. The work on these looms cannot be done alone. The weaver and another adult member of his family work upto 12 hours a day to produce cloth.  For  all  this  work,  they  earn  about ` 3,500 per month.  The arrangement between the merchant and the weavers  is  an  example  of  putting-out  system, whereby the merchant supplies the raw material and receives the finished product. It is prevalent in the weaving industry in most regions of India.  Weaver’s cooperative  We  have  seen  that  the  weavers  are  paid  very  little  by  the merchant under the putting out system. Weaver’s cooperatives are one way to reduce the dependence on the merchant and to earn a higher income for the weavers.  In a cooperative, people with common interests come together and work for their mutual benefit. In a weaver’s cooperative, the weavers form a group and take  up  certain  activities  collectively. They  procure  yarn  from the  yarn  dealer  and  distribute  it  among  the  weavers. The cooperative also does the marketing. So, the role of the merchant is reduced, and weavers get a fair price on the cloth.  At times, the government helps the cooperatives by buying cloth from them at a reasonable price. For instance, the Tamil Nadu government runs a Free School Uniform programme in the state. The government procures the cloth for this programme from the powerloom weaver’s cooperatives.  Similarly, the government buys cloth from the handloom weaver’s cooperatives and sells it through stores known as Co-optex. You might have come across one of these stores in your town.  90 Social and Political Life  Rationalised 2023-24The garment exporting factory near Delhi  Women workers sewing buttons in a garment factory.  The  Erode  merchant  supplies  the  cotton  cloth produced  by  the  weavers  to  a  garment  exporting factory  near  Delhi.  The  garment  exporting  factory will use the cloth to make shirts. The shirts will be exported to foreign buyers. Among the foreign buyers are businesspersons from the US and Europe who run a chain of stores. These large stores do business strictly on their own terms. They demand the lowest prices from the supplier. In addition, they set high standards  for  quality  of  production  and  timely delivery. Any defects or delay in delivery is dealt with strictly. So, the exporter tries his best to meet the conditions set by these powerful buyers.  Faced with such pressures from the buyers, the garment exporting factories, in turn, try to cut costs. They get the maximum work out of the workers at the  lowest  possible  wages.  This  way  they  can maximise  their  own  profits  and  also  supply  the garments to foreign buyers at a cheap price.  What are the demands foreign  buyers make on the garment exporters?

Let us recall who  were  the  people  who  were  involved  in  this process of buying and selling. Did they all gain as much? There were people who made profits in the market  and  there  were  some  who  did  not  gain  as much  from  this  buying  and  selling.  Despite  their having toiled very hard, they earned little. Can you place them in the table shown here?  Market and equality  The foreign businessperson made huge profits in the market.  Compared  to  this,  the  garment  exporter made only moderate profits. On the other hand, the earnings of the workers at the garment export factory are barely enough to cover their day-to-day needs. Similarly, we saw the small cotton farmer and the weaver at Erode put in long hours of hard work. But they did not get a fair price in the market for what they  produced.  The  merchants  or  traders  are somewhere  in  between.  Compared  to  the  weavers, they have earned more but it is still much less than the  exporter.  Thus,  not  everyone  gains  equally  in the market. Democracy is also about getting a fair wage in the market. Whether it is Kanta or Swapna, if families don’t earn enough how would they think of themselves as equal to others?  On  one  hand,  the  market  offers  people opportunities for work and to be able to sell things that  they  grow  or  produce.  It  could  be  the  farmer selling cotton or the weaver producing cloth. On the other hand, it is usually the rich and the powerful  Chapter 8: A Shirt in the Market  93  Rationalised 2023-24Did you know that the readymade clothes that you buy require the work of so many different persons?  that  get  the  maximum  earnings  from  the  market. These are the people who have money and own the factories, the large shops, large land holdings, etc. The poor have to depend on the rich and the powerful for various things. They have to depend for loans (as in  the  case  of  Swapna,  the  small  farmer),  for  raw materials and marketing of their goods (weavers in the  putting  out  system),  and  most  often  for employment  (workers  at  the  garment  factory). Because of this dependence, the poor are exploited in the market. There are ways to overcome these such as forming cooperatives of producers and ensuring that laws are followed strictly.

What made Swapna sell the cotton to the trader instead  of selling at the Kurnool cotton market?  2. Describe the conditions of employment  as well as the wages of workers in the garment exporting factory. Do  you think the workers get a fair deal?  3. Think  of  something  common  that  we  use.  It  could  be  sugar, tea, milk, pen, paper, pencil, etc. Discuss through what chain of markets this reaches you. Can you think of  the people that help in the production or trade?  4. Arrange  the  statements  given  alongside  in  the  correct  order  and  then  fill  in  the  numbers  in  the  cotton  bolls accordingly. The first two have already been done for you.  1. Swapna sells the cotton to the trader. 2. Customers buy these shirts in a supermarket. 3. Trader sells cotton to the Ginning Mill. 4.
