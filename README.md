# Document Classification Project

This project aims to solve a document classification problem using LSTM-based deep learning models.

## Project Overview

The project involves several steps:

1. **Data Gathering**: We first gather the data required for the document classification task.
2. **Data Cleaning**: The gathered data is then cleaned and preprocessed.
3. **Data Merging**: The data of different classes is merged to create a comprehensive dataset.
4. **Tokenization**: The data is tokenized to convert the text into a format that can be used by the model.
5. **Embedding**: We create embeddings using the pickled version of GloVe embeddings.
6. **Model Creation**: An LSTM-based deep learning model is created.
7. **Model Training and Testing**: The model is trained and tested on the dataset.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed the latest version of Python and Tensorflow.
- You have downloaded the pickled version of GloVe embeddings. You can download it from here.
